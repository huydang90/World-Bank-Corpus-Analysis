Asian Development BankAbout the Asian Development Bank

ADB's vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member

countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region's

many successes, it remains home to two thirds of the world's poor. Nearly 1.7 billion people in the region

live on $2 or less a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth,

environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.

Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments

for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees,

grants, and technical assistance. In 2007, it approved $10.1 billion of loans, $673 million of grant

projects, and technical assistance amounting to $243 million.

anceMessage from the
President and Chairman of
the Board of Directors

The year 2007 proved to be, overall, another banner year
for developing Asian economies. Again led by strong
growth in the People’s Republic of China and India, the
economies of developing Asia and the Pacific expanded
by 8.7%, slightly faster than in the previous year. This
growth was widespread, with countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines picking up momentum.

In the latter half of the year, storm clouds began
to gather on the international economic horizon. Asia
has managed to weather the storm, buoyed by macroeconomic fundamentals that have been substantially
strengthened since the financial crisis of 1997/98. However, the region is by no means immune to international
shocks. External instability demands that developing Asian countries continue to implement reforms to
anchor and increase their resilience to external risks.

This is particularly important given the difficult
development challenges that still lie ahead. Asia and the
Pacific remain a region of two faces, with hundreds of
millions still mired in poverty and growing economic
disparities among and within countries. These disparities
threaten both future growth and regional and global stability. Continued rapid economic growth is essential to
reduce poverty, but it must be inclusive, to provide jobs
for the poor and generate investment in the critical areas
of health, education, and social safety net systems.

Another crucial challenge facing the region is to
put growth on an environmentally sustainable footing. Alongside the environmental degradation that has
accompanied the region’s development, the growing
reality of climate change puts at risk the lives and livelihoods of millions of the region’s poor. In recent years,
and certainly in 2007, the 10th anniversary of the
Kyoto Protocol, the issue of climate change has risen
to the top of the international development agenda,
and the Asia and Pacific region must play a significant role in generating and implementing regional and
global solutions.

The report of the Eminent Persons Group, tabled
at ADB’s 40th Annual Meeting last May, marked the
launch of an extensive consultation on ADB’s new
long-term strategic framework, Strategy 2020. This

charts an exciting course for ADB from now until
2020. With inclusive growth, environmental sustainability, and regional cooperation and integration
gaining momentum in recent years, ADB is prepared
to focus its efforts to eradicate poverty on these three
agendas, and our long history in the region gives us
a distinct comparative strength with which to do so.
Helping developing member countries pursue these
agendas will ensure stability and more widely shared
prosperity benefiting not only the Asia and Pacific
region but the entire world.

ADB and its donor members began negotiations on
the ninth replenishment of the Asian Development Fund
(ADF X). The region can only prosper and achieve its
full potential if its poorest nations are helped to reach
their aspirations. An expanded ADF X is essential to
support the fight against poverty and to progress toward
the Millennium Development Goals in this part of the
world, and will be used to the benefit of our poorer
countries in full alignment with Strategy 2020.

Looking to operations, it was a very busy, productive, and exciting year for ADB. Our annual loan
approvals grew from $7.4 billion in 2006 to $10.1
billion in 2007, clearly demonstrating the growing
demand for ADB assistance in all parts of the region.
Our relevance as a development institution depends on

Continued rapid economic
growth is essential to reduce
poverty, but it must be
inclusive, to provide jobs

for the poor and generate
investment in the critical
areas of health, education,
and social safety net systemsADB President Haruhiko Kuroda meets villagers in Shaanxi province in the arid loess plateau region of western People’s Republic of China to

better understand their trials and aspirations

our ability to respond effectively to such demands as
the region continues to develop.

Recognizing the important role of the private sector in generating jobs and growth, ADB is placing more
emphasis on private sector operations. In 2007, our private sector operations totaled $1.7 billion, significantly
above recent levels. The private sector will continue
to play an increasingly vital role in the region, and we
expect private sector operations to become a leading
part of ADB operations by 2020.

As the Asia and Pacific region changes, so must ADB
to stay responsive and focused on achieving development results. Since adopting the managing for development results framework in 2004, all of ADB’s country
strategies have been designed to link our interventions
more clearly to expected development outcomes. Our
growing portfolio reflects the continued improvements
we are making in, among others, the quality of ADB
projects; the financing options we offer; the processing
time for projects and consultant recruitment; and our
partnerships with nongovernment organizations, the
private sector, and other development partners.

Of course, ADB’s talented and dedicated staff members are central to these efforts. To ensure our ongoing

effectiveness, we continue to emphasize staff development.
We recently completed our 2008 staff engagement survey
and look forward to the review of ADB’s human resource
strategy, which will be undertaken this year. It is essential
that we ensure ADB’s continued ability to attract and retain
the high-quality staff members needed to support the next
phase of Asia’s economic and social development.

We face the future with hope and confidence. We
believe that our assistance, and our useful, timely, and
relevant knowledge products, will significantly help our
developing member countries toward transforming the
region into one free of poverty, where all citizens can
participate in and benefit from inclusive, environmentally sustainable growth. We look forward to the continued support of all our partners and shareholders as
we take the next steps on this exciting journey.

President and Chairman
Board of DirectorsIn keeping with ADB’s ongoing and comprehensive
reform agenda, the Board of Directors undertook

a series of reviews that expanded ADB’s capacity
to assist member countries, and to do so more
efficiently and with better results. It endorsed

new country partnership strategies with several
countries, and paid special attention to the

situation and challenges facing the region’s
weakest and most vulnerable economies
and societies.The Board also supported revisions to ADB’s grant
framework linking a country’s eligibility for grants
to its debt status, and explored more appropriate and
more reliable ways of assessing creditworthiness.

To strengthen ADB’s internal capabilities and institutional effectiveness, the Board pressed on with reforms
intended to bolster ADB’s financial position, improve the
capabilities of its staff, and enable ADB to operate more
efficiently. These reforms were made even more urgent
by the continuing growth in ADB’s operations: the total
loan portfolio approved by the Board in 2007 exceeded
$10 billion for the first time.

With the second medium-term strategy period
drawing to a close and the new long-term strategic
framework set to take effect in 2008, the Board was
acutely aware of the need to realign ADB’s policies and
programs with the emerging new scenario in the Asia
and Pacific region.

Board Meetings

The Board meetings covered a broad range of policy,
financial, and administrative concerns, among them,
ADB’s approach to engaging with weakly performing countries and to providing debt relief to heavily
indebted poor countries.

The Board reviewed ADB’s prudential exposure
limits on nonsovereign operations, the 1998 graduation policy, and the loan charges and allocation of
2006 net income. It discussed possible revisions in the
framework for Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants
and the borrowing program for 2008.

The Board met on ADB’s annual financial statements, its budget for 2008, its work program and
budget framework (2008-2010), and the salaries and
benefits for national officers and administrative staff
at headquarters, as well as those for professional staff.

It reviewed the 3-year rolling work program for
2008-2010 and budget for 2008 of the Asian Development Bank Institute. It discussed a paper on the resources
of ADB and recommended its consideration by the Board
of Governors at the Fortieth Annual Meeting.

Other Meetings

In September, a delegation from the World Bank’s
Board of Directors met with ADB’s Board of Directors to discuss board effectiveness and other issues of
mutual interest.

In October, the ADB Board held a retreat with Management to discuss the long-term strategic framework.
The retreat proved helpful in getting early feedback on
the framework.

Members of the Board also attended the first
donors’ meeting on the ninth replenishment of the

ADF (ADF X) in Sydney, Australia, in September, and
the second meeting in Vientiane, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, in November.

Country Partnership Strategies

The country partnership strategy or CPS (formerly the
country strategy and program) maps out the ways that
ADB can best partner with its member countries over
the time frame of the CPS (usually 5 years), given each
country’s situation, challenges, and priorities. The CPS
also enables ADB to evaluate the country’s development performance over the CPS period.

The Board endorsed three CPSs—for the Maldives (2007-2011), Thailand (2007-2011), and Tonga
(2007-2012)—as well as a joint country support strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic (2007-2010).

Board Group Visits

Members of the Board made two visits around the
region to get a firsthand view of ADB projects and
their impact, and to meet with government officials
and other development stakeholders.

On 15-28 February, a team visited Papua New
Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. Another team visited Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic on 16-26 June.

The visits strengthened ADB’s relationship with its
development partners and generated valuable feedback.

BOARD COMMITTEES

The Board is supported in its work by standing committees on audit, budget review, compliance review,
development effectiveness, and ethics.

Audit Committee

The committee assists the Board in its oversight of
ADB’s financial reporting and audits, including internal controls.

Among the review and discussion topics taken up
by the committee were the annual report of the Office
of the Auditor General’s Integrity Division, the audit
recommendation and implementation report of the
outside auditors (June and December), ADB’s annual
financial statements, the review of private fund activities and analysis of the performance of fund managers, the audit strategy memorandum, and the audit
risk assessment methodology. The committee also
reviewed ADB’s risk management capability and the
monitoring of progress in integrating risk management in ADB.

The committee monitored and reviewed key issues
and actions, including financial management and

SYOLDAYIG JO GYVOd10

accounting standards, information technology issues
affecting key financial and accounting systems, and
travel-related cost-saving measures.

The committee met 10 times.

The committee discussed the President’s planning
directions in preparation for the drafting of the work
program and budget framework (2008-2010). Later
in the year, the committee met with the vice presidents
and exchanged views on the draft highlights of the
work program and budget framework. The committee
also promoted a demand-driven approach to knowledge management, value addition to clients, and a clear
strategic direction in ADB’s knowledge products to
achieve better results.

The committee discussed the 2008 draft budget,
and noted the continuing efforts of regional departments to boost portfolio performance by improving
disbursements and reducing at-risk projects. The committee noted that the growth in the work program was
paralleled by the departments’ efforts to improve efficiency, skills mix, and staff redeployment. The committee confirmed that the draft budget for 2008 was

consistent with the work plans and appropriate for
consideration by the Board.
The committee met 10 times.

Set up under ADB’s accountability mechanism, the
committee clears the Compliance Review Panel’s proposed terms of reference and time frame for compliance reviews. The committee also comments on the
draft monitoring reports of the panel on the implementation of remedial actions approved by the Board.

The committee reviewed the draft monitoring
reports of the panel on the implementation of the
Board-approved remedial actions in the Southern
Transport Development Project in Sri Lanka and the
Chashma Right Bank Irrigation Project (Stage III) in
Pakistan. The monitoring reports are posted on the
panel’s website (www.compliance.adb.org). The committee also informally discussed the compliance review
process with the panel members.

The committee met twice.

Development Effectiveness Committee

The committee was created in 2001 to help the Board
ensure the development effectiveness of ADB programs
and operations.

The committee reviewed and discussed 12 evaluation reports prepared by the Operations Evaluation
Department, and three Management reports on the
implementation of the poverty reduction strategy and
progress in managing for development results. The
committee also deliberated administrative issues.

The four country assistance program evaluations
reviewed and discussed by the committee were those
for the People’s Republic of China, India, Pakistan, and
Sri Lanka. The five special evaluation studies covered the
performance of technical assistance, indigenous peoples

 

safeguards, private sector development and operations,
the energy policy 2000 review, and the Global Environment Facility. Two annual reports were taken up: the
annual report on the performance of the 2006 portfolio
and the annual evaluation review in 2007.

While taking note of the general progress made,
the committee recommended improvements in ADB’s
performance in its programs and operations.

The committee met 13 times.

Ethics Committee

The Board established the committee to address matters of ethics that may arise under the Code of Conduct adopted by the Board in September 2006. The
code provisions apply to all Board members (directors,
alternate directors, and temporary alternate directors)
and to the President.

The committee advises the directors, alternate directors, or the President on actual or potential conflicts of
interest or other ethical issues concerning themselves.
The committee also considers allegations of misconduct

Rajat M. Nag Ursula Schaefer- Bindu N. Lohani Liqun Jin C. Lawrence Shyam P. Bajpai
Preuss Greenwood, Jr.ADB formally began a comprehensive review
of its long-term strategic framework to keep

the institution relevant and effective as a
regional development bank. It convened

a panel of six eminent persons in 2006 to
provide insights on the future of the region
and the role of ADB.15

 

The Eminent Persons Group’s report, commissioned
by President Kuroda and made public in March 2007,
envisioned a dramatically transformed Asia by 2020:
most countries would have conquered widespread
absolute poverty but would be facing formidable development challenges, stemming largely from unprecedented growth and economic successes.

The report urged ADB to become better prepared
to help members meet these challenges by adopting
three mutually complementary strategic directions—
inclusive growth, environmentally sustainable growth,
and shift from a national to a regional and global focus.
To become more responsive and enhance institutional
effectiveness, the report also urged ADB to be more
selective in its operations and to streamline its business
processes further.

Internal and external stakeholders were consulted
extensively on the way forward for ADB. Several inhouse studies, notably on inclusive growth, and a special evaluation study by the Operations Evaluation
Department on the implementation of the long-term
strategic framework (2001-2015) during 2001-2006,
were produced to aid discussion and build consensus.
A retreat was organized in October with ADB’s Board
of Directors and Management to deliberate on the new
long-term strategic framework until 2020 and on measures to enhance ADB’s institutional effectiveness.

The vision of an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty continues to be the foremost aspiration of ADB’s
member countries. Preliminary analysis and consultations, however, have revealed the changing nature
of poverty in the region and the need to place much
greater and concerted attention on inclusive growth:
creating opportunities through economic growth and
private sector development, and giving all citizens more
chances to participate in and benefit from growth. The
increasing importance of environmental sustainability
and the role of regional cooperation and integration
have also been noted.

Under the new long-term strategic framework to
be adopted in 2008, ADB will define its role and strategic directions to guide operations in 2008-2020, with
strong emphasis on achieving development impact in
developing member countries in association with a
wide range of partners within and outside the region.

REPLENISHMENT AND
MANAGEMENT OF ASIAN
DEVELOPMENT FUND RESOURCES

On the sidelines of the 2007 Annual Meeting in Kyoto,
Japan, ADB met informally with donors to the Asian

Development Fund (ADF) in preparation for the negotiation of the ninth replenishment of the ADF (ADF X).

At the first meeting in Sydney, Australia, in September, ADB called for an ADF X significantly larger than
ADF IX, as this replenishment covering 2009-2012
would be the last chance to have an impact on the
Millennium Development Goals by the target date of
2015. New challenges such as climate change, the plight
of weakly performing countries, and the potential for
enhanced regional cooperation also need to be given
special attention. The role and priorities of the ADF in
the international aid architecture were examined, and
the conclusion was that poverty reduction should be the
goal of ADF X. Meeting participants agreed that ADF
operations should be more selective, and endorsed the
proposed sector focus on infrastructure (including rural
and social infrastructure) and education.

Both the meeting in Sydney and the one that followed in Vientiane, Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
in November noted that operational effectiveness had
improved, and highlighted the need to increase institutional effectiveness. Managing for development results
was seen as crucial to this quest, along with human
resource reforms, streamlined business processes, continued strengthening of resident missions, and further decentralization of decision making. Discussions
also centered on the performance-based allocation of
ADF resources, the new grants framework based on
the debt-repayment capacity of recipient countries,
and ADB’s participation in the debt relief initiative
for heavily indebted poor countries. The Operations
Evaluation Department presented preliminary findings
of a special evaluation study on ADF VIII (2001-2004)
and ADF IX (2005-2008), which was critical of the
targeting-of-the-poor approach applied under ADF
VIII but more positive about ADB’s present approach
to poverty reduction. The study recommended that the
ADF be enlarged to accelerate the achievement of the
Millennium Development Goals.

The ADE X replenishment negotiations are expected
to be concluded by early May 2008, ahead of the Annual
Meeting in Madrid, Spain.

DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS

Managing for Development Results

ADB continued to implement the managing for development results (MfDR) initiative as the cornerstone of
its reform agenda. In line with the MfDR Action Plan
for 2006-2008, implementation rests on three key pillars: supporting the capacity of developing member
countries to manage for development results, enhancing ADB’s results orientation, and maintaining effective results partnerships.

Supporting the capacity of developing member countries to manage for development results. With the
introduction of results-based country partnership
strategies, ADB’s regional departments have enhanced
national dialogue on MfDR, with particular attention to country systems and capacity to manage for
outcomes. Technical assistance in support of national
ME£DR agendas, including pilot initiatives financed
from the MfDR Cooperation Fund, continued. In parallel, ADB’s Economics and Research Department is
pursuing a new approach to statistical capacity building (SCB), paying closer attention to weak developing
member countries (DMCs), as well as identifying
longer-term financing for SCB via the Fund for AsiaPacific Statistical Capacity Building.

The Community of Practice on Managing for
Development Results (CoP-MfDR), established in
March 2006 with ADB sponsorship, has emerged as an
important initiative to build sustainable partnerships
and networks in participating DMCs. The CoP-MfDR

now comprises more than 80 active members from
18 DMCs, development partners, private sector and
civil society organizations, and over 200 peripheral
members.

Improving ADB’s results orientation. Results-based
operational tools are now in place and widely used
across ADB. The country programming and related
business processes have been strengthened with revised
guidelines, the design and monitoring frameworks for
results-based projects and country partnership strategies
have improved, and results are increasingly monitored
and discussed with governments during country portfolio reviews, now more often held jointly with other development partners. The results orientation was further
enhanced in institution-wide reports and planning documents, including the annual report on the implementation of the poverty reduction strategy, the reform agenda,
and the progress report on the MfDR Action Plan. In the
interest of greater clarity and simplicity, starting in 2008,
ADB will consolidate these reports into a single review
on development effectiveness.

To support the new development effectiveness
reporting system and the ADF X replenishment process, ADB also started to prepare country briefs on
development effectiveness to give development partners
a better sense of ADB’s key contributions to national
development outcomes and aid effectiveness. A more
comprehensive MfDR curriculum was developed for
staff learning and development. So far, 11 MfDR learning programs, including three programs for directorlevel staff and above, have been implemented.

Maintaining effective results partnerships. ADB remained
a lead member of the emerging global partnership on
MEDR, in particular by cochairing the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)Development Assistance Committee Joint Venture on
ME£DR, contributing to the annual editions of the Common
Performance Assessment System (COMPAS) developed
by multilateral development banks, cosponsoring the
Third International Roundtable on MfDR (Ha Noi, Viet
Nam, February), and sharing knowledge of and experience
in MEDR with other multilateral development banks.

The Operations Evaluation Department independently evaluated the progress of MfDR, and, among
other things, concluded that ADB’s progress and challenges were generally comparable to those of other
multilateral development banks.

Implementing the Paris Declaration

ADB has worked closely with other funding agencies
and partner countries in supporting the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and Harmonization.

To harmonize reporting on implementation with
its partners, ADB is using a quantitative and qualitative monitoring framework similar to that of the
World Bank and OECD. The declaration commitments
are tracked through a set of 12 indicators to measure
implementation status against global targets set for
2010. A first round of monitoring, by OECD in 2006,
covered six ADB member countries. A second round,
by the Strategy and Policy Department in 2007, dealt
with 13 countries.

The monitoring has revealed mixed results thus far.
For some indicators—coordinated technical support, the
use of country public financial management and procurement systems, aid predictability, and joint analytic
work—the results are reassuring, and with some extra
effort the 2010 targets are likely to be achieved. However, for others—the use of program-based approaches
and parallel implementation structures and joint missions—much more needs to be done to reach the desired
goals. ADB is actively engaged with its partner countries
in the run-up to the Third High Level Forum on Aid
Effectiveness (Accra HLF), scheduled in 2008, to help
present a regional perspective and report on progress
made in the Asia and Pacific region.

A special evaluation study by the Operations
Evaluation Department on ADB’s approach to partnering and harmonization found ADB’s achievements
to be substantially under-recorded. Its principal recommendations were to clarify what qualifies (and what
does not) as meeting the Paris declaration commitments, particularly for program-based approaches,
and to strengthen ADB’s management information
systems related to its activities in support of the Paris

declaration. ADB, through its relevant departments
and resident missions, is now working closely with
OECD to consider these recommendations.

ADB's Approach to Weakly Performing
Countries

On 30 May, ADB’s Board of Directors endorsed an
approach to dealing with weakly performing countries
(WPCs). ADB identifies WPCs based on country performance assessments carried out under the performancebased allocation policy, and taking into account conflict
or post-conflict situations in the countries. A WPC is
either ranked in the fourth or fifth quintile during country performance assessments for 2 of the most recent 3
years or considered to be in, or recovering from, conflict
and thus fragile. Weak performance and fragility do not
disappear when a country shows a small improvement in
performance scores that might move it slightly above a
cutoff point. Higher-income or higher-performing countries in vulnerable post-conflict or political transition
situations, as well as countries with fragile areas that
could have spillover effects on neighboring countries,
also require particular types of engagement.

ADB takes a selective approach to WPCs: it will
generally support a limited number of major reforms
to extend the benefits of development, and augment
capacity so as to strengthen ownership and the ability to absorb and manage assistance, for more effective development. Thus, in these countries, ADB will
increase technical assistance and other grant-funded
operations, and strengthen partnerships, including
cofinancing opportunities. In parallel, ADB will keep
refining its approach to identifying weak performance,
rethinking its operational planning, and adapting its
business processes and instruments to suit the needs
and capabilities of individual WPCs.

ADB intends to further strengthen its operations in
WPCs by increasing coordination, mutual learning, and
networking with partners through the newly established
WPC committee and a WPC focal point. ADB’s work
program and budget framework for 2008-2010 indi
ADB will strengthen its
operations in weakly
performing countries by

cates that ADB will step up the use of grant resources,
including those from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, for WPCs, and allocate 20% more technical assistance to these countries than in 2004-2006.

IMPROVING INSTITUTIONAL
EFFICIENCY

Review of Technical Assistance
Management

The comprehensive review of ADB technical assistance
(TA) operations proceeded, with a view to increasing
their development effectiveness.

While developing member countries generally
appreciate ADB’s TA, the special evaluation study of
the Operations Evaluation Department on TA performance concluded that only about two thirds of ADB’s
TA activities have been successful. This is below the
70% success rate target established under the poverty
reduction strategy, indicating considerable room for
improvement in development effectiveness.

The ongoing review has systematically covered
strategy, planning, quality, implementation, ownership, and financial management issues. The proposed
reforms combine product and procedural changes and
pay particular attention to defining responsibility and
accountability for decisions and outcomes at various
steps, shifting decision-making responsibility (and
accountability for the results of the decision) to the
lowest appropriate level, while clarifying the type of
oversight that higher levels in the organization should
provide. The review is expected to be completed
in 2008.

The TA reforms also present an opportunity to
tackle some concerns related to TA financial management. In recent years, TA financing has increasingly
been sourced from externally funded trust funds. While
more diversified funding has allowed ADB to maintain
a sizable and stable program in the face of fluctuating
financial flows, overreliance on trust funds also carries
some risks. First, the objectives of the suppliers of funds
may not match ADB’s or the region’s priorities. Second,
ADB staff and developing member countries can incur
substantial transaction costs in aligning to different
guidelines, procedures, and reporting requirements.

ADB has responded to these trends through a
financing partnership approach, with the creation of
facilities to support broad themes that address the priorities of ADB and the Asia and Pacific region. So far,
such facilities have been established for water (November 2006), regional cooperation (February 2007), and
clean energy (April 2007). By the end of 2007, over
$85 million had been mobilized, $40 million of thisAnnual Report 2007

from ADB’s resources. ADB will also try to harmonize
guidelines across funds and encourage contributors
to bilateral trust funds to merge their funds with the
broader facilities as far as possible.

Strengthening Resident Mission Operations

ADB started to review its resident mission operations
in 2007, to assess the extent to which the objectives
and expectations of the 2000 resident mission policy
are being achieved, to identify issues and constraints on
effective implementation, and to find ways of resolving them. The ongoing review is also looking into
recent changes in ADB’s strategic and operational context, and assessing how these changes have affected or
might affect resident mission operations. The ultimate
objective of the exercise is to come up with short- and
medium-term options for improving resident mission
operations. The review also draws on the findings of the
Operations Evaluation Department’s Special Evaluation
Study on Resident Mission Policy and Related Operations: Delivering Services to Clients, which included
extensive survey work.

The preliminary findings of this review show that
resident mission activities have significantly expanded
to meet the broad objectives of the 2000 resident mission policy (Table 2). Evidence from various sources
suggests that delegation to resident missions has had
a positive impact on ADB operations. To sustain and
amplify the encouraging results, the Strategy and
Policy Department will recommend ways to further
strengthen the implementation of the policy over the
short to medium term. The final paper on the review is
expected to be completed by the first half of 2008.

Innovation and Efficiency Initiative

ADB continued to implement the innovation and efficiency initiative, which is aimed at improving ADB’s business model and aligning services, products, and practices
more closely with client priorities and market trends.

Cost sharing and eligibility of expenditures. New country cost-sharing ceilings and financing parameters for
13 developing member countries have been agreed on
and approved. In most cases, the new portfolio ceilings
(which define the share of project cost that ADB can
finance) are higher than the old project ceilings. Depending on the project and the sector, the new ceilings can

This multitranche financing facility (MFF) supports
a program to bring economic growth to the rural
communities of Assam, Orissa, and West Bengal.
All-weather roads are to be built to give people
better access to markets and social services. The
total cost of the investment program is estimated
at $2.1 billion. ADB has agreed to make available
up to $750.0 million in several tranches over 5 years.

Advance action was allowed with the first MFF
financing request and, in accordance with the new
policy on eligibility of cost sharing and expenditures, retroactive financing was permitted for
contracts awarded as early as 12 months before
loan signing. This allows the executing agency to
contract services and goods well before the first
loan is signed. The size of the financing request can
then be based on the volume of contracts already
awarded. This MFF was approved in December
2005. In 2006, contracts worth about $172.0 million
were awarded, and the first loan for $180.0 million
was signed in August and took effect in October.
The entire amount of the loan has been contracted
out and $110.4 million, or close to 61.3% of the loan
amount, has been disbursed.

New financing instruments and modes. Among the

approved. Flexibility, lower costs, and a programmatic
approach under a partnership agreement are all attractive features of the MFF.

Several of these facilities have been performing
well in terms of contract awards and disbursements.
In view of the large volume of MFFs that have been
approved or are in the pipeline, the incorporation of
this pilot instrument into ADB’s operational tool kit by
the first half of 2008 is being proposed.

With respect to the other instruments, as of the
end of 2007, five nonsovereign public sector financing facilities had been processed (all of them corporate
loans to state-owned enterprises), and one transaction was being considered under the refinancing facility. While ADB expects few proposals for refinancing
transactions, the facility is still useful where public
interest is involved or where demonstration projects
are needed to establish a precedent in the market.
Local-currency loan products were made available to
five countries—the People’s Republic of China, India,
Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and the Philippines—with a
total of 13 loans (all of them for the private sector)
worth $779.5 million approved. By extending or guaranteeing long-term local-currency loans, ADB can
play an important role in selected developing member
countries in ensuring the sustainability of companies
and projects, particularly those that generate revenues
only in local currency.

Country strategies and business processes. For the
effective implementation of ADB’s new business
processes in preparing country partnership strategies
(CPSs), Management approved on 21 February the
revised Operations Manual section on CPSs and the
new CPS guidelines, which emphasize results orientation, selectivity, and the participation of governments,
the private sector, and civil society. Two workshops
were held in September to familiarize staff with the
new guidelines.

Safeguard Policy Update

The Operations Evaluation Department 2006 studies
on the three safeguard policies (environment, indigenous people, and involuntary resettlement) highlighted
the need to improve safeguard implementation, clarify
policy principles, streamline procedures, and better
align ADB’s safeguard requirements with those of its
developing member countries. The ongoing safeguard
policy update is aimed at making ADB’s safeguard policies more effective and more relevant to changing client needs. In particular, the policy update will include
clearer, more coherent, and more consistent safeguard
requirements; a better balance between a front-loaded
approach and attention to the delivery of results during21

 

Experience in managing for development results was shared at the Shanghai International Program for Development Evaluation Training

project implementation; safeguard practices that are
more in harmony with those of other multilateral
financial institutions, and approaches tailored to the
varying safeguard systems and implementation capacities of ADB’s developing member countries; safeguard
policies that are more adaptable to new lending modes
and instruments; and improved internal processes and
resource allocation. An overarching safeguard policy
statement covering the three safeguard policies is
expected to be presented for Board consideration in
the fourth quarter of 2008.

The public communications policy, adopted in April
2005, has increased ADB’s accountability and transparency. The policy commits the institution to proac

tively making information available and to responding
to ad hoc requests for information. ADB has taken a
firm stand in favor of disclosure. The information on
ADB.-assisted projects that is disclosed on the ADB
website has increased continuously since the policy
was adopted (from an average of 73 documents posted
monthly in 2005, after the policy took effect, to 86 in
2006 and 104 in 2007). The public disclosure advisory
committee has so far received no complaints or petitions to review denied requests.

A significantly greater number of project summaries have been posted on the ADB website. Compliance
with the circulation of documents, including social and
environmental information, to the Board continues to
be high but could be more timely. Project appraisal
reports of private sector operations are disclosed after
confidential information is excised, in a significant step
toward increased transparency. The minutes of all ADB
Board meetings and the chair’s summaries of Board
discussions on ADB policies and strategies are posted
on the ADB website. Country partnership and regional
cooperation strategies are also circulated in draft form
to increase country ownership. ADB’s core administrative documents, such as the budget, are posted online.

ADB, along with 30 other organizations, was
recently assessed in 2007 Global Accountability Report,
published by One World Trust, and received a perfect (100%) score for good practice in transparency
because of its public communications policy.Financing

In 2007, Australia, Norway, and the Netherlands
committed a total of $56.5 million to the innovative
Water Financing Partnership Facility, or more than
50% of the original target of $100.0 million by the
end of 2008. ADB started to manage the Asia Pacific
Carbon Fund to acquire future flows of certified emission reduction credits on behalf of participants, in
return for up-front cofinancing payments. By the end
of 2007, a total of $151.8 million had been remitted
to this fund through Instruments of Contributions
from Belgium, Finland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain,
Sweden, and Climate Cent Foundation. Two new
facilities were established: the Clean Energy Financing
Partnership Facility, with contributions of $5.9 million
from Australia and $5.6 million from Norway; and the
Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility.

ADB agreed with Japan on a strategic partnership called Enhanced Sustainable Development in
Asia (ESDA) to improve investment climates, including regional cooperation and energy efficiency, in
Asia. Under the ESDA framework, the Japan Bank
for International Cooperation, through the Accelerated Co-Financing scheme with ADB (ACFA), agreed
to provide concessional yen loans for an aggregate $1
billion—$2 billion over the next 5 years to jointly cofinance ADB projects. Japan also established two trust
funds linked to the new financing partnership facilities: the Asian Clean Energy Fund and the Investment

RESOURCE TRANSFERS

The year showed significant improvement in disbursement, compared with the past 10 years. In discussions
with borrowers, countries highlighted the need for ADB
to expand support for poverty reduction programs. The
Board discussed a range of new financial mechanisms
and business procedure reforms under the innovation
and efficiency initiative to respond to client demands.

During the year, there was a net transfer of
resources of $3.2 billion from ADB to its developing member countries, compared with $2.2 billion
in 2006. Of these net resource transfers, $2.4 billion
went to OCR borrowers and investors in 2007, and
$1.5 billion went to them in 2006. The four countries
with largest net resource transfers were India, the PRC,
Pakistan, and Indonesia.

Loan disbursements totaled $6.8 billion compared
with $5.7 billion in 2006. Of the total, OCR disbursements were $5.2 billion or 76%, and ADF disbursements were $1.6 billion or 24% (Table 9).

Loan service payments totaled $3.6 billion in
2007, about the same level as that in 2006.

NONSOVEREIGN OPERATIONS

ADB approved a total of 27 financial markets and infrastructure nonsovereign projects providing $1.746 billion in assistance in 2007 (Table 11). The interventions
are composed of 19 private sector loans of $760.3 million, 3 public sector loans of $105.0 million, 5 equity
investments of $79.8 million, 4 credit guarantees of
$376.0 million, and $425.0 million in commercial loans
under ADB’s B-loan program, of which $200.0 million
is for a private sector project while $225.0 million is for
a public sector project.

The Board of Directors increased the ceiling for
ADB’s nonsovereign operations to $5.0 billion. As of
31 December, the overall exposure of nonsovereign
operations amounted to about $3.0 billion, consisting
of loans of $1.5 billion, $1.1 billion in equity investments, and guarantees of $530.7 million. ADB’s nonsovereign exposure is largest in the infrastructure sector
with a total of $1.4 billion, followed by exposure to
the financial sector of $1.1 billion, investment funds
and capital markets of $486.3 million, and exposure
to other sectors at $89.8 million.

Cumulative nonsovereign operations are largest in
India (18%), followed by the PRC (17%), Indonesia
(11%), and Pakistan (9%). Regional projects account
for roughly 11% of the total (Table 10).

SNOILVY3AdO ONIDNVNISThrough operations, knowledge, and

partnerships, ADB helps reduce poverty,

social exclusion, and vulnerability, and makes
growth more inclusive. In 2007, 27% of ADB’s
sovereign loans (20% of loan investments)

and 18% of all technical assistance (TA)
projects (14% of TA resources) were “targeted
interventions.”29

 

Of sovereign lending, about 17% supported inclusive
social development and 11% supported gender as
strategic development goals. The 2006 Annual Poverty
Reduction Report states that ADB improved its implementation of the poverty reduction strategy. In developing the new long-term strategic framework, ADB
prepared various reports on inclusive growth and inequality. An international conference, Poverty Reduction and Inclusive Growth in the New Asia and Pacific,
recommended better alignment of inclusive growth
with ADB’s operational activities and internal capabilities. The new poverty website features a database
with more than 800 ADB-specific documents and operational reports published in the last 3 years.

Supporting the Millennium
Development Goals

In partnership with the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) and the UN Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP),
ADB published the Millennium Development Goals
update report, and organized regional conferences on
Millennium Development Goals in Central Asia and
Southeast Asia.

Strengthening Poverty and Social Analysis

ADB updated its policy on incorporating social dimensions into ADB operations, revised the templates for
poverty and social impact analysis for ADB-assisted
projects, and prepared a new Handbook on Social Analysis. Together with the Poverty Handbook published in
2006, these instruments are expected to make ADBassisted activities in developing member countries more
effective and inclusive. Staff members were trained to
use these tools.

Making Social Services More Inclusive

ADB prepared an issues paper on social protection,
developed a social protection index for 23 countries
in the Asia and Pacific region, and supported various social protection—-related technical assistance and

tion), Indonesia (as part of programmatic lending for
the Millennium Development Goals), Pakistan (pension reform), Viet Nam (agriculture insurance), and
elsewhere. In Nepal, an innovative mechanism for
transferring cash and in-kind support to scheduledcaste households is being tested along with an Asian
Development Fund-financed project involving gender
equality and women’s empowerment. In Viet Nam, a
small technical assistance helped develop a mechanism
for channeling earmarked resources from hydropower
generation to affected communities.

Gender and Development Plan
of Action

The second gender and development plan of action
(2008-2010) recommends increasing the number of
loans that directly reduce gender disparities, diversify
the sector and geographic coverage of projects that
explicitly bring gender into the development mainstream, and improve the implementation of genderrelated project design features and policy dialogue on
emerging issues such as climate change, human trafficking, and communicable diseases.

REGIONAL COOPERATION
AND INTEGRATION

ADB continued to implement the regional cooperation
and integration strategy. Progress was steady in Central
and West Asia, East Asia, the Pacific, South Asia, and
Southeast Asia (see the respective chapters for details).

ADB played a leading role in the World Trade
Organization’s Aid for Trade initiative in the Asia and
Pacific region. ADB cohosted the conference Mobilizing Aid for Trade: Focus on Asia and the Pacific, at
ADB headquarters in September, and advocated more
aid for trade for the region.

ADB’s flagship research project dealing with emerging Asian regionalism assesses progress made a decade
after the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis and identifies
challenges facing the region. ADB also conducted a study
on East Asia-South Asia economic relations, which covered the potential benefits of closer integration.

ADB, in collaboration with the Japan International
Cooperation Agency, conducted in Tokyo the first training program in bond market development in Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members, bringing
together officials from 15 central banks and ministries
of finance. ADB also organized the Asia Bond Clearing
and Settlement Conference in April in Singapore, and the
ASEAN+3 (ASEAN plus the People’s Republic of China
[PRC], Japan, and the Republic of Korea) Investing in
Asia Bonds Conference in November in Tokyo. ADB

The lungs of the Mekong, the waterways of the Tonle Sap must be preserved

advanced the ASEAN+3 Asian Bond Markets Initiative
by helping design a plan to establish a regional credit
guarantee and investment mechanism, and by building
consensus among ASEAN+3 to implement the plan.

Besides promoting environmental protection, clean
energy, and good governance, ADB used resources from
a Swedish cooperation fund to integrate HIV/AIDS
interventions into infrastructure investments. With the
ASEAN Secretariat, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the World Health Organization, and in
consultation with other development partners, ADB
helped developing member countries prevent and control the spread of avian influenza and prepare for a
potential influenza pandemic.

ADB made progress in combating human trafficking, especially in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Two
regional technical assistance projects, started in 2005
and completed in 2007, significantly aided regional
and national research, monitoring actions, training,
and policy dialogues.

The Board of Directors approved the establishment of the Regional Cooperation and Integration
Fund (RCIF) and the RCI Trust Funds under the RCI
Financing Partnership Facility. The facility helps pool
and provide financial and knowledge resources to sup
port RCI. Thirteen projects ($12.6 million total) were
approved for funding under the RCIF.

MANAGING THE ENVIRONMENT

ADB continued to promote environmentally sustainable development. ADB integrated environmental and
social safeguards into projects, strengthened the legal
and institutional frameworks of developing member
countries (DMCs), supported environmental and natural resource management interventions, promoted
interventions to address global and regional environmental issues, and bolstered partnerships.

To ensure compliance with safeguards for 86 projects before Board approval, ADB reviewed the safeguard
plans and frameworks for the projects (64 on the environment, 41 on involuntary resettlement, and 25 on
indigenous peoples). Training courses were organized for
staff and DMCs to increase awareness of safeguards, and
nine reports were published on resettlement risk management. ADB also engaged nongovernment organizations
(NGOs) and other development partners in improving
safeguard outcomes.

Technical assistance projects were approved to
enhance Viet Nam’s legal framework for involuntaryAnnual Report 2007

resettlement and to improve the capacity of the resident
missions and of government in Indonesia, Pakistan, and
Viet Nam to see to it that safeguards are complied with.

ADB supported the initiatives of DMCs to conserve environmental and natural resources. Of the
82 projects (excluding equity investments) approved,
15 (18%) had environmental sustainability as theme.
Half of the $909 million for these environmental and
resource conservation projects will improve water supply, wastewater and solid waste management systems,
and heating, transport, and flood control services in
the PRC and Indonesia. The rest will promote cleaner
production through the installation of wind power
plants in India and a combined cycle gas-fired power
plant in Pakistan, and natural resource conservation in
Indonesia, the Kyrgyz Republic, and the Philippines.

Environmental sustainability is also the theme of
nearly 60 approved technical assistance project grants
($80 million). Some of these will promote clean energy
in the PRC, India, and Viet Nam, and natural resource
conservation in Indonesia, Lao People’s Democratic
Republic, and Sri Lanka.

To mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and
help DMCs adapt to climate change, ADB continued
its clean energy and environment programs. Its energy
efficiency, carbon market, and sustainable transport
initiatives provided access to new investment financing mechanisms, and built capacity for energy efficiency
improvements, renewable energy, waste-to-energy, sustainable transport, and other GHG mitigation projects. A regional technical assistance was also approved
to include adaptation issues in investment planning,
develop national capacity, and strengthen international
response to adaptation.

ADB published reports on urban air quality management in Asia covering 17 countries and one city,
and maintained the Poverty Environment.Net website,
which shares knowledge about incorporating environmental issues into the mainstream of development.

ADB continued to work with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) on policy and other corporate
matters, and prepared projects for GEF endorsement.
It established the Clean Air Initiative Asia Center and
implemented the Poverty and Environment Program;

ADB supported the initiatives
of developing member
countries to conserve
environmental and natural
resources

it also helped the partners of the Central Asian Countries Initiative for Land Management adapt to future
climate changes in the arid region. Support for the
Asian Environmental Compliance and Enforcement
Network was renewed.

IMPROVING GOVERNANCE AND
PREVENTING CORRUPTION

Seventeen of 82 approved sovereign and nonsovereign
loan projects and 68 out of 242 technical assistance
projects were aimed at strengthening governance. Over
$3 billion in assistance was provided to governance
projects, including a good governance program in
Bangladesh, a local government financing and budget
reform program in the Philippines, and the strengthening of performance audit in the PRC.

ADB’s five regional departments made good progress in implementing the second governance and anticorruption action plan. Governance risk assessments
have been undertaken in 14 developing member countries in preparation for the drafting of country partnership strategies; 30 national, subnational, and sector
assessments were completed or near completion at the
end of 2007.

ADB supported regional efforts to ratify and implement the United Nations Convention Against Corruption
and the approaches to governance assessments developed
by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD)-Development Assistance Committee Governance Network. The ADB-OECD AntiCorruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific continues
to be useful. Regional seminars on conflict of interest,
mutual legal assistance and asset recovery, and ways to
combat bribery in public procurement were conducted.

The capacity development medium-term framework and action plan, approved in 2007, guides ADB
in engaging client countries in developing capacities
critical for sustainable and equitable development.
The extensive study of capacity development in the
Pacific produced a framework and a set of guidance
notes and checklists.

ADB revised its project implementation and administration manuals to further streamline and harmonize
procedures on procurement and consultant recruitment.

Executing agencies continued to assess their capacity
to evaluate project risks that may hinder effective, efficient,
and transparent procurement. Procurement risk assessments were introduced into the preparation of country
partnership strategies and will be expanded in 2008.

ADB’s NGO and Civil Society Center approved
$150,000 in small grants to NGOs in Mongolia, Pakistan,
and the Philippines to pilot-test models that strengthen
civil society’s voice in promoting good governance.

The Central and West Asia Department
consolidated and expanded operations.
Sixteen sovereign loan, eight nonsovereign
loan, and twelve grant projects totaling

$3.0 billion were approved for nine countries
(Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan,
Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan). The total was
twice the annual average of $1.5 billion in
2002-2006.About 66% of sovereign approvals (70% including nonsovereign approvals) involved ordinary capital resources (OCR), and the other 34% (30% including nonsovereign approvals)
were Asian Development Fund (ADF) loans and grants. ADF grants totaled $247.4 million
(Table 13). Lending operations started in Armenia in the transport and water supply sectors.
The transport, finance, and energy sectors have the biggest share of the program.

Pakistan continued to be the main client, with six sovereign loan projects and one nonsovereign loan project valued in total at $2.0 billion. Lending to Pakistan targeted greater
inclusiveness and access to financial services, policy reforms for capital market development,
and improved government efficiency. Lending was also directed at providing $400 million
in long-term investment financing to clear bottlenecks in transport and to support energy,
irrigation, and earthquake rehabilitation projects.

Two multitranche financing facilities (MFFs) for $1.4 billion were approved: one for the
Azerbaijan road network development and another for the Pakistan trade corridor highway
program (Table 12). The second tranche of a Pakistan power transmission MFF was also
approved. These projects represented ADB’s continuing effort to adopt a programmatic
approach to doing business.CENTRAL AND WEST ASIA

Nonsovereign operations reached record levels in
2007, in line with the transition of the subregion to
a market economy and efforts to develop the private
sector. ADB’s nonsovereign approvals in the region
totaled $642.8 million (Statistical Annex 10).

Georgia joined ADB, and an interim operational
strategy was prepared for the country. For the Kyrgyz
Republic, ADB and four other development partners—
the Department for International Development of the
United Kingdom, Swiss Cooperation, United Nations
agencies, and the World Bank Group—drew up a joint
country support strategy. Country partnership strategies were prepared for Afghanistan and Pakistan.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

ADB spent much time and resources managing its
129 ongoing loan projects in the region. A hugely important “spring cleaning” exercise in Pakistan resulted in

disbursements ($1.2 billion, or 120%), and “projects at
risk,” at 5%, were at an all-time low. ADB redoubled
its efforts to close overdue technical assistance projects
in close coordination with project consultants and the
Controllers Department. Teams communicated constantly with consultants and firms, setting deadlines to
conclude pending financial transactions.

Innovations were introduced to improve portfolio
management. These included early warning systems
(i.e., implementation issues anticipated, given past performance and the changing environment); a new policy
of not extending loans or technical assistance automatically, especially to those with no chance of meeting

targets on time and within budget; a division workload audit to clarify accountabilities and responsibilities, maintain transparency, and plan the delegation of
projects to resident missions; and a joint venture of
headquarters and resident missions that builds on the
synergy between sector expertise and local knowledge
for effective loan supervision.

Azerbaijan

Partnership priorities. ADB significantly increased its
private sector operations in the country.

ADB was active in transport sector development.
A $500 million multitranche financing facility for the
road network development program marked a new
milestone in ADB-Azerbaijan cooperation.

Impact of operations. The ongoing flood mitigation
project greatly helped the Government manage recurring floods in the main flood-prone areas, which are
inhabited mostly by the poor, providing protection to
5 major towns and 43 villages and supporting the livelihood of about 215,000 people.

Georgia

Partnership priorities. The interim operational strategy
was prepared for presentation to the Board in the first
quarter of 2008. Likely areas of ADB assistance are
municipal infrastructure services, highway network
development, energy infrastructure upgrading and
development, and private sector development.

Kazakhstan

Partnership priorities. Assistance was extended to private
sector development, environmentally sustainable development, and regional cooperation. Private sector operations,
which started in 2006, continued to be the core of ADB
strategy, complemented by public sector lending programs in rural water supply, irrigation, and transport.

Impact of operations. ADB loans supported water
resource management, rural water supply and sanitation, road rehabilitation, and the banking sector.

ADB set up an anti-inflation monetary regime
with the National Bank of Kazakhstan. ADB issued
its first tenge (T) bonds in the amount of T6 billion
($50 million), becoming the first supranational issuer
of such bonds. The proceeds will be used to develop
small and medium-sized enterprises. ADB also helped
the Government improve rural living and health conditions through a $34.6 million loan for basic water
supply services and capacity building.

Kyrgyz Republic

Partnership priorities. Under their just-approved joint
country support strategy, ADB and other development partners will support the country’s development
strategy (2007-2010) with $100 million in ADB assistance to promote environmental sustainability, private
sector development, and regional cooperation.

Impact of operations. Overall, ADB’s sectoral and
thematic focus was in line with the priorities set in the
national poverty reduction strategy. ADB’s portfolio
performance was satisfactory, with a success rate of
95%. Regional road development was a major part
of ADB activities, and improved domestic transport
connectivity benefiting the country significantly. Most
recently, the Almaty—Bishkek road was completed.

More than Infrastructure

 

 

Asylbek Kalimbetov says driving is easier now

For the Kyrgyz Republic, a vibrant Central Asian
country of 5 million, the road linking the capital city
of Bishkek to the neighboring capital of Almaty in
Kazakhstan is much more than infrastructure. Every day
thousands of people and vehicles cross the AkzholChu border to trade goods, do business, and visit
friends. Since 1998, the volume of traffic on this road
has increased by 25% even as exports from the Kyrgyz
Republic to Kazakhstan have gone up 160%. The inclusion of this road in the Transport and Trade Facilitation
Strategy endorsed at the 6th Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Ministerial Conference underlined
its importance as a regional transport corridor.

Six days a week for the past 7 years, 47-year-old
Asylbek Kalimbetov of Bishkek has worked as a taxi
driver, driving clients to Almaty in his car. The recently
completed Almaty-Bishkek Road Rehabilitation
Project improved 245 km of road—and Asylbek’s livelihood. “Driving has definitely become easier,” he says.
“Each trip used to take me 4 or 5 hours. Now it takes
only 2 or 3.1 can return home by nightfall.”

help connect Osh to Kashgar in the People’s Republic
of China (PRC), and Dushanbe in Tajikistan.

Pakistan

Partnership priorities. ADB promoted sustained,
inclusive, and private sector-led economic growth
to create jobs and reduce poverty. Key priority areas
were second-generation reforms to improve competitiveness, governance, and financial services; the
development of the urban and the rural economies
in support of inclusive growth and balanced development; reforms and investment in major infrastructure
sectors; and implementation for development effectiveness and results.

Asylbek is also saving on his car’s maintenance.
The chassis or shock absorbers used to need repair
every month or so; now he goes to the shop only
twice a year. “| can’t complain about the road or the
road workers,” Asylbek says. “The road authorities do
a good job. When the road gets icy they spread sand
over the dangerous sections to make them less slippery.” In his 7 years as a taxi driver, Asylbek has earned
enough to buy a second car and a plot of land, and to
send his children to school.

The people of the Lake Issyk-Kul region, a magnificent tourism destination in the heart of Central
Asia, have also benefited. A million tourists now come,
most of them from Kazakhstan. This is 50% more than
the number of visitors in 2005. Jobs are plentiful, not
just in the hospitality service sector. There have been
major developments as well in accommodations,
toads, camping sites, and banking. Tourism contributed 4.3% to the Kyrgyz Republic’s gross domestic
product in 2006, up from 2.9 % in 2001. “There are
more tourists from Kazakhstan because the IssykKul hotels and resorts provide better services,” Esen
Arykbaev, director of Goluboi Issyk-Kul health resort,
points out. “And since the Almaty-Bishkek road was
rebuilt, travel time has been reduced.”

Every day thousands of
people and vehicles cross
the Akzhol-Chu border to
trade goods, do business,
and visit friends

ADB strengthened aid effectiveness by leading a
capacity-building working group established by the
Government and by supporting the harmonization and
alignment of approaches to development assistance. A
new country partnership strategy was being prepared
for Board consideration in 2008 to further strengthen
ADB’s long-standing development partnership with
Pakistan.

Impact of operations. Disbursements were a record
$990.5 million and contract awards $1.1 billion, with
about 95% of the loans expected to either exceed or
meet most of their development objectives. The Second
Science Education Project, completed in June, improved
access to secondary school science and mathematics

facilities, especially for girls. A women’s health project,
completed in October, gave women and children better access to health workers, supported the vaccination
of women of reproductive age, and improved physical
and other facilities for maternal and child health.

The flood protection sector project was supported
to improve policy and build capacity to plan, design,
and implement flood protection works, and improve
flood forecasting, warning, and preparedness systems.
The Access to Justice Program, completed in August,
engaged civil society in improving justice delivery,
strengthening public oversight over the police, and
establishing specialized and independent prosecution
services.

Tajikistan

Partnership priorities. ADB assistance emphasized
rural development and regional cooperation, as well
as policy reforms in the agriculture, energy, transport,
and social sectors.

Impact of operations. ADB was intensively involved in
the road sector, with a transport portfolio consisting
of three ongoing loans to rehabilitate the Dushanbe—
Kyrgyz Border-PRC road corridor, the recently completed Dushanbe-Kurgan—Tyube—Dangara—Kulyab road
rehabilitation project, and a number of technical assistance projects.

Two major loans for agriculture rehabilitation and
irrigation rehabilitation projects helped improve irrigation efficiency, enterprise returns, and livelihood. ADB
continued to do a significant amount of work on the
cotton farm debt issue, including the preparation of the
proposed Agri-Cotton Sector Restructuring Program.

Turkmenistan

Partnership priorities. In November, a seminar on
ADB operational policies and procedures was held in
Ashgabat to familiarize government officials with
ADB’s country strategy and modes of assistance, project
processing and implementation, experience in infrastructure development, and contribution to regional
cooperation. Consultations on the development priorities of the Government, and ADB’s potential role and
assistance in programs and projects, continued.

ADB kept up its support for energy sector development by organizing the first technical meeting on the
proposed Turkmenistan—Afghanistan—Pakistan-India
Gas Pipeline in Ashgabat in April. ADB also provided
regional technical assistance for environmental protection and rural development.

Impact of operations. ADB has not had any lending
operations in Turkmenistan.

Uzbekistan

Partnership priorities. The country strategy and program for 2006-2010 defines the four key areas of
ADB’s assistance: rural development, promotion of

private sector development, regional cooperation in
transport and trade, and improved social services with

emphasis on early childhood development and basic
education.

The ninth country portfolio review—jointly undertaken by ADB, the World Bank, and the Government—identified systemic portfolio performance issues
and corrective measures to improve individual project
implementation and broader portfolio performance.

Impact of operations. ADB was the largest funder of
education in Uzbekistan. Investment of ordinary capital
resources in education—about 19% of ADB’s total portfolio in the country—supported, among others, sector

 

A house is rebuilt after the earthquake

Mushtaq Ahmed was collecting firewood on the morning of 8 October 2005 when the earth began shaking
around him. Within just a few minutes, the world he
had known for years was shattered. “My wife perished
in the rubble but then almost everybody in the village
lost a dear one. Fora moment, | thought it was the end
of the world,” the 55-year-old recalls.

The earthquake that obliterated Mushtaq’s village
of Lamnia in the lower western ridges of the Himalayas was one of the most debilitating natural disasters
to ever strike Asia. More than 75,000 people perished
and about 3.5 million were left homeless in mountainous terrain spanning 30,000 square kilometers.

Given the scale of the disaster—and with a brutal Himalayan winter fast approaching—the Government appealed for immediate help in a bid to avert
even more loss of life.

Responding to the challenge, ADB pledged $1 billion for reconstruction and rehabilitation. To date, ADB
has committed about $740.0 million in Asian Development Fund loans and grants, while leveraging another
$180 million in the form of bilateral grant funds for the
ADB-funded Pakistan Earthquake Fund and through
cofinancing.

reforms, rehabilitation of schools, curriculum development, introduction of modern information technology,
provision of textbooks, and training of teachers.

Under the successfully completed Railway Modernization Project, 341 kilometers of double-track
railway between Samarkand and Bukhara were rehabilitated, and modern track and telecommunications
equipment was provided. This, together with ADB’s
first railway project, led to the development of a fasttrain service from Tashkent to Samarkand and from
there to Bukhara, improving transport connectivity for
both people and cargo.

“We mobilized support swiftly, assembling a dedicated team which has since been working with the
Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority and counterpart regional and provincial bodies to
assess the extent of damage, identify priority areas,
and to channel funds for the rehabilitation process,”
says ADB country director Peter Fedon.

To rebuild more than half a million destroyed or
badly damaged rural houses, more than 400,000 rural
grant beneficiaries each received 150,000 Pakistan
rupees (about $2,400). “The decision to let people
take charge and build their own houses has paid off,”
Shaukat Shafi, senior ADB project implementation
officer, says.

ADB has also set aside a total of $163.5 million for
rebuilding more than 1,000 kilometers of roads. To
rehabilitate the power sector, about $9 million worth
of contracts for equipment and civil works have been
awarded and most of the power and grid stations
have now been rebuilt.

Rehabilitation work is also ongoing in education
and health. ADB is investing $110 million to rebuild
454 primary and middle schools. It will provide
another $33.2 million to rebuild hospitals and rural
health centers.

Topping up these efforts, ADB is also supporting
the restoration of government institutions such as the
judiciary and the police, and others that provide special assistance to the earthquake victims.

“The decision to let
people take charge and
build their own houses
has paid off”

VISV LSAM ONY 1VY¥LNADThe People’s Republic of China (PRC) has
emerged as a leading producer of manufactured
exports, with strong growth occurring across a
range of sectors. Mongolia has also experienced
strong growth recently. Both countries are
active in regional cooperation programs.A new country partnership strategy for 2008-2010 was drafted for the PRC in consultation
with the Government. The strategy focuses on resource efficiency and environmental sustainability, inclusive growth and balanced development, regional cooperation, and private
sector development. Knowledge, innovation, and governance support are crosscutting themes.
In Mongolia, ADB’s assistance is directed mainly at private sector-led economic growth
and inclusive social development to achieve the country’s Millennium Development Goals.
Infrastructure projects remain a key component of the program. ADB’s nonsovereign
approvals in the region totaled $534 million (Statistical Annex 10).

The PRC has been active in regional cooperation programs and initiatives, including the
Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program and the Greater Mekong
Subregion (GMS). Demand from the PRC has strengthened economies in the region and
beyond. Regional transport development is a focus of Mongolia’s participation in CAREC.
Mongolia also participates in CAREC’s Coordination Committee on Trade Facilitation to
promote cross-border trade and customs cooperation. Both the PRC and Mongolia have
participated as well in subregional cooperation initiatives to prevent sand and dust storms
and reduce transboundary pollution in Northeast Asia. Technical assistance to the PRC
and Mongolia has helped develop investment regulations, economic development strategies,
competition policy, laws, and standards.

Developing the Carbon Market in the People’s Republic of China

 

 

Residents use clean energy

Carbon emissions trading has become an important
tool for achieving the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol, which took effect in 2005 to ease global warming.
With over 91 million average annual carbon emission
reductions, or 48% of the total registered under the
clean development mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol,
the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has become the
leading supplier in the international carbon market.
The PRC has therefore announced policies, targets,
and measures to promote clean energy technologies,
improve energy efficiency, and conserve resources.

reforms in water supply, sanitation, and waste management. Wastewater management made significant
progress through tariff and enterprise reforms, a
stronger legal and regulatory framework, and better
private sector participation. A key achievement of
ADB’s urban infrastructure projects was corporate
governance reform, particularly in the urban water
and wastewater sector, where private sector participation is increasing.

ADB continued to help the PRC develop clean
and renewable energy supplies through hydropower,
biomass, landfill methane, geothermal, and coal mine
methane (CMM) projects. It is financing a CMM
power plant in Shanxi, the largest in the world. To
tackle the problem of climate change, up-front financing from the ADB-managed Asia Pacific Carbon Fund
for the Erlongshan Hydropower Project—a mediumsized hydropower development in remote, rural Gansu
province—was approved in exchange for future emission reduction credits. Strategic studies on a medium
ADB's assistance to the PRC energy sector is
mainly in the carbon market. The Asia Pacific Carbon
Fund, recently established by ADB under the Carbon
Market Initiative, contracted the purchase of carbon
emission reductions from the Erlongshan Hydropower
Project in Gansu province, with payment to be made
to the project company in advance of clean power
generation. ADB also extended an aggregate of over
$2 million in nonlending assistance to encourage
more clean energy projects. These projects should
improve planning and management of clean
energy development in Gansu, and measuring
and evaluation of energy conservation nationally.
They should also lead to more biomass-based
power generation in Heilongjiang province, the
promotion of shallow ground geothermal energy
technology, and better use of external assistance to
improve energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy in the PRC.

power generation in Heilongjiang were started. A joint
seminar with the Private Sector Operations Department was held in Gansu to showcase ADB’s ability to
promote commercially viable, clean energy projects
through loans and credit enhancement to enterprises
with no need for sovereign guarantees.

Since late 2004, ADB has been providing advisory
technical assistance to the PRC’s State Food and Drug
Administration in cooperation with the World Health
Organization and various stakeholders to improve
national food safety. ADB’s advice to senior officials
on a range of technical and policy issues was well
received. In August, the State Council formed a leading group to look into product quality and food safety;
and in October, it endorsed a draft food safety law that
substantially departs from earlier legislation to provide
a comprehensive, overarching legal framework.

Tsogt Batsukh and aimag officials

Approved in 2000, the Agriculture Sector Development Program was designed to spur growth in private agriculture. A $7 million program loan was aimed
at limiting the role of the Government to providing
essential support services and enabling the private
sector to take over functions that used to be carried out
by the state, such as supplying inputs, processing and
marketing outputs, and providing financial services.
An investment loan of $10 million was directed at
four relatively poor provinces in the country’s western
region. The results were positive and dramatic. Over
7,900 vegetable growers benefited from the seed and
equipment supplied by the program.

ADB started to prepare its country partnership strategy for 2009-2013. The strategy will be closely aligned
with the National Development Strategy of Mongolia for 2008-2021, which the Parliament approved in
February 2008 and which emphasizes the achievement
of Mongolia’s Millennium Development Goals. ADB
approved technical assistance to help improve government investment planning.

Impact of operations. Overall, ADB’s program contributed significantly to Mongolia’s transition. Since 2000,
poverty reduction has been the primary focus. The program has had important impact on policy development,

Six years ago, Tsogt Batsukh was jobless and his
family of five had to survive on social security payments.
He decided to establish the Uran Zurvas cooperative
with nine members in November 1999. The cooperative grew potatoes, vegetables, and fodder crops.

In 2002, the program started in Uvs aimag (province), and Mr. Batsukh attended a training course on
developing a business plan. With equipment and
credit supplied through commercial banks, Mr. Batsukh and the other cooperative members harvested
bumper crops of vegetables. By 2004, the cooperative
members totaled 53 and the program had created 35
new jobs for low-income people. Mr. Batsukh now also
manages a cooperative training center and runs demonstration training for locals who want to learn how to
grow vegetables. Further support from the program
and a commercial bank enabled the cooperative to
establish a vegetable-processing factory, which now
supplies the market in Uvs. Mr. Batsukh says he owes
his success to the program.

Over 7,900 vegetable

institution building, and economic growth, laying the
foundation for a sustained effort to reduce poverty.

Since 1997, ADB has helped Mongolia reform its
health system, which needs an overhaul of the hospital
sector, primary health care, financing systems, human
resources and planning, and regulatory processes.
ADB has cooperated closely with the Government in
identifying and implementing reform priorities, and in
upgrading health service infrastructure in mainly poor
rural areas. The result has been significantly improved
health, including reduced infant mortality and maternal mortality rates, helping attain the Millennium
Development Goals.

ADB?’s traditional role in the Pacific has
been that of a project bank, providing
lending and grant support to the 14 Pacific

developing member countries for key projects
in transport, power, water and sewerage,
education, health, and public administration.
In its newer and growing role in the region,
ADB has supported capacity building, public
policy analysis and reform, and improved
development processes.For ADB in the Pacific, 2007 proved to be the strongest year yet in terms of the value of
lending, grants, and cofinancing received. Loans totaling $126.6 million and grants of $46.5
million were approved (Tables 22, 23, and 25). Cumulative lending for the region amounted
to $1.8 billion (Table 26). ADB loans, grants, and technical assistance to the Pacific drew
$82.5 million in cofinancing, up $40.4 million over 2006, continuing the trend of increasing
levels of cofinancing.

New and innovative modes of assistance have allowed ADB to respond more quickly
and flexibly to identified country needs and in partnership with other development partners.
ADB stepped up its support to the Papua New Guinea transport sector: in its largest combined loan to the country so far, it approved $100.0 million in loans with grant financing of
$2.3 million from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and the HIV/AIDS fund for the Lae
Port Development Project. ADB also pioneered a new instrument of engagement in a loan
buy-down mechanism in Samoa. The mechanism was combined with approval of an Asian
Development Fund (ADF) loan of $26.6 million and an ADF grant of $15.4 million for the
Samoa Power Sector Expansion Project, which is cofinanced by the Japan Bank of International Cooperation (with a $38.0 million loan) and the Government of Australia (with an
$8.0 million grant) (Tables 23 and 25). ADB continued its strong emphasis on facilitating
private sector development in the Pacific. The $8.7 million private sector development initiative, cofinanced by Australia, was launched in early 2007 and has already provided focused
and practical support in the core areas of state-owned enterprise reform and public-private
partnerships; financial sector reform; and reform of the institutional, legal, and regulatory
business environments.PACIFIC

Highlights

* Emphasized new modes of assistance
(community-based modes of procurement, a
performance-based loan buy-down scheme,
and grants)

* Deepened donor coordination of strategies,
programs, and projects, which catalyzed a large
increase in cofinancing and promoted harmonization and alignment

* Strengthened the Pacific program after
the midterm review of the Pacific strategy
(2005-2009) and the development of the first
Pacific country partnership strategy (Tonga
[2008-2012])

* Focused on capacity development through
an in-depth assessment of the region’s experience, which guided the redesign of internal
processes and the development of new technical assistance approaches

* Supported regional cooperation through a
regional operations business plan to strengthen
national ownership of regional approaches,
facilitate regional provision of services,
and improve the environment for private
sector development

ADB’s contribution to the understanding of Pacific
issues has been strengthened through increased attention to economic and social analyses. An in-depth
assessment of capacity development experiences in
the Pacific has created an important guide for future
assistance. Oceanic Voyages: Aviation and Shipping in
the Pacific Region, published in 2007, is expected to
contribute to the reform of public sector operations

Pacific Islands Economic Reports, publishing a report
on Tuvalu and presenting draft reports to partner governments in the Cook Islands, Nauru, Palau, Papua
New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga. Private sector assessments for Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga
helped elevate policy dialogue on private sector development issues and solutions, and led to agreements
on the implementation of specific reform activities.
ADB is supporting an analysis of household income
and expenditure surveys and poverty throughout the
region. Regional technical assistance is being provided to support demographic and health survey work
in the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Solomon Islands,
and Tuvalu.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

Actual performance against targets was more than
98% for disbursements ($50.3 million) and 111%
for contract awards ($50.9 million) (Table 24). Papua
New Guinea contributed 76% of contract awards and
55% of disbursements, and the Fiji Islands 11% and
25%. The number of active technical assistance (TA)
projects has averaged 88 over the past 3 years. TA savings amounted to $1.3 million in 2007. A cumulative
total of 16 loan and grant projects and 42 TA activities have been delegated to the resident missions. This
contributes to effective monitoring and strengthened
partnerships with developing member countries and
development partners. It also facilitates greater ADB
engagement in policy dialogue at the national and
regional levels.Annual Report 2008 53

COUNTRY HIGHLIGHTS

Cook Islands

Partnership priorities. The approved country operations business plan (2007-2009) builds on past assistance for infrastructure and fiscal management to
help sustain private sector—-driven growth. ADB’s
priorities are to develop environmentally sound infrastructure and to improve the governance framework
for infrastructure.

Impact of operations. The Pacific Islands Economic
Report for Cook Islands was finalized, analyzing
economic conditions, development constraints, and
opportunities, in support of the preparation of the
country partnership strategy for 2008-2012.

Fiji Islands

Partnership priorities. After Management approval of
the Fiji Islands: Reengagement Approach on 5 April,
ADB resumed its previously approved activities. ADB
constantly monitored conditions, focusing on poverty
conditions, and the engagement or endorsement of the
interim government by international organizations and
ADB’s shareholding countries.

Impact of operations. ADB’s engagement was limited
to activities under the ongoing program involving road
development and rehabilitation, water and sanitation,
energy, economic reform, and private sector development. In late 2007, ADB supported harmonized economic sector work associated with an International
Monetary Fund Article IV Consultation.Annual Report 2008

Stopping HIV from reaching rural people

At least 8 out of 10 people in Papua New Guinea live
in rural areas but are excluded from HIV/AIDS programs because villages are remote and inaccessible,
rural health services have collapsed, and certain cultural practices remain deeply ingrained. Rural industries tend to give rise to an environment conducive to
high-risk behavior in surrounding areas.

2006 for HIV/AIDS prevention and control aims to
change that. The grant—for $22 million inclusive of
$7 million cofinancing—is helping stop HIV/AIDS
from reaching rural populations in Papua New Guinea
by integrating the management capabilities of the

private sector, the outreach of churches and nongovernment organizations, and the infrastructure of public services. The project draws on the relative strengths
of other development partners, thereby fostering an
environment of cooperation and collaboration.

Economic operators at the center of six large rural
development enclaves in mining, oil and gas extraction, and plantations have signed memorandums of
understanding with the Government detailing how
they will help rehabilitate and support surrounding
rural health services, and introduce and support HIV/
AIDS testing, treatment, and care. The renovation of
rural health infrastructure such as aid posts and health
centers has begun.

Broad-based research on preferences has led to
the development of a new condom. Behavior change
programs are also being organized in communities surrounding the rural development enclaves.
A national surveillance plan has been finalized and
resources are being mobilized to improve HIV/AIDS
surveillance nationwide.

The Sanitation and Drainage Project began to
mitigate flooding in the capital. The Education Sector
Project II significantly helped harmonize donor activities in education, while the Small Business Development Project provided small-business loan guarantees,
micro loans, and business training.

Harmonization with funding agencies was further enhanced through joint missions to prepare the
country partnership strategy (2008-2012) and ADB’s
observer role in the high-level strategy talks between
the governments of Samoa, Australia, and New Zealand. The Pacific Islands Economic Report for Samoa
and a private sector assessment were prepared.

Solomon Islands

Partnership priorities. ADB continued to help the
Government provide transportation infrastructure and
services and promote private sector development.

Impact of operations. ADB largely completed the implementation of the Post-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation

 

 

Widespread damage

On 2 April, a massive undersea earthquake of magnitude 8.1 triggered a tsunami that struck the Western
and Choiseul provinces of Solomon Islands. Damage to housing, infrastructure, schools, and medical
facilities was widespread, and several villages were
destroyed. About 20,000 out of a total population of
90,000 were affected, with some 5,000 people displaced and 52 dead.

ADB's disaster and emergency assistance policy
prompted a rapid and effective response. ADB staff
were on the ground within a week of the disaster.
After an official request was made, ADB agreed to
take the lead in coordinating the rehabilitation effort
by government and development partner agencies.
ADB also prepared a $9 million Emergency Assistance
Project, which the Board approved within 11 weeks

Project ($18.5 million), involving the repair of roads and
other infrastructure damaged during the 1999-2003 conflict. The newly repaired roads helped increase economic
activity throughout the project area, and maintenance
contracts for local operators boosted private sector activity. ADB also continued its work on the $16.2 million
Solomon Islands Road Improvement Project, cofinanced
by the governments of Australia and New Zealand.

The new State-Owned Enterprise Act was developed with ADB support and passed in 2007. ADB
provided selective support in implementing the act,
especially in performance standards setting and
monitoring. ADB helped prepare two privatization
transactions in Solomon Islands. In the key area of
business law reform, with ADB support the Government prepared and submitted to Parliament bills on
new companies, secured transactions, and trustees.

Timor-Leste

Partnership priorities. ADB completed the country
operations business plan (2008-2010) for Timor
of the disaster. Asian Development Fund grant funds
catalyzed significant cofinancing from the European
Commission for the project.

The affected area generates a disproportionate
share of Solomon Islands’ national output and almost
all of its tourism. The effects of the disaster thus have
national economic implications. Recovery and rehabilitation depend on restoring access to affected areas
and maintaining public health. However, the disaster
has worsened the ability of major producers and rural
people to export agricultural and fisheries products,
gain access to markets and social services, support
tourism, and enjoy safe water supplies. Growth is
expected to slow down and poverty to worsen.

The Emergency Assistance Project will help the
Government rehabilitate damaged infrastructure—
rural and town roads, wharves and jetties, and the
Gizo town water supply and sanitation system—and
make it less vulnerable to climate change and natural
hazards. The rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure is expected to make rural areas accessible once
again, allow economic activities and social services to
resume, and safeguard public health.

Impact of operations. The Road Sector Improvement
Project supported project management, design and
supervision, community empowerment, and_ project performance monitoring. The Second Emergency
Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project helped employ
Timor-Leste’s rural poor while improving access to
markets and to education, health, and other basic services. Construction under the remaining three road
contracts was completed. The project created jobs,
injected money into poor communities, connected
them to services, and reduced economic costs.

Tonga

Partnership priorities. ADB’s country partnership strategy (2007-2012) is centered on poverty reduction and
anchored in prudent economic and fiscal management,
infrastructure development, and private sector growth.

Impact of operations. ADB, the Australian Agency for
International Development, the New Zealand International Aid and Development Agency, and the World
Bank signed a Joint Declaration on Aid Effectiveness
with the Government of Tonga in September. The
declaration applies the principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and sets out initiatives for
improved coordination of funding delivery in Tonga.
ADB mobilized technical assistance for the Rationalization of Public Enterprises, Phase III, and for
Support for the Implementation of the Strategic Development Plan 8. The Youth Microenterprise Develop
ment project continued developing pilot models for
self-employment of the youth.

Tuvalu

Partnership priorities. ADB’s assistance to Tuvalu
continued to rest on the joint Tuvalu-ADB-Australian
Agency for International Development strategy from
2006 and a set of benchmark indicators agreed on
between these parties and the New Zealand International Aid and Development Agency.

Impact of operations. ADB continued to help upgrade
the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (scheduled to
be completed in 2008) to double the number of seafarers trained per year. Remittances from seafarers are
an extremely important source of income for many in
Tuvalu. The Pacific Islands Economic Report Tuvalu
2006 Economic Report: From Plan to Action was published. ADB also substantially completed preparations
for the country partnership strategy (2008-2012).
The streamlining of the tax system was pursued with
the support of the Capacity Building for Taxation
Reforms project.

Vanuatu

Partnership priorities. ADB’s assistance program is
concerned with promoting sustainable private sector—
led economic growth.

Impact of operations. ADB continued to help Vanuatu
improve access to financial services by supporting
the Financial Services Commission in strengthening
its institutional framework, including its corporate
governance standards, supervisory capabilities, and
organizational structure; reforming the company and
bankruptcy laws; modernizing the registry of companies; and establishing a framework for secure transactions. The impact of these legal and institutional
reforms will be measured once they are implemented
over the next 18 months.

Overall, 2007 was a successful year for South
Asia. The South Asia Department aimed to
improve portfolio management, increase the
size and improve the relevance of lending
and nonlending operations, and introduce
innovative and flexible financing instruments
to its clients.Efforts to adopt the managing for development results approach in all aspects of
operations and build a strong operational knowledge base in South Asia were significantly expanded.

Lending was robust, surpassing previous levels and including significantly more new
lending products and modes in the power, education, rural and urban infrastructure, and
financial sectors. ADB approved 23 sovereign loan and Asian Development Fund grant
projects for $2.8 billion (of which 11 were subprojects coming from multitranche financing
facilities [MFFs], and 2 were blend loan and grant projects) and 1 nonsovereign public sector loan for $10 million (Table 27). Cumulative lending for the region as of the end of 2007
amounted to $33.9 billion (Table 31). ADB’s assistance also included technical assistance of
$36.9 million, four new MFFs of $1.7 billion, four grants from other sources of $21.5 million, and loans of $176.3 million through its private sector operations. ADB’s nonsovereign
approvals in the region totaled $411.3 million (Statistical Annex 10).

In line with the South Asia Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program (2006-2008), ADB
continued to support three main regional cooperation initiatives: the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC), and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic
Cooperation (BIMSTEC).

ADB supported the SAARC Regional Multimodal Transport Study, whose recommendations were endorsed by the 14th SAARC Summit. ADB also provided technical assistanceSOUTH ASIA

market and helped build technical capacity within the
SAARC Energy Center.

The Fourth SASEC Country Advisors’ Meeting
was held at ADB headquarters in Manila on 4-5 June.
Apart from the SASEC Information Highway Project,
the first regional investment project undertaken jointly
by four SASEC countries, ADB also supported SASEC
initiatives to develop regional tourism, improve transport logistics, facilitate trade, and promote cooperation on the environment through technical assistance.

ADB supported the implementation of the BIMSTEC
Transport Infrastructure and Logistics Study, which proposed the transport and logistics policy framework and
strategies, and implementing mechanisms.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

ADB intensified its efforts in project administration and
portfolio management, which significantly improved
key portfolio indicators. New records were reached in
disbursement ($2.0 billion, 48% better than in 2006;
$1.5 billion of this total were disbursements under
projects); contract awards and commitments ($2.1 billion, a 26% increase over projections and close to the
$2.3 billion achieved in 2006); and projects at risk were
reduced to 9.7% from 12.3% in 2006 (Table 29).

In Bangladesh, earlier improvements in portfolio
performance were sustained and even advanced in some
areas through concerted effort and ADB’s engagement
with the Government, and strong collaboration with
development partners. Portfolio performance in India
also improved markedly in project preparedness, project implementation, and capacity building, enabling
increased award of contracts and faster disbursement.

In Nepal, specific actions focused on improving project readiness, harmonizing procurement, improving
financial management, and rationalizing loan and
technical assistance portfolios. Project implementation in Sri Lanka continued to face security challenges,
but progress was made on several fronts in ongoing
post-tsunami reconstruction and rehabilitation, as evidenced by increased contract awards.

Auto rickshaw fueling up

Dhaka, a teeming city of more than 10 million people,
has roads that are noisy and busy, filled with buses,
cars, “auto rickshaws,” cycle rickshaws, and trucks. Yet
in recent years it has managed to cut pollution down
drastically—by about 60% between 2001 and 2004,
said Abdul Wadud, managing director, Rupantarita
Prakritik Gas Company Limited (RPGCL).

RPGCL can certainly take some of the credit
for this. With support from ADB’s Dhaka Clean Fuel
Project, RPGCL has opened the first compressed natural gas (CNG) filling stations in the country and set up
conversion workshops for vehicles so that they can
switch to the environment-friendly fuel.

About 1,400 buses now use CNG, making a tremendous difference to air quality. All of Dhaka’s
25,000 auto rickshaws now run on CNG, which is much
cheaper than petrol or even diesel.

Mohammad Nasimuddin, 60, has been driving
auto rickshaws for 15 years. When the vehicle owner

four core sectors—roads, power, urban infrastructure
development, and financial and private sector development—supports an integrated package of investment
operations, sector reform, and capacity development
to ensure that interventions are sustainable and that
development is effective and with discernible impacts.
ADB aims to open opportunities for domestic entrepreneurs while making the domestic financial system
more efficient so that it can offer a broader array of

switched to CNG some years ago, he increased
Nasimuddin’s rent fourfold to recoup the cost of conversion. And yet Nasimuddin’s profit shot up from
Tk150 (taka) to Tk400 (about $2.20-$5.80) a day! This
is mainly because his fuel costs have come down from
Tk300 to Tk70 a day.

Life is still hard for Nasimuddin’s family of four, but
it is certainly better than before, he said. “We can buy
more food, and if we can eat better, that’s enough,”
he added.

Before the introduction of CNG, the pollution was
really bad, he said. “My eyes and face would burn and
| would fall ill very often. | would continue to work, but
I'd feel ill,” Nasimuddin said. “But now | don’t have that
problem.”

Now more than 80,000 private cars and jeeps as
well as 12,000 taxis are running on CNG.

The very popularity of CNG, combined with greed,
has given rise to an unforeseen and serious problem.
The Daily Star, a Dhaka-based newspaper, reported
recently that cheap, substandard, and potentially
deadly CNG cylinders were being made in some unauthorized workshops.

Under the ADB-supported project, RPGCL is running a public awareness program to warn people that
they should use only authorized workshops for conversions. The company runs some of the 72 authorized conversion workshops in Dhaka.

“It took 20 years to convince people that CNG is
economic, it is safe, and it is replaceable,” said Abdul
Wadud. But it is finally done.

About 1,400 buses now use

but also to rural small and medium-sized enterprises.

Impact of operations. ADB assistance was channeled mainly to the energy (rural electrification)
and transport (roads) sectors to reduce remoteness
and isolation, which are among the major causes of
poverty. Poor households were able to use electric
lighting and appliances, and to establish small-scale
cottage industries, process food, and engage more
efficiently in small trades such as carpentry and tailoring. Health standards rose as households stoppedAnnual Report 2008

using kerosene lamps. ADB upgraded the main road
network, ensured adequate maintenance of the existing road network, increased rural accessibility, supported institutional strengthening, promoted private
sector participation, improved road technology and
productivity, and supported subregional links. ADB
helped establish a debt management system, enact
and implement a law to create private sector jobs,
strengthen the public resource management system,
and deepen capacity development of the autonomous
Auditor General’s Office.

India

Partnership priorities. The country partnership strategy
for 2008-2012 is being prepared. It will follow a resultsbased framework, and will be closely aligned with the
development priorities and sector strategies laid down
in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. ADB’s lending assistance
to India increased from an annual average of around
$1.3 billion in 2000-2005 to $2.4 billion in 2006-2007
on a multitranche financing facility full-facility basis.
Actual approvals (subprojects and regular loans) were
$1.5 billion in 2006 and $1.4 billion in 2007 (Figure 7).

ADB’s nonsovereign operations in India amounted
to $379.3 million. This included an Indian rupeedenominated private sectorloanequivalentto $79.3 million to set up and operate wind energy facilities in
India. The project is ADB’s first financing in the wind
power sector.

Microfinance beneficiaries’ income rose more than threefold

The Eleventh Five-Year Plan recognizes that growth
cannot be sustained or made more inclusive without
supporting physical and social infrastructure. Support for infrastructure development of the transport,
energy, and urban sectors will, therefore, remain the
focus of ADB’s assistance program for 2008-2010.

Impact of operations. ADB’s urban sector projects
improved access to water supply, sewerage, drainage,
and solid waste management in several states such as
Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh. Assistance to Tamil Nadu and Kerala for reconstruction
after the tsunami helped rebuild essential urban infrastructure and improve livelihood security.

ADB supported the National Highway Development Program and the Government’s Rural Roads
Program. The two projects are expected to promote
rural development by improving connectivity and creating jobs in five states—Assam, Chhattisgarh, Madhya
Pradesh, Orissa, and West Bengal.

ADB’s energy sector assistance has focused on upgrading the transmission and distribution network and supporting power sector reform across selected states. The two
power sector loans to Madhya Pradesh, approved in 2001
and 2007, helped operationalize an independent state electricity regulatory commission, facilitate the unbundling of
the State Electricity Board, and improve the overall governance of the power sector. At the national level, ADB has
been assisting the Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. in
strengthening the national transmission grid.

Maldives

Partnership priorities. In October, ADB endorsed anew
country partnership strategy (CPS) for the Maldives.
The CPS recognized that capacity gaps in institutions
and human resources have constrained achievement
of national goals and objectives. ADB support would
therefore follow a sequenced approach.

During phase I, a holistic set of capacity development interventions will be supported. For this purpose,
technical assistance loans will be provided to strengthen
economic and financial management in areas such as
internal audit capacity, tax administration, development
of a multiyear fiscal framework, debt management, and
strengthening of project management capacities. Capacity development will be supported to structure publicprivate partnerships in transport, power, and other areas,
including improving the enabling environment for small
and medium-sized enterprises in the private sector.

Once readiness is secured, ADB’s second phase of
assistance will include strategic support for investments
and sector reform in transport, power, and small and
medium-sized enterprise development. In each sector,
ADB will combine investment support with measures
to foster public-private partnerships and develop the
capacities of core sector agencies. The first private sector project in the Maldives was approved in the first
quarter: a $4.5 million private sector loan for financing
facilities for a leasing company.

Impact of operations. Over nearly two decades, ADB
has contributed greatly to economic development and
poverty reduction. The Operations Evaluation Department noted that ADB’s contributions to the country’s
development results were particularly useful. Sector
outcomes were achieved in transport and energy,
which accounted for about half of the total ADB lending during the review period.

Increasingly, however, implementation capacity constraints hamper ADB’s ability to contribute to
development results in a timely manner. The tsunami
and the ensuing relief effort, while handled courageously, placed a heavy burden on the civil service and
the nascent domestic construction industry. Although
the economy is recovering, the large backlog of unfinished development projects and reconstruction initiatives and the large buildup of public debt require that
ADB support for new public investments be phased in
gradually and judiciously.

Nepal

Partnership priorities. The country operations business plan (COBP) reviewed the implementation of
the country strategy and program (CSP) and adjusted
ADB’s assistance program for 2008-2010 based on the

Government’s development priorities, performance of
specific sectors, and project preparedness. The CSP
and COBP remain in line with the priorities of Nepal’s
Three-Year Interim Plan (FY2008-FY2010), which
was approved in December 2007 and is a continuation
of the Tenth Plan concluded in FY2007.

ADB started a comprehensive midterm review of
the CSP, to be completed in 2008. ADB also undertook
a country portfolio review mission in partnership with
the Government, the World Bank, the Japan Bank for
International Cooperation, and the Department for
International Development of the United Kingdom in
August, which reviewed the effectiveness of measures to
reduce project implementation bottlenecks and sustain
the improved portfolio performance in recent years.

Impactofoperations. The ongoing Community Groundwater Irrigation Sector Project, approved in February
1998, was completed in July 2007. The project installed
10,767 group shallow tubewells providing year-round
irrigation to about 54,000 hectares of agricultural
land, benefiting about 70,000 farm households. Most
beneficiary households are now producing wheat, while
44% of them are also growing cash crops and 45%
are cultivating twice as many vegetables than before
the project.

The ongoing Decentralized Rural Infrastructure
and Livelihood Project (approved in September 2004)
has constructed a total of 50 km of district roads and 34
trail bridges, using labor-based, environment-friendly,
and participatory approaches, and directly employing
about 82,000 unskilled local laborers. Some 68 savings and credit groups have also been formed from
among the laborers, with more than 40% participation by women, to promote livelihood and incomegenerating activities.

The $20.0 million Rural Microfinance Project,
approved by ADB in 1998, was completed in June 2007.
The Rural Microfinance Development Centre, established in October 1998 as the implementing agency,
provided microfinance services worth 19.4 billion
Nepalese rupees ($302.2 million) through 58 microfinance institutions to more than 500,000 families
spread over a third of Nepal’s 75 districts. The project
beneficiaries’ average annual per capita income rose
more than threefold by the end of the project, which
helped reduce poverty, especially among women.

Partnership priorities. ADB processed the Colombo
Port Expansion Project, the country’s biggest publicprivate partnership to date, which will substantially
impact on overall economic growth. Education and

Musuni Shrestha took a loan to buy buffaloes

In a picturesque village in Bhaktapur district, 30 km
from the capital Kathmandu, 50 women—all members of the Lamadanda Women’s Self-Help Center—
recite their oath. They resolve, among others, not
to discriminate against members of lower castes, to
spend wisely, to save, and to abstain from tobacco or
alcohol. They then get down to business.

“Namaste, sisters,” says 37-year-old Mana Kumari
Shrestha. “I need to borrow NRs4,000 (Nepalese rupees)
($63). | need some money to pay my children’s school
fees,” she explains, when asked by the coordinator why
she needs more after borrowing NRs18,000 ($286) previously. After a chorus of “yeas” from the assembled
group, the funds are approved.

The scene is typical of rural microcredit schemes that
have sprung up all over the countryside in recent years,
with women at the forefront. Observers say they have
been pivotal in empowering women and breaking down
gender barriers in Nepal's largely patriarchal rural society.

were processed and approved. The first portfolio
review mission was undertaken with the Government
actively introducing readiness criteria. Portfolio management proved respectable, given the difficult circumstances, including a resurgent civil conflict.

Priorities include transport, water supply, power,
education, post-conflict rehabilitation, and economic
management (fiscal management and public sector
banks). A new country partnership strategy also needs
to be formulated; this has now been postponed to
2008.

A private sector loan of $10.0 million was approved
to strengthen the leasing industry and expand the
funding resources and financial services available to

 

The Rural Microfinance Development Center Ltd.
(RMDO), a private sector development bank set up in
1999, says that 47 out of Nepal's 75 districts have a microcredit program through its 60 partner organizations.

“Such programs are making good contributions to
reducing both urban and rural poverty across Nepal,”
says RMDC senior manager Meghraj Gajurel. “The microfinance programs also have a very good loan recovery
rate of 99-100%,” he adds. Many commercial banks, by
contrast, typically have high loan default levels.

One of the key groups at the forefront of the microcredit revolution is the Kathmandu-based Center for
Self-Help Development, a nonprofit organization running programs in at least seven hill districts, including
Lamadanda in the adjoining Bhaktapur district, one of
its first success stories. Funded by ADB’s Rural Microfinance Project, it now has over 22,000 members—all
poor women—in remote villages across the country.

Sanjamaya Lama is testimony to that success. The
41-year-old member of the Lamadanda Women’s SelfHelp Center lost her husband nearly a year ago but,
thanks to a loan, she is coping. “| took about NRs18,000
in aloan.... Rearing goats and buffaloes and investing
in my children’s education is helping slowly.”

Like her fellow group members, she is clear about
how she will pay the loan back. “We make some income.
And | also got work at a construction site. No worries.
| will have no problem saving so that | can pay it back.”

small and medium-sized enterprises. A nonsovereign
project for leasing companies was delivered jointly
by the South Asia Department and the Private Sector
Operations Department.

Impact of operations. Government improved tax
administration and revenue collection, and closed tax
loopholes with support of ADB’s fiscal management
reform project.

ADB assistance was also helpful in supporting and
building trust in conflict-affected areas. Ongoing projects in the east of the country are picking up again (such
as the Batticaloa water supply), bringing urgently needed
basic social infrastructure to badly neglected areas.

Lending reached a record level of $3.2 billion
for 17 sovereign and 6 nonsovereign loan
projects (Table 35), almost 72% higher than the
approvals in 2006. The sovereign loans include
eight program loans for $1.6 billion to support
the financial and capital market sectors, poverty
reduction, development policy reforms, and local
government financing.ADB’s nonsovereign approvals in the region totaled $158 million (Statistical Annex 10). The
nonsovereign loans include one project for the public sector, the first for the region, and five
projects for the private sector in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Viet Nam.

Grants approved amounted to $144.3 million for 11 projects, with funding through
the Asian Development Fund (ADF), cofinancing, and the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (Table 33). Technical assistance amounted to $30.1 million for 44 projects, including
7 supplementary ones, funded through the Technical Assistance Special Fund, Japan Special
Fund, and cofinancing (Table 32).

Key measures were introduced to strengthen the accountability of administering units
and quality control mechanisms. A management-driven monitoring system was put in place
to raise the profile of and improve portfolio management work.

More attention was paid to broader structural issues affecting project performance,
such as alignment of annual project work plans with government budget cycles. Systemic
issues in project implementation were addressed through close collaboration with governments and development partners, and the role of resident missions was further enhanced.

The Declaration of Support for the Heart of Borneo was signed by Brunei Darussalam,
Indonesia, and Malaysia, which all share Borneo Island. With support from the World Wildlife Fund, the initiative aims to conserve a total of 220,000 square kilometers of equatorial
rainforest through a network of protected areas.

ADB also supported increasingly active engagement in the subregional economic initiative by the private sector, local governments, media, and other stakeholders of the Brunei

REGIONAL COOPERATION

ADB continued to lead in promoting regional and subregional cooperation. It participated in the 12th ASEAN
Summit in January, and organized and participated in
the first ASEAN Secretariat-ADB high-level consultation meeting held in June in Indonesia, which discussed
the joint 2007-2008 work plan for implementing the
ADB-ASEAN memorandum of understanding.

A regional cooperation operations business plan
for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Program
was completed and endorsed by Management in
September.

A new Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT) road map, prepared with ADB assistance, was endorsed by the Second IMT-GT Leaders’
Summit in January. ADB helped establish a permanent
secretariat, the Center for IMT-GT Subregional Cooperation, in Selangor, Malaysia. The Third IMT-GT
Leaders’ Summit, held alongside the ASEAN meetings
in Singapore in November, commended ADB’s participation as a development partner and made three specific proposals for ADB assistance.

With ADB assistance, BIMP-EAGA greatly
improved transport connectivity with the signing of
three key transport agreements. ADB provided technical assistance (TA) for the ongoing effort to streamline customs, immigration, quarantine, and security

biodiversity. ADB increased its TA for the BIMPEAGA economic initiative, from $700,000 in 2006 to
close to $3 million in 2007 and 2008.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

As of 31 December, ADB had 155 ongoing loans and
ADF grants (equivalent to 149 ongoing projects) in

Southeast Asia, with a net loan amount of $10.5 billion,
while the TA portfolio had 215 active projects with a
total revised amount of $253.4 million. ADB, by the end
of 2007, had achieved 99% of its annual projections for
contract awards (for loans and ADF grants) and 105% of
its disbursement targets (for loans and ADF grants).

COUNTRY HIGHLIGHTS

Brunei Darussalam

Partnership priorities. Brunei Darussalam joined ADB
in 2006. Since its inception in 1994, Brunei Darussalam
has been an active member of BIMP-EAGA, which
has received increased support from ADB over the last
few years. The Government has expressed interest in
Brunei-funded and ADB-executed technical assistance,
initially in capital market development.

Rich in oil, but with declining output over the medium
term, the country faces a number of challenges. Human
resources and skills are in short supply, and the country is
heavily dependent on foreign contract workers, both for
menial jobs and for skilled labor. The economy is dominated by the public sector, with many services provided for
free or heavily subsidized. Economic diversification away
from energy and gradually decreasing dominance of the
public sector are high on the Government’s agenda. ADB
will provide technical advice where required and continue
assistance through the BIMP-EAGA program.

Cambodia

Partnership priorities. Continued political stability provided the backdrop for another year of stellar economic
growth (9.6%). While agricultural production again performed strongly, however, economic development continued to be mostly urban-based and rural poverty remained
a priority area. Accordingly, the Government reemphasized rural development as a top priority.

The country strategy and program (CSP) (20052009), which is fully in line with the Government’s
National Strategic Development Plan (2006-2010),
aims to foster sustainable pro-poor growth, inclusive

social development, and improved governance and
service delivery. The CSP midterm review endorsed the
overall strategic approach but identified the need for a
sharper focus on agricultural and rural development.
ADB’s interventions in the agriculture and rural sector centered on the Tonle Sap basin area, where 38% of
the population falls under the official poverty line. ADB’s
social development priorities were education reform and
better health and communicable disease control. Private

sector development priorities included second-generation
support to strengthen and deepen the financial sector and
create more backward value-chain-type links between
private sector and rural development. ADB focused on
risk management initiatives, particularly in public financial management, procurement, and other efforts to
reduce corruption.

Impact of operations. The Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project continued to help reach
Cambodia’s Millennium Development Goal of 50% coverage of safe water supply and 30% coverage of sanitation in rural areas by 2015.

Under the Second Education Sector Development
Program, the Education Law was passed and a related
legislative instrument action plan drafted, the recurrent
budget allocation for education increased by more than

 

 

Clean water for villagers

The Tonle Sap in Cambodia is the largest freshwater
lake in Southeast Asia, but provinces around it have
limited access to safe water and sanitation. An ADB
project is providing a solution.

Farmer Vorn Mao used to collect water for her
family from foul-smelling and hazardous streams in
a remote village. In the dry season, the 36-year-old
mother of two had to dig for water, or trek 2 km or
more to streams where many people also washed
their clothes or bathed. Without the means to treat the
water, she and her family often suffered from diarrhea,
fever, and skin problems.

Now, times have changed and Vorn Mao and her
family and neighbors have safe, clean, and accessible
water, thanks to a deep-well pump installed as part of
the Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector
Project. Funded by ADB through an $18 million grant
from the Asian Development Fund, the project is part
of the Tonle Sap initiative launched by ADB in 2002.

23% over 2006, and 100 new lower secondary schools
were built, benefiting 32,000 students in remote and
disadvantaged areas. Under the Health Sector Support
Project, the Health Sector Strategic Plan (2008-2015)
was reviewed, the construction and rehabilitation of
six additional health facilities and four referral hospitals were financed, and actual recurrent health spending
increased by an estimated 31.4% over 2006.

ADB continued to help improve the investment climate, through such means as the continued implementation
of the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development
Program Loan, which helped streamline business registration and licensing procedures, and the Financial Sector
Program Loan, which strengthened the legal foundations
for banking, insurance, and commercial development;
tightened supervision and surveillance of financial institutions; and developed the financial market.

Clean Water for Tonle Sap’s Poor

“I’m very happy we now have a water well,” Vorn
Mao says. “Because of the reduction in sickness, we
spend less on medicine.”

Since 1989, more and more people have gained
access to safe water and sanitation, mainly because of
external assistance. Yet rural water supply coverage
remains the second lowest in Asia.

By the time it is completed in 2011, the Tonle Sap
project aims to provide water supply and sanitation
facilities to about 1,760 villages or 1.8 million people
in the five target provinces.

A key element of the project is the active participation of the communities, which help select, plan, share
the cost, implement, operate, and maintain the facilities.

In the case of deep-well pumps, which cost an average of $1,800 to set up, the beneficiaries shoulder 10%
of the cost in cash or in kind and take part in managing
the facility through a water and sanitation user group.

Drawn from the heads of user households, group
members contribute to the capital and maintenance
costs of the facilities.

“We have a plan to protect the facility from mold.
Then lalso collect money from the user families to cover
maintenance costs. So if there are minor problems, we
can have the facility fixed,” said Vorn Mao, who is a
group board member.

in sickness, we spend less

ADB helped improve the central Government’s public financial management and decentralize authority to
local governments. Technical assistance strengthened the
capacity of the Ministry of Economy and Finance to manage and monitor public sector debt. ADB also carried out
governance risk assessments of two ministries and recommended specific corruption mitigation measures.

Indonesia

Partnership priorities. The country strategy and program
(2006-2009) is fully aligned with the Government’s
medium-term development plan. It addresses a number
of constraints on achieving higher pro-poor sustainable
economic growth and improving social development.

The focus was on infrastructure development, financial sector deepening, decentralized development, faster
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and
environmental and natural resource management. Particular attention was given to supporting the Government’s
reform programs and to increasing private sector participation in financing development needs, especially infrastructure. To support these reforms and initiatives, ADB assisted
the country with several key conferences and seminars.

Impact of operations. The Third Development Policy
Support Program, approved by the Board in December,
is part of the development policy loan series being coordinated by the World Bank in Indonesia to support the
transition from postcrisis stabilization to long-term development. At the request of the Government, ADB has been
engaged in the development policy loan series since 2005.

The development policy loan program helped
advance reform and improve the investment climate by
shortening value-added tax refund times, rolling out a
national single window with online clearance on merchandise, and reducing the time needed to start a business. Core government cash operations were consolidated
into the Treasury Single Account, blanket guarantees on
deposits were eliminated in phases, and legislation set up
an independent national procurement office.

The Earthquake and Tsunami Emergency Support
Program, with a total grant of $300 million, completed
its third year of assistance in rebuilding Aceh and Nias.
Cumulative contract awards reached $138 million,
with disbursements at $120 million. The program also
reached out to citizens affected by the 30-year conflict
that has held back Aceh’s development. To better sustain recovery efforts, ADB provided technical assistance
for institutional strengthening.

Lao People’s Democratic Republic

Partnership priorities. A country operations business
plan (COBP) was prepared. ADB’s country strategy
and program (CSP) (2007-2011) began implemen
tation. The CSP reflects lessons learned from ADB’s
experience in the country and introduces greater sector selectivity and focus, and proposes a move toward
a programmatic approach. The CSP is aligned with
and anchored on the Government’s development
framework and seeks to promote pro-poor sustainable growth, foster social inclusiveness, and improve
governance.

The framework is embodied in the Government’s
Sixth Five-Year Development Plan (SEDP6), which
includes a strategy for poverty reduction and sustainable development and continued to be implemented
successfully. Steps were taken to create a more enabling
environment for business and investment and a more
open trade regime.

Impact of operations. The country continued to witness robust economic growth and to make progress in
achieving its income-related Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), but not its non-income MDG commitments. The COBP largely supported SEDP6 and CSP
implementation through ADB’s performance-based
ADF allocation, regional ADF allocations, and selective
ordinary capital resources and private sector operations.
The COBP was designed to help mobilize public-private
partnerships, cofinancing operations, ADB-administered trust funds, and special initiatives from ADB’s
Regional and Sustainable Development Department,
and to promote the broader use of financial instruments
and further partnerships with the ADB Institute and
other development partners.

Malaysia

Partnership priorities. The development plan (the Ninth
Plan) calls for increased cooperation with ADB, particularly in exchanging development experiences in other
countries. ADB proposed a country partnership strategy
to identify broad areas for collaboration to strengthen the
country’s competitiveness and private sector development,
such as private sector financing of infrastructure investments, capital market development, and environmentally
sustainable development. ADB provided technical assistance for economic modeling and forecasting in the Ministry

Asia (aSEA) regional cooperation strategy includes a
central role for Malaysia in cross-border transport and
energy projects with Indonesia, and in a range of technical assistance activities. The regional cooperation strategy was designed to complement the country partnership

ADB continued to monitor economic development and
will formulate an operational strategy when appropriate. ADB approved the last loan projects in 1986 and
the last technical assistance projects in 1987.

Philippines

Partnership priorities. The country operations business
plan (2007-2008) extended the country strategy and
program (CSP) (2005-2007) by 1 year, after an assessment revealed that the CSP’s core elements remain
relevant, especially their explicit alignment with the
Government’s strategy and priorities.

The accelerating pace and quality of fiscal consolidation and sector reforms enabled ADB to move to its highcase lending scenario. In 2006, lending and disbursement
were the highest since 1998, and the net resource transfer
continued to be positive for the second year since 1997.
In 2007, ADB approved a more favorable cost-sharing
and expenditure eligibility for investment projects in
order to increase project borrowing and the use of new
lending modes such as the multitranche financing facility,
for which some operations were planned.

Impact of operations. Since the East Asian crisis of 1997,
the Philippines has had limited capacity to budget large
infrastructure projects suchas power, roads, and airports.
ADB has responded with support for reforms in key sectors, including power, finance, local government finance
and budgeting, judicial reform, and microfinance. Since
1998, 72% of new lending has been for policy-based
operations, and both new loans in 2006 were for policy
support. Much of the assistance is designed to reduce the
fiscal imbalance.

While the impact of ADB-supported reforms is likely
to be revealed over time, the sharply improved fiscal
situation has allowed the authorities to reorient priorities to more directly reduce poverty and joblessness, and
increase access to services. ADB continued to support
better public expenditure management, a strengthened
regulatory framework, greater certainty in the rule of
law, and improved service delivery by local authorities.
As reforms gain traction, it is expected that investment
will revive, jobs will be created, growth will accelerate,
and faster inroads into poverty will be possible.

Thailand

Partnership priorities. In May, the Board endorsed the
5-year country partnership strategy (CPS) to support
Thailand’s efforts to enhance its global competitiveness
and increase private investment. The CPS was designed
to increase Thailand’s role, capacity, and effectiveness
as a regional development partner through cofinancing

projects in neighboring countries; promote subregional
trade and investment; and further develop Asian bond
markets. ADB and Thailand shared experiences and
expertise in supporting subregional cooperation programs and regional economic integration. Core strategic
areas of partnership were infrastructure development,
capital markets, and environmental sustainability.
ADB’s private sector operations expanded. The
Thailand Resident Mission and the Private Sector Operations Department continued to work closely to support
private sector development and investment flows in
energy, infrastructure development, and capital markets.

Impact of operations. Three technical assistance (TA)
projects were completed. The first helped the Ministry of
Finance and the Ministry of Transport structure private
concessions for proposed lines to expand the Bangkok
rail mass rapid transit network. The second supported
capital market development by covering the positioning
of the Stock Exchange of Thailand in the medium and
long term. Under the third TA project, ADB proposed a
framework of economic instruments to reduce environmental pollution. An ongoing project is helping look at
rules and regulations on borrowings and bond issuance
by local governments and build the capacity of local
governments for borrowing and bond issuance.

Viet Nam

Partnership priorities. The country strategy and program (2007-2010) was designed to significantly expand
ADB’s operations; support pro-poor, business-led economic growth, social inclusiveness, and environmental
protection and management; and emphasize governance
and regional cooperation as key crosscutting priorities.

Impact of operations. ADB supported a broad range of
sectors. It provided a fourth program loan to cofinance
the implementation of the Poverty Reduction Program,
through the Poverty Reduction Support Credit financed
by several development partners, as part of the Government’s Socio-Economic Development Plan for 20062010.

A lead donor in the education sector, ADB has promoted inclusive development by providing five loans
totaling $220 million to enhance the quality, equity,
effectiveness, and sustainability of secondary education.
Ongoing operations have shown an overwhelmingly positive trend in expansion of schooling, and greatly helped
achieve the Government's priority sector goal of universal lower secondary education by 2010.

connectivity with other GMS countries and helped
increase trade between the country and its Mekong
neighbors. In 1992-2006, Viet Nam’s combined exports
to the other Mekong countries grew by 24.0% per year,
on average, and the share of such exports in total exports
increased from 6.5% to 8.8%. ADB substantially supported the power sector through the ongoing Northern
Power Transmission Sector Project.

Governance improvements are supported through
the entire portfolio of ADB operations in Viet Nam. For
example, the ongoing Third Financial Sector Program
helped improve governance by making progress in meeting its goals of expanding the nonbank financial sector
through improved capital markets, introducing a wide
range of legal and regulatory structures, and creating a

 

Girls with a brighter future

On Bali’s west coast, 3 hours from the tourist crowds of the
island's capital Denpasar, is a hidden world of poverty that
visitors rarely get to see.

Jembrana, about 120 km west of these tourist
areas, is Bali’s poorest district, where poverty levels
approach 40%. Outwardly, it is deceptively picture
perfect, with stunning rice terraces overshadowed by
distant volcanoes.

But this is a district where unemployment and
underemployment are high, wages are low, and many
people depend on casual or seasonal labor, mostly in
the fields and on fishing boats, earning the equivalent of
little more than $1 per day.

One such laborer is Antiri, who is in her mid-30s but
looks much older, her skin hardened by years of outdoor
toil. “| am from a poor family,” she said. “I have to work
hard if! want to put aside some money to pay for schooling of my children.”

One of her children, Susilo, while a student at Jembrana’s Negara 4 Junior Secondary School, received a

more diversified, extensive, and resilient financial sector.
ADB continued to work with other donors to help the
Government apply results-based management. It helped
organize the Third International Roundtable in Ha Noi
and develop the monitoring and evaluation framework
for the Socio-Economic Development Plan, which was
approved in May. Through the joint activities of the Six
Banks (ADB, Agence Frangaise de Développement, Japan
Bank for International Cooperation, Korea Eximbank,
Kreditanstalt fiir Wiederafbau, and the World Bank),
ADB helped strengthen government systems for the management of public investment and official development
assistance, including systems for project processing, procurement management, public financial management,
and environmental and social safeguards.

scholarship supported by the ADB-funded Decentralized Basic Education Project, which operates in the
province.

“We give the parents Rp60,000 (rupiah) ($6.50)
for equipment and clothes,” explained Juminah, the
school’s headmistress. “Three days later, the parents are
required to report back to us what they have bought—
bags, shoes, books, or uniforms.” These funds go to the
neediest children who are identified by the village head,
school committee, and teachers.

The scholarships are just one small part of the project. Supported by an ADB loan of $100 million and a
Government contribution of $25 million, the education project was approved in November 2001 and is
designed to encourage poor families to send their children to school and allow them to complete at least 9
years of basic education.

A key plank is the refurbishing and rebuilding of
schools, including some destroyed by the December
2004 tsunami. Cofinancing support has come from the
Netherlands, which in March 2006 committed $28 million to expand the project into six more districts in Nusa
Tenggara Timur. A total of 5,273 schools—including
Islamic madrasah—have been earmarked for support
by the time the loan closes at the end of 2008.

Stakeholders say the project is bearing fruit. Education officials noted that dropout rates are falling and
enrollment rates rising. For headmistress Juminah, that
provides a ray of hope. “They are beginning to respond.
| hope that these children in the future can have a better
life than their parents.”

Beyond providing money, ADB assists host countries
and private sector clients in a way that mitigates
risks, facilitates regulatory dialogue, and provides
technical expertise.

ADB’s Private Sector Operations Department
(PSOD) directly assists developing member countries
(DMCs) through projects with development impact,
which may, however, have limited access to capital.
PSOD participates in projects through nonsovereign
loans (loans to the private and public sectors, including state-owned enterprises); equity investments; and
credit enhancement products (including guarantees
and B-loans, where ADB arranges a complete financing
package for a project and thus encourages local and
international commercial banks to participate). Entities seeking assistance from ADB for a private sector
project benefit not only from financial assistance but
also from the expertise and guidance of the ADB team.

Operations are directed mainly to the capital markets
and financial sectors, and to the infrastructure sector.
The regional operations departments began processing
nonsovereign projects in 2007.

Nonsovereign operations grew continuously, with
total new financing reaching a record $1.8 billion (Table
11) in 2007, 23% above the level for 2006. Growth was
relatively uniform across various sectors. New debt financing approvals grew 50% (from $575.0 million to $865.0

Financing Energy Efficiency in the People’s Republic of China

 

 

ADB's public and private sector operations groups work closely
together

Energy demand in the People’s Republic of China
(PRC), the world’s second-largest energy consumer
and one of the largest emitters of greenhouse
gases, is growing rapidly to support the economic
growth needed to raise the living standards of
the large population. Energy efficiency will moderate growth in fossil energy demand, ease the
upward pressure on energy prices, and improve
energy security.

Despite the recent policy shift in favor of energy
efficiency, however, market barriers still limit energy
efficiency in the PRC. ADB approved the Energy Efficiency Multiproject Financing Program to meet the
need. It will provide credit guarantees up to CNY800
million ($114.2 million) in favor of selected financial
institutions to cover the credit risk associated with
financing energy efficiency projects. The program aims

to mobilize available domestic funds to much-needed
energy efficiency projects and enable a large number
of energy end users to improve energy efficiency.

The program will demonstrate the potential
for energy efficiency in retrofitted and new buildings, which are untapped areas of energy efficiency,
and set standards for competitors to follow. More
efficient use of energy will improve the global and
local environment. The program will also support the
Government's efforts to build a resource-saving society through private sector participation. It will help
remove barriers to investments in energy efficiency
by showing that energy efficiency projects are bankable and encouraging the private sector to invest in
them. The program is fully in line with ADB’s country
and sector strategies as well as the Government's strategic intentions.

million) and guarantees trebled (from $124.8 million to
$376.0 million). In the past 2 years, credit enhancement
products such as guarantees and B-loans supplemented
direct loan financing and equity investments. Because of
this, the total nonsovereign financing approved in 2006 and
2007 equaled the financing approved in 1996-2005. The
average size of projects processed by PSOD increased from
$44.0 million for 9 projects in 2000 to $65.0 million for
27 projects in 2007. PSOD staff members grew from 38
in 2000 to 66 by the end of 2007.

PSOD operations were once again evenly divided
between infrastructure and financial services, with new
infrastructure financing at $900.0 million and financial market financing at $846.0 million. Infrastructure
financing went to the energy, transport, water and
waste disposal, telecommunications, and other sectors where ADB participation has a clear development
impact, with special priority given to renewable energy
use and energy efficiency. For example, a 3.5 billion
rupee loan was approved for a wind power project in
India, and a $107.0 million financing program with
credit guarantees will be used by commercial banks to
fund energy-efficient projects in the People’s Republic
of China. In the capital markets and financial sectors,
priority was given to projects that strengthen and
deepen the financial markets in DMCs, such as the
development of the secondary markets for nonperforming assets, diversified payment rights securitization for
banks and other forms of securitization finance, and
small and medium-sized enterprise finance.

Nonsovereign operations have diversified geographically. At the end of 2007, nonsovereign projects
were being administered in 20 DMCs (compared with
only 13 a decade earlier), after the approval of the first
private sector projects in Mongolia, Afghanistan, Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, Maldives, Cambodia,
and the Central Asian republics of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Georgia.

At the same time, the portfolio quality of private
sector financing continued to improve, with impaired
assets as a percentage of total nonsovereign-backed
financing falling to 2% from 22% in 2000.

Coupled with the increase in financing, this trend
underscores the success of ADB’s new strategy for and
approach to nonsovereign operations.

UNDERLYING APPROACH

These successes reflect ADB’s strategy, which stresses the
importance of private sector development and a close
working relationship between ADB’s public and private
sector operations groups. These two go hand in hand
and are at the core of ADB’s relevance and strength.
For example, the public sector operations group led
the original privatization of a power utility company
in Pakistan that made possible a successful competitive
sale to the private sector. PSOD then provided a nonsovereign loan of $150 million to a cofinancing project
with other development institutions and private sector
banks, enabling the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation to upgrade its generation facilities and its transmission and distribution network, and to cut power losses,
use cleaner technology, operate more efficiently, and
produce economic benefits for the country.

Despite the current turmoil in the financial markets, the liquidity of the global capital markets has
never been higher. This presents a major challenge for
multilateral development banks. All were established
to financially support development—a role that today
is better played by the capital markets. To remain vital,
multilateral development banks must reexamine and
redefine their absolute and comparative advantages.

Public-private partnership is the core offering
of ADB. This pioneering approach is fundamentally
different from the traditional approach of multilateral
development banks, with its continued emphasis on
providing financial liquidity. ADB undertakes transactions in developing member countries where overall
risks may be perceived as relatively high but where
the commercial deal is compelling and highly developmental. In so doing, ADB can help the private sector
(both project sponsors and cofinancing partners)
concentrate on business issues rather than the wider
risk environment.

COFINANCING

As a matter of internal policy, PSOD directly funds no
more than 25% of the total cost of any one project.
In rare circumstances where small transactions are
accepted for their high development impact, the department will directly support a higher percentage of the

Restructuring delinquent borrowers’ loans

In the late 1980s, the National Home Mortgage Financing Company (NHMFC) embarked on the Unified Home
Lending Program to finance low-income housing
in the Philippines. As the houses were built, NHMFC
purchased the mortgage-secured loans extended to
home buyers by accredited financial institutions and
housing developers, using funds borrowed from the
Social Security System, the Government Service Insurance System, and the Home Development Mutual
Fund (Pag-IBIG)—the funders.

The program faced growing difficulties in its
9 years of implementation. By 1996, large uncollected
loan accounts made the funders reluctant to give
more support.

In May 2004, NHMFC auctioned off the highly
delinquent loans in the portfolio. DB Real Estate Global
Opportunities IB, L.P. (DBGO) won in the bidding. ADB
provided debt financing of up to $33 million to Balikatan Housing Finance, Inc., the special-purpose vehicle
jointly owned by DBGO and NHMFC, which acquired the
nonperforming loans from NHMFC. ADB also invested
in a 10% equity stake in Bahay Financial Services, Inc.,
a loan-servicing company established by DBGO to
restructure and service the loans on behalf of Balikatan
Housing Finance. A Philippine-peso bond issue—a first
for ADB—provided the necessary funding.

The transaction strengthened the financial position of the funders and provided much-needed
liquidity to the pension system, as NHMFC was able

overall financing. PSOD’s efforts therefore require a
close and collaborative relationship with the financial
community, which is enhanced by the various guarantee and cofinancing products ADB offers, demand for
which has increased substantially in the last 2 years.

to repay a part of its obligations to the funders. It
also allowed NHMFC to substantially restructure its
mortgage portfolio and to concentrate on being a
secondary housing mortgage institution. Delinquent
borrowers have been given the chance to restructure
their loans and eventually own their homes without
further encumbrances once their debts are fully paid.
The transaction proved that low-income housing is
creditworthy, and thus catalyzes much-needed housing finance from the private sector.

This transaction marked the first time that a local
financial entity had sold nonperforming assets (NPAs)
of such magnitude to a foreign investor, and showed
domestic and international investors that the country
was determined to solve its NPA problem. Introducing
a replicable, market-tested mechanism for NPA resolution achieved a demonstration effect, and induced
the growth of the NPA market in the Philippines, as it
developed benchmarks, bankable structures, and trust
in the enabling legal and regulatory environment.
The transaction also sent a strong signal to Philippine
banks that they had to deal proactively with their
NPA problems.

ADB was involved in the transaction from the start,
working alongside NHMFC and its external advisers to
put together a bankable transaction structure. Given
the difficulty of obtaining local or international debt
financing, for a new and untested asset class, ADB’s
third-party financing support was critical.

PSOD cofinanced with ADB’s financial sector partners a total of 25 transactions, catalyzing $425.0 million of direct new money for developing member
countries, which went to projects with an aggregate
cost of $4.1 billion.

ADB defines knowledge management as
the way organizations create, capture,
store, retrieve, enhance, disseminate, and
apply knowledge to achieve organizational
objectives. ADB manages knowledge in
various ways.85

 

The overarching strategy is set by the knowledge
management framework, with its five key action programs: improved organizational culture for knowledge
sharing; improved management system of knowledge
products and services; improved business processes
and information technology (IT); well-functioning
communities of practice; and expanded knowledge
creation, sharing, learning, and dissemination through
external relations and networking.

The operational departments help implement the
framework by, among other things, embedding best
practice and the latest or most appropriate technology
in ADB-supported projects. Operational departments
also play a major role in delivering ADB’s program of
technical assistance, which generates and facilitates the
use of new, useful, and usable knowledge.

The work of the operational departments is supported and complemented by the work of four knowledge departments. Three of these are in headquarters:
the Economics and Research Department, Office of
Regional Economic Integration, and Regional and
Sustainable Development Department. The ADB Institute, in Tokyo, is able to stand back from day-to-day
operations and generates and disseminates knowledge
with a longer-term perspective. The Operations Evaluation Department (OED), while not formally included
as one of the four “knowledge departments,” also generates a wealth of knowledge, insights, and “lessons
learned” about development effectiveness. A list of
main “knowledge products” produced in 2007 by
these four departments and OED is in Appendix 14.

ADB’S COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE

ADB can add value and support developing member
countries by continuing to build on three areas of
comparative advantage in terms of knowledge. First,
ADB has deep and wide access to all governments in
the Asia and Pacific region and so possesses excellent
country-specific insights and regional perspective. Second, ADB is demonstrably able to provide an intersectoral and interdisciplinary approach to development
issues, blending expertise in disciplines as critical and
as varied as economics, finance, environment, engineering, energy efficiency, project management, and social
impacts. Third, ADB not only produces knowledge: it
can and does supplement that with large, long-term
development financing.

ADB thus has some of the hallmarks of a research
institution and of national think tanks. But its value
extends beyond analytical rigor through its access to
government, its capacity to identify trends within and
across the region, its interdisciplinary approach, and
its capacity to implement good insights and knowledge
via large and attractive financing.

The following provides a snapshot of some of the
main knowledge management activities delivered by
ADB during 2007. Some activities were directed at
external audiences, others were directed internally.

MEETING THE NEEDS
OF EXTERNAL AUDIENCES

Increasing Knowledge Resources on
Growth, Development, Poverty, and Equity

ADB creates and supplies knowledge to a wide external audience: developing member countries of course,
but also other stakeholders interested in development
and looking for good data and insights, such as other
development partners, the private sector, researchers,
and other developing countries outside the region that
engage with the Asia and Pacific region. The following
summarizes how ADB has provided such knowledge
for various important themes.

The special chapter of ADB’s Key Indicators
produced important new findings on an issue critical
to the quality of development: rising inequity in the
region. Important new insights were gained. First, the
increases in inequality imply that the impact of a given
amount of economic growth on poverty reduction will
be less than it has been in the past. Second, the current policies in place in Asia appear to favor promoting faster growth among the richer segments of the
population. Understanding why this is happening and
how policy can create more jobs for relatively poorer
groups will be critical for promoting more inclusive
growth in developing Asia.

These ADB-generated insights drew renewed
attention to the issue of equity and helped shape subsequent international debate. For example, the special
chapter was cited in high-profile articles, including two
editorials in the Financial Times, an editorial in all three
editions of The Wall Street Journal, and a full-page article in The Economist. Of the 250 articles that cited the
special chapter, 12 were in Chinese and subsequently
carried by up to 66 websites in Chinese.

To be cited by peers is evidence of research credibility. The World Bank cited Asian Development Outlook (ADO) 2006: Routes to Asia’s Trade in its East Asian
Renaissance Ideas for Economic Growth; and the International Monetary Fund cited ADO 2007 and the Key
Indicators 2007 in its Asia and Pacific Economic Outlook
2007, and in various United Nations publications. For
the first time, The Economist carried an ADO 2007 story
based on one of its feature essays: “Ten Years After
the Crisis: The Facts about Investment and Growth.”
A notable feature of coverage of ADO 2007 is that

86

Asian Development Bank

 

many media stories latched on to its policy and analytical essays. About 400 news articles on ADO 2007
were tracked, more than 60 of which appeared in the
targeted media.

Poverty and equity in the region were also the central theme of Millennium Development Goals: Progress in
Asia and the Pacific 2007. This important update was the
latest in a series of regional progress reports. It focused
on disparities—identifying some of the groups that are
not sharing fully in national progress, and advocating inclusive growth. The report is a joint effort with
the United Nations Economic and Social Commission
for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) and the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

ADB continued to lead in generating and disseminating knowledge and insights in this area, with several new studies unveiled, including, for example, The
Dynamics of Regional Development: The Philippines in East
Asia. A decade and a half since the Philippines embarked
on a major program of decentralization, this book
examines in detail all aspects of the country’s regional
dynamics and policies. Analysis extends to comparable
experiences in East and Southeast Asia, particularly the
People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Indonesia. The
lessons of this book are relevant not only for an audience interested in the Philippines—a large developing
nation with a population soon to exceed 100 million
people—but also for many other developing countries
now embarking on decentralization programs.

Knowledge about Economics and Finance

ADB continued to generate and disseminate important
new research about economics and finance. For example, the International Comparison Program (ICP) for
Asia and the Pacific enabled a meaningful comparison
of major macroeconomic and development indicators
across Asia. The study was then cited in more than 70
articles, including those in the websites of the Jnternational Herald Tribune, Forbes, Business Week, CNNIBN-posted wire dispatches, Associated Press, Reuters,
Thomson Financial, and Xinhua. Newspapers in many
Asian countries also featured the ICP report.

The Asia Economic Monitor is a biannual publication based on a confidential report that is presented at
the ASEAN+3 (Association of Southeast Asian Nations

ADB continued to generate

and central bank deputies meetings on economic prospects and policy issues. Through this vehicle, ADB is the
only international financial institution that conducts
policy dialogue with the ASEAN+3 finance ministers,
allowing ADB to inform and influence policy making at
the highest ministerial level. The July issue, which had
two theme chapters on managing capital flows and the
banking sector 10 years after the Asian financial crisis,
was reported on in more than 50 major global newspapers and international wire agencies.

The AsianBondsOnline website (http://asianbonds
online.adb.org) provides up-to-date information on this
financial instrument. The information evidently meets a
need in the region: average daily visits were over 2,700
in the third quarter, 67% more than a year ago. November activity rose well above 2,800 visits per day, with
average visit length of over 18 minutes. ADB Institute’s
e-newsline is a free daily roundup of developmentrelated stories in Asia, reaching over 3,000 subscribers.

ADB also organized the 17th Tax Conference to
share country experiences on tax policy reforms and
discuss key issues in international and national taxation
in developing countries, such as transfer pricing and
value-added tax. Increased globalization of cross-border
economic transactions has resulted in a quickly rising
number of international tax treaties within the region as
well as with countries outside the region. Issues and best
practices related to avoidance of double taxation and
transfer pricing were therefore also discussed.

Over 600 participants registered for the 4th Microfinance Training of Trainers distance learning course.
This course helped build knowledge and capacity of
microfinance institutions in the Asia and Pacific region
by producing 133 certified microfinance trainers from 28
countries. It did so in partnership with the Tokyo Development Learning Center of the World Bank. The knowledge generated by this training has been widely used and
appreciated: training materials, for example, have now
been translated into both Chinese and Vietnamese.

The Asian Think Tanks: Strengthening Knowledge Management and Knowledge Sharing workshop
brought together 32 directors and senior managers of
the premier knowledge institutions from almost 20
ADB member countries. The workshop presented new
developments in knowledge management and knowledge sharing, and explored opportunities to achieve
greater policy impact for development in Asia. Presentations by knowledge management specialists and
a series of highly interactive group sessions enabled
participants to prepare prioritized action plans to
strengthen the knowledge management and knowledge-sharing approaches of their research institutes.

Other knowledge products may not be of such high
profile yet are equally influential in helping developingADB supports programs for knowledge

member countries make good policy and investment
decisions. A subset of the Statistical Database System
(SDBS), for example, which contains the key economic, social, and financial indicators of ADB’s developing member countries, was made accessible through
the Internet, free of charge. Since its launching, SDBS
Online (http://sdbs.adb.org) has already gained a wide
user base.

The Asia Regional Integration Center (ARIC) continued
to meet the region’s needs for up-to-date knowledge
and data. For example, the number of ARIC daily visitors (unique and not including ADB users) rose from
an average of 757 per day in the fourth quarter of
2006 to about 1,000 per day in the third quarter of
2007, or an increase of about 29%. Based on a random
survey of ARIC users conducted in March, more than
half were very satisfied or satisfied with ARIC, and
would rank ARIC better than if not the best among
the websites that they have visited so far. Other institutions, including the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) Secretariat and the Secretariat for
the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
have consulted ARIC regarding their plan to put up

Trade Organization and the Government of the Philippines the high-level Asia-Pacific regional review
meeting on Aid for Trade at ADB headquarters. This

edge about national and regional trade needs, established priorities and action plans, and secured political
commitment to follow through on the Aid for Trade
agenda in the region. Over 400 participants from the
Asia and Pacific region attended the Manila event,
including 2 heads of state, 10 ministers of finance or trade,
as well as senior-level representatives from international
organizations, the private sector, and funding agencies.

Other major conferences of note provided a platform for debating emerging development issues in the
region: the Evolving East Asian Financial Systems and
Challenges Ahead conference revisited how financial
and corporate sectors have been transformed and how
international flows of capital and trade have changed
in East Asia in the last decade, and the Learning from
the Asian Financial Crisis conference focused on the
current state of the crisis prevention mechanism within
the Asian regional framework, along with its plan.

ADB Institute and ADB headquarters jointly
launched the Flagship Study on Infrastructure and
Regional Cooperation, a study that will examine the
key issues and challenges facing cross-border infrastructure development in Asia in its ongoing efforts
to support regional cooperation. This study will serve
as a definitive knowledge product primarily for policy
makers in the region.

The Training Course on Free Trade Agreements
(FTAs) was designed to improve knowledge and skills
in this technically complex area and aims to enable
government officials in Asia to better understand complex economic, trade, legal, institutional, and other
policy issues related to FTAs. A total of 31 government
officials from 25 countries (plus the ASEAN Secretariat) participated in the second training course in July
while 35 officials from 29 countries participated in the
third training course in October. Participants gave the
training courses an overwhelmingly positive evaluation and said that they applied the skills acquired in
FTA negotiations.

In November, almost 50 senior officials from 23
ADB developing member countries participated in the

Workshop on Strengthening Private Sector Participation and Investment in Physical Infrastructure. The
workshop helped strengthen senior government officials’ insight into the main challenges to achieving
greater public-private partnerships for infrastructure
development across the Asia and Pacific region. The
participants discussed Asia’s economic performance
and its impact on demand for infrastructure services
and investment; trends and challenges for infrastructure financing and experiences with public-private
partnerships in the region, particularly those innovative approaches that could enhance the risk profile and
“bankability” of infrastructure projects; and priority
policy actions that need to be addressed by their governments to encourage greater private sector participation and investment in infrastructure development
programs in their countries.

Knowledge about Natural Resources
and the Environment

ADB made some major investments in knowledge
about natural resources and the environment: a critical
issue for a region increasingly concerned about climate
change and the sustainability of economic growth.

For example, the Asian Water Development Outlook
(AWDO) 2007 noted that the social, economic, and
environmental future of Asia will likely depend on
how efficiently and equitably water will be managed
in the coming years. AWDO 2007 is a forward-looking
assessment of the possible water future for the region,
where most of the poorest half of the world’s population lives.

Similarly, Toward Resource-Efficient Economies in
Asia and the Pacific: Highlights provides an overview
of resource inefficiency and its consequences in the
Asia and Pacific region; describes challenges and key
actions taken in the region; and identifies the role of
government in promoting the application of 3R principles—reduce, reuse, and recycle.

Energy for All: Addressing the Energy, Environment,
and Poverty Nexus in Asia notes that Asia faces the challenge of dealing with its growing energy needs and providing energy services to the vast number of the poor.
The paper discusses access to energy services for meeting daily living, work, and social needs for all, and suggests ways to sustainably develop the energy sector.

The ADB-supported “knowledge hubs” produce
an impressive program of knowledge and insights
that are useful to and usable by the public and private sectors alike in developing member countries. The
knowledge hubs involve specific, longer-term, research
and knowledge partnerships with partners throughout
the region.Annual Report 2007

89

 

One knowledge hub focuses on climate change and
is based at Tsinghua University in Beijing, PRC. Another
focuses on clean energy, and is based at The Energy
Research Institute (TERI) in New Delhi, India. A third
addresses the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) and is based in
the Asian Institute of Technology in Bangkok, Thailand.

These knowledge hubs generated and disseminated
some particularly useful and usable insights about climate change and the environment. For example, at the
ECO-Asia Asia and the Pacific environmental ministers forum held in September, the ministers welcomed
the activities of the 3R Knowledge Hub and identified
it as a useful mechanism in promoting 3R policies and
actions.

The ADB-TERI Knowledge Hub website on
renewable energy (www.aprekh.org), launched on 10
December at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change meeting in Bali, will serve as
a platform for knowledge sharing by various institutions, researchers, and users.

Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Climate
Change is an initiative managed by ADB. It focuses on
innovative solutions that would lead to widespread
commercial application of renewable and energy efficiency technologies and services or decrease greenhouse gas emissions.

MEETING INTERNAL NEEDS

ADB continued to invest significantly in knowledge
sharing within the organization. The knowledge management framework is now well in place. Eleven sector
and thematic committees or “communities of practice”
met throughout the year to ease cross-fertilization and
sharing of knowledge among specialists and among
and within disciplines. As just one example, the communities of practice on health and water met jointly to
exchange lessons.

Significant investment was made in IT and related
infrastructure to assist the creation, capturing, retrieval,
and use of knowledge. ADB rolled out “C-Cube,” an
electronic platform that enables staff to communicate,

coordinate, and collaborate electronically with each
other via e-meetings and in chat rooms. Important
progress was also made in having a single, electronically based document repository that will make documentation more accessible and usable.

There were numerous eminent speakers, training courses, and almost-daily “brown bag” seminars
where staff could learn and exchange latest insights on
development topics. In November, ADB hosted Social
Development Learning Week, which enabled staff—
including those at resident missions—to have focused
and systematic knowledge sharing on social development issues via formal training sessions, guest speakers, and brown bag seminars.

Independent evaluation and feedback mechanisms
are a foundation block of organizational learning.
Consequently, ADB’s Operations Evaluation Department (OED) published Independent Evaluation at the
Asian Development Bank (www.adb.org/Evaluation/documents/Independent-Evaluation/Independent-EvaluationADB.asp). This important document assesses the role
of lessons learned in development. Learning Lessons
in ADB (www.adb.org/Documents/Reports/LearningLessons-ADB/Strategic-Framework-2007-2009.asp)
articulates the strategic framework for better institutionalizing this approach. It set the stage for annual
knowledge audits to systematically identify and analyze knowledge needs, products and services, gaps,
flows, uses, and users from the perspective of learning
lessons. OED also conducted the first such knowledge
audit, elucidated in Auditing the Lessons Architecture
(www.adb.org/Documents/Studies/Auditing-LessonsArchitecture/IN37 1-07.asp).

The Operations Evaluation Department (OED) strives to
help ADB become a learning organization. OED is able
to do so because it is self-directed, avoids conflicts of
interest, is insulated from external influence, and is organizationally independent. Its work demonstrates that ADB
is prepared to be accountable for the results it produces.
OED now reports to the Board of Directors through the
Development Effectiveness Committee. (OED’s reports to
the committee are uploaded onto the ADB website at the
time they are submitted to the committee.) The change
has made evaluation a dedicated tool—governed by the
principles of usefulness, credibility, transparency, and
independence—for greater accountability and better development assistance (Enhancing the Independence and
Effectiveness of the Operations Evaluation Department
[www.adb.org/documents/policies/enhancing-oed.pdf}).

OED seeks to increase value added from its work.
The chapter Generating and Sharing Knowledge
(page 84) shows how ADB leverages operational and
developmental wisdom and increases learning. Backed
by perception surveys, OED also employs measures to
become more strategic, extend its outreach and respond
appropriately to client needs, measure success by value
added and not by number of reports produced, distinguish between types of recommendations and make
better recommendations, innovate in knowledge management, and be a more active global player in developing evaluation capacity and best practices.

CONDUCTING AND
DISSEMINATING STRATEGIC
EVALUATIONS

OED’s work program has shifted substantially from
evaluation of individual projects to broader and more
strategic studies. To select priority topics, OED consults with the Development Effectiveness Committee, Management, and the heads of departments and
offices. OED’s goals are to improve the quality of evaluations by using more robust methods; give priority
to country and sector assistance program evaluations;
increase the number of joint evaluations; validate selfevaluations to shorten the learning cycle; evaluate
development impact more rigorously; develop evaluation capacity, both in ADB and in developing member
countries; improve portfolio performance; evaluate
business processes; and circulate findings and recommendations and see to it that these are carried out.
Influential evaluation studies in 2007 dealt with
indigenous peoples safeguards; performance of technical
assistance; private sector development and operations;
ADB’s energy policy; projects cofinanced by ADB and
the Global Environment Facility; ADB’s Japan Funds;

OED is a member of the Evaluation Cooperation
Group (ECG), a community of practice organized in
1996 by the heads of evaluation of multilateral development banks to strengthen the use of evaluation for
more effective and accountable development lending;
share and spread lessons from evaluations; harmonize
evaluation criteria, methods, and approaches; enhance
professionalism and collaboration among their members; and pave the way for borrowing member countries to build their capacity to perform evaluations.

The Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
promotes the adoption of knowledge management
concepts used in the corporate sector:

* Concentration. ADB’s work plan has country,
sector, and thematic areas of concentration.

* Learning. To become a learning organization,
ADB is restructuring its management information
systems. OED has leveraged its greater institutional independence and assigned more resources
to knowledge management to better support
learning.

* Quality of evaluation. OED’s more sophisticated
methods, increased orientation toward impact
assessment, and broader evaluations suggest
that more knowledge is being created and used
to reinforce the concepts and quality of development and to increase external accountability. The
quality of the lessons identified and the recommendations made must constantly improve.

* Feedback. With OED’s help, the feedback system
for evaluation-based learning and accountability
is being systematized and institutionalized.

* Information and documentation. ADB is making increasing use of modern, Internet-based
information and documentation systems, which
cut information-gathering and search costs and
strengthen institutional memory. But the systems
could be made more functional, especially given
the rising flood of data and information. ADB is
networking the systems and encouraging upward
feedback in a decentralized organization. OED
manages the evaluation pages on ADB’s website
for better functionality, design, content, originality, professionalism, and effectiveness.

¢ Internalization. OED is looking into the possibility of using a more systematic and innovative
way of internalizing lessons from evaluation in
an overall strategic framework for knowledge
management.

Monitoring. OED promotes the monitoring of
actions taken on evaluation findings and recommendations, using well-established monitoring
and evaluation systems.

Disclosure. Evaluation approach papers and the
comments of external stakeholders are posted on
the evaluation pages on ADB's website.

Partners and stakeholders. ADB largely directs
feedback to internal audiences, but increasingly
recognizes the need for more active participation
by in-country partners and stakeholders, including the media.

Broad-based evaluations. OED continues to
move from individual project evaluation to a
broader country, sector, and thematic focus,
increasing the potential impact of evaluation,
especially when it is timed to coincide with policy review. Findings and recommendations from
broad-based evaluations feed in straightforward
fashion into ongoing projects, given the existence of relatively well-established monitoring
and evaluation systems; if not, challenges present
themselves.

Self-evaluation. OED’s advocacy and support
for better self-evaluation by units responsible for
programs and activities have encouraged better
design and monitoring frameworks, monitoring
and evaluation systems, and completion reports.

Growing interest in developing member countries (DMCs). ADB now places a higher premium
on achieving results and helps DMCs strengthen
their abilities to measure and manage for results.
DMCs themselves are showing greater interest in
developing their evaluation capacity, as reflected
in stronger demand for knowledge products and
services from the International Program for Development Evaluation Training, and in the growth
of evaluation associations.

Policy-based lending, known as program lending
in ADB, was introduced to ease the balance-ofpayments difficulties of developing member
countries. Over the last 30 years, it has also helped
improve incentives, enabling environments and
institutions, and more recently public resource
management. At the end of 2006, program lending had taken up 24% of ADB's total public sector
lending. Does experience disclose good practices?

NOLLVATWAS LNJGNAd3 GNIThe quality of ADB’s service can be only as good
as the quality of its people and of their working
environment. Over the past year, major steps

were taken to secure this outcome. Following
President Kuroda’s emphasis on the importance of
better human resource management in improving
institutional effectiveness, ADB mainstreamed
reforms in staff recruitment, performance, learning
and development, and compensation.97

 

Savings were sought and achieved in ADB’s internal operations, both through conservation and costreduction measures and through the use of more
advanced technology. While facilitating access to its
documents and databases, ADB also improved its
security systems.

Measures were taken to address the possibility
of fraud, corruption, and abuse in ADB-funded projects and operations. Independent and comprehensive
audits were undertaken to maintain the highest level
of professional integrity and performance in ADB and
compliance with established rules and regulations.

HUMAN RESOURCES

The human resource strategy is in its third and final
year of implementation. Many of the envisaged actions
under the strategy, a key element of ADB’s reform
agenda, have been completed and have become part
of ADB’s human resource management and administration. The strategy commits ADB to improving
the effectiveness of its human capital, to introducing
a new performance management and rewards system,
and to improving leadership throughout ADB.

Recruitment and selection improved in quality
and timeliness with reduced average hiring time and
more focus in strategic recruitment on achieving the
necessary skills mix. After a skills-mix assessment, job
descriptions were updated to integrate skills requirements and competencies.

Consultations with and feedback from staff led
to an improved, streamlined, and automated performance and development plan. Staff consider performance management important and recognize the plan
as a useful tool for distinguishing performance.

A total of 2,633 staff members took part in
110 learning programs, which were delivered in
177 sessions. A total of 7,175 person-days were spent
in learning and development programs aligned with
ADB’s business strategies and designed to strengthen
staff capacity and leadership effectiveness.

The curriculum approach to learning was further developed for four key learning tracks: leadership, managing for development results, operational
and business processes, and financial management.
Technology was key in developing an online leadership
program survey for heads of divisions, a learning and
development plan for staff in the online performance
and development plan, and an interactive learning and
development website.

ADB established a systematic talent management
process to identify and develop staff with leadership
potential. The first two sessions of the assessment and
development center were completed and three more
are scheduled for 2008.

Planning for the staff engagement survey started
with the selection of an external expert to develop,
design, and implement the survey. External experts will
also assist in a comprehensive review of the human
resource strategy in the second half of 2008.

STAFFING

ADB’s staff on board as of 31 December 2007 totaled
2,443 from 55 of its 67 members: 5 members of Management, and 847 professional and 1,591 local staff,
of whom 479, or about 19.6%, were in field offices.
Appointments and departures numbered 1 each in
Management, 99 and 108 among professional staff,
and 159 and 112 among local staff. Women accounted
for 29% of the professional staff.

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

Consistent with ADB’s market-based compensation
system, the Board approved a 4.1% weighted average
increase in the professional staff salary structure, which
took effect on 1 January 2008. The Board also approved
a 4.7% salary budget increase, 4.1% of which will be
used for performance-related salary increases and the
rest for performance bonuses. The Board also approved
a weighted average increase of 8.9% for national officers and administrative staff at headquarters for 2008.
The overall weighted average increase in 25 field offices
is 13.6%.

As part of the cost-containment measures for the
Group Medical Insurance Plan, the generics drug program, which provides full reimbursement for generic
drugs purchased in the Philippines, was expanded to
include purchases made in the US and other developed countries.

Benefits administration underwent several improvements. The compensation and benefits website now
provides life event information. Alerts to staff remind
them to keep staff information up-to-date and provide
automatic reminders and comprehensive information
about important matters. The enhanced fee structure
for duty-station school education significantly simplified application processing. The online application
and approval of leave, which became fully operational
throughout ADB in November, increased efficiency
by eliminating paper applications, improving data

INTERNAL ADMINISTRATIVE
EXPENSES

Internal administrative expenses totaled $325.5 million, compared with the original budget of $332.9
million. Despite the continuing appreciation of the
Philippine peso against the US dollar, the overruns in
certain budget items in the operational and administrative budget categories were fully met through
reallocations from savings within the same budget
categories. The decrease in staff costs was offset by
increases caused by the appreciation of the Philippine
peso, higher staff consultant requirements arising from
new initiatives, and business travel for various activities, such as responding to emergencies in developing
member countries.

For 2008, the net internal administrative expenses
budget is $357.2 million. The increase over the 2007
budget reflects a price growth of 6.1% and a volume
growth of 1.2%. About $5.2 million is expected to be
recoverable from administering trust funds of multilateral and bilateral institutions.

The 2008 budget also includes an annual capital
budget of $4.1 million, mainly to fund cyclical capital
expenditures for headquarters facilities and information technology equipment, and to meet the replacement and acquisition requirements of field offices.

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES

The Office of Administrative Services reinforced overall service delivery and efficiencies through improvements in business processes and in workplace safety
and environment, cost reduction, and automation.

Business process improvements resulted in better
responsiveness and savings in staff resources in addition to hard and soft savings of up to $700,000.

The office sustained its conservation and environmental initiatives and received ISO 14001 and OSHAS
18001 recertification in December. Savings in paper,
water, and electricity use totaled about $100,000, an
amount that was partly offset by increases in utility
costs. The office also focused on reducing ADB’s corporate footprint and conducted its first greenhouse gas
inventory in November.

As a knowledge management center, the office
gives advice and guidance on information gathering
and packaging during project cycles. It launched its
Events Management Unit in November to take on all
conferences, seminars, and workshops held at ADB
headquarters starting July 2008.

 

Six Sigma training helped staff maintain quality service

In July, the office leased property for the new
business continuity facility. Construction began in
December and full operation of the facility is expected
by October 2008. The office continued to undertake
building rehabilitation and restoration projects to preserve and improve the ADB headquarters building.

The office further reviewed ADB’s security services
and systems. It introduced a new identification system,
and developed a mechanism to continuously inform
staff, including those at the resident missions, about
security concerns and issues.

OFFICE OF INFORMATION
SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY

The Office of Information Systems and Technology
made great strides in enhancing ADB’s information
technology (IT) services, giving clients better access to
knowledge and information anywhere and anytime.

The office progressed in developing the project processing portfolio management (P3M) project, to be completed in mid-2009. P3M offers an integrated IT solution
for managing projects, from country partnership strategy to post evaluation. The eSTAR (electronic storage
and retrieval system) facilitates access to documents.
The management information system executive dashboard, launched by the office, draws information from
existing databases to simplify management reporting.

Two IT governance committees were created
to align IT with ADB’s business goals. The Portfolio
Management Unit (IT-PMU) manages the IT portfolio and provides status reporting. The Investment
Working Group, chaired by the IT-PMU, reviews
client business cases and ensures overall fiscal and
technology accountability.

The Customer Support Group was formed to
provide a direct line of communication and productivity tools to client groups. It deployed new com-Annual Report 2007

puters and installed a web-based IT service request
system, an upgraded help desk, and an online IT service catalog.

Field offices received server upgrades, additional
videoconference facilities, more efficient links, and
provisions for local Internet access. A high-level information and data security risk assessment was completed to identify and mitigate IT-related risks. The
offsite backup facilities of the office were enhanced to
include ADB’s high-priority systems. Administrative
Order 4.05, governing the delivery and security of IT
resources and data, was approved by Management.

To strengthen internal controls for financial reporting and attestation, the office continued adopting the
COBIT and ITIL frameworks for IT governance by
training and certifying 50 staff members.

The office implemented a new mainframe computer and migrated data and applications, besides
upgrading Oracle and SWIFT applications.

OFFICE OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL
Integrity Division

The division addressed allegations of corruption and
fraud in ADB activities, conducted staff workshops and
training, and worked with national audit institutions of
developing member countries (DMCs) in project procurement-trelated audits. The division also conducted
regional anticorruption seminars in Beijing and Jakarta
for participants from 21 DMCs to increase awareness
of and compliance with ADB’s anticorruption policy
and integrity principles and guidelines among borrowers and executing agencies, and the capacity to detect
and prevent fraud and corruption.

ADB barred 61 firms and 48 individuals from participating in ADB-financed activities as a result of the
division’s investigations. As of 31 December, 398 firms
and individuals had been declared ineligible. During
the year, the division received 211 complaints, of which
11% were about ADB staff. It referred findings on
10 staff cases to ADB’s Budget, Personnel, and Management Systems Department for further action.

The division conducted five project procurementrelated audits to reduce weaknesses that may allow
fraud, corruption, or abuse in ADB-financed projects.
The supreme audit institutions of borrower countries
took part in some of these audits, reinforcing ADB’s
ability to share this audit knowledge and support
capacity development.

The division continues to coordinate with the
Joint International Financial Institutions Anticorruption Task Force on matters of mutual interest.

Financial, Administrative, and Information
Systems Division

The division conducted independent audits of ADB’s
operations; its information systems; and its financial,
accounting, and administrative processes. These audits
helped strengthen internal controls and risk management; compliance with ADB policies, procedures, and
regulations; and effectiveness, efficiencies, and economy in finance, operations, and IT. The office worked
with PricewaterhouseCoopers, ADB’s external auditors, to properly coordinate required audit activities.

The office completed 25 audits, including financial, administrative, and operational audits of resident
missions, representative offices, and the Asian Development Bank Institute. Loan and technical assistance
portfolios of selected headquarters divisions were
reviewed for compliance with established rules and
regulations. Information systems reviews covered telecommunications, the independent verification and validation of the development of several IT applications,
data security of ADB’s network, and disaster recovery
testing of critical systems.

The office also reviewed selected borrowing, loan
disbursement, and administrative expense transactions.
Several consultant contracts were audited to check the
authenticity of consultant claims. Eight internal audit
certifications were issued to funding agencies of trust
or grant funds at the request of the Office of Cofinancing Operations. Activities of the Office of Administrative Services, such as library management and office
supplies, were reviewed.

To ensure that the findings were being acted on,
the division regularly monitored the progress of outstanding audit recommendations.

ADB barred 61 firms and 48
individuals from participating
in ADB-financed activities,
and conducted five project
procurement-related audits
to reduce weaknesses that
may allow fraud, corruption,
or abuse in ADB-financed
projects

® Transfers were made between budget items without exceeding the original amount of each category. An amount of $553,000 was transferred from the general contingency to meet the
overrun in the budget category of Board of Directors: offices of the directors.

Excludes the following items reconciling with financial statements in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles: (i) provisions for future liabilities with respect to severance

pay ($261,000); (ii) accumulated compensated absences ($232,000), and accrued resettlement or repatriation allowances (-$54,000); (iii) adjustments of actuarially determined assess
ment of benefit obligations with respect to pension costs ($7,010,000) and postretirement medical benefits ($12,547,000); (iv) expenses related to the enhanced separation program

($30,000); and (v) adjustments related to the Afghanistan Resident Mission Guest House ($78,000). Total administrative expenses, as shown in the financial statements, amounted to

$349,144,000. This amount, after deducting $1,341,000 directly charged to Japan Special Fund ($1,246,000) and Japan Scholarship Program ($95,000), has been distributed as follows

OCR - $127,327,000 (Ref. OCR-2) net of $34,080,000 as front-end fee offset against loan origination costs and recognized as a reduction in administrative expenses; ADF - $186,396,000

(Ref. ADF-2).

This amount ($4,067,000) reflects the estimated total expenses apportioned for administering the trust funds during the year.

In 2006, the Board approved introduction of a budget carryover into the following fiscal year of up to 2% of net IAE, beginning with the 2007 budget. Accordingly, $6.7 million (2% of

the 2007 net IAE budget) has been carried over to 2008.

operations. In addition, large numbers of technical assistance and regional technical assistance reports generated and disseminated knowledge. In addition to that extensive work, the four designated Knowledge Departments—Asian Development Bank Institute, Economics and Research Department,
Office of Regional Economic Integration, and Regional and Sustainable Development Department, together with Operations Evaluation Department,
produced the following products in 2007:

GLOSSARY

B-loan. A tranche of a direct loan nominally advanced by
ADB, subject to eligible financial institutions’ taking funded
risk participations within such a tranche and without recourse
to ADB. It complements an A-loan funded by ADB.

Direct value-added cofinancing. Cofinancing with active coordination and formal agreements among financing partners
that bring about defined client benefits, including contractual
commitments by ADB (such as for credit enhancement, syndication, or financial administration) to facilitate mobilization,
administration, or participation in cofinancing.

Loans at risk. Loans rated as unsatisfactory or partly satisfactory for impact and outcomes or implementation progress as
articulated in the design and monitoring framework or those
that might slip into those categories.

Multitranche financing facility. A debt-financing facility to
target discrete, sequential components of large stand-alone
projects; slices (or tranches) of sector investment programs
over a longer time frame than the current norm; financial
intermediary credit lines; and guarantees.

Sovereign/nonsovereign. ADB lending is classified as sovereign and nonsovereign. A sovereign loan is guaranteed by the
national government, while a nonsovereign loan is not guaranteed by the national government. Nonsovereign operations
refer to an ADB-financed transaction with a subsovereign,
state-owned enterprise, other public private entity, or private
sector entity as obligor or investee, normally without direct
sovereign indemnity. In 2007, ADB's nonsovereign operations
supported the infrastructure, capital market, and banking sectors, among others.

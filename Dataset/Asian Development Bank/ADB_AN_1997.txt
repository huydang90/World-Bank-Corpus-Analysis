EEN NINET Y-SEVENwasa year of massive, unanticipated
turbulence for the newly industrialized economies (NIEs) and
Southeast Asia’s currency and stock markets. Asia’s economic

progress was set back significantly by precipitous falls in the values of
currencies and stock markets that began in mid-1997. The repercussions
of these disturbances are still being felt throughout the region and beyond.
For most of the Bank’s members in Asia, particularly in some of the NIEs
and Southeast Asian countries, the rate of economic growth fell in 1997
in relation to previous years. The outlook for 1998 has had to be revised.
downward sharply, not only for the afflicted economies, but for other
economies of Asia as well. While the brunt of adjustment is likely to be
felt in 1998 — some economies will actuallycontract — it maybe several
years before normal growth patterns reappear. The social costs of the
“contagion” could be very high.

From mid-1997, the Bank monitored the rapidly unfolding situation
of the region and determined appropriate Bank responses. It liaised closely
with its member countries, the International Monetary Fund, the World
Bank, and bilateral donors to develop its interventions. These efforts
culminated in program loans to the Republic of Korea and Thailand, and
a pledge of assistance to Indonesia. The loan to the Republic of Korea
was the Bank’s first to this country since 1988. These loans illustrated the
Bank’s ability to respond rapidly to the needs of the region.

The financial sector loans to the Republic of Korea and Thailand,
both from the Bank’s ordinary capital resources (OCR), boosted total
Bank lending for the year to $9.4 billion, nearly $4 billion more than
lending in 1996. Asa result, the financial sector received nearly50 percent
of total lending,

While these extraordinary developments headed its agenda during
the second half of the year, the Bank continued throughout the year with
its normal country-based loan, technical assistance, and advisory operations. In these it continued to be guided by the strategic priorities identified in its Medium-T erm Strategic Framework (MTSF) (1995-1998). The
Bank again strove to meet five strategic objectives: promoting economic
growth, reducing poverty, supporting human development, improving the
status of women, and protecting the environment. It continued to consolidate its position as a broad-based development institution and not just
a project financier.

In terms of number of loans, more than 60 percent were for social,
environment, or growth-oriented purposes, well above the Banktarget of
50 percent.ANNUAL REPORT 1997

Events later in the year overshadowed some otherwise significant
events in the life of the Bank. Notable among them was the review of
technical assistance operations, resulting in some changes in both emphasis and practice. The most important is the intention to take a longerterm perspective in technical assistance work and to forge continuing
partnerships with developing member country (DMC) agencies.

The Bank took several steps in 1997 toward establishing a workable
set of indicators to measure both its own performance and that of its
members. The Project Performance Management System was piloted and
the Project Performance Report System was introduced.

Negotiations were concluded at a donors’ meeting in January on the
sixth replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (ADF). The agreement, amounting to contributions from donors and OCR totaling

Operations

Cumulative Bank lending since the Bank's inception to the end of 1997
amounted to $71.6 billion for 1,448 projects in 35 DMCs. Cumulative
equity investments and underwriting since the Bank’s private sector
operations started in 1983 amounted to $563 million for 105 projects.

Lending: T otal lending in 1997 comprising public as well as private
sector operations amounted to $9,414 million (including loans of
$4.015 billion to the Republic of Korea) for 75 projects, compared
with the previous year’s level of $5,545.1 million for 83 projects. This
reflected an increase of about 70 percent in dollar amount anda
decrease of 9.6 percent in number. Loans from OCR increased by
101 percent to $7,794.4 million, while concessional loans from ADF
decreased by 2.8 percent to $1,619.6 million.

Excluding the $4,015 million loans to the Republic of Korea, total

The 75 projects that received loans (or a combination of loan and equity

about $16.2 billion. Bank financing of these projects in loans and equities
amounted to $9.4 billion or 58 percent of the cost. Borrowers, governments, or both provided $3.2 billion or 20 percent. About $2.6 billion or
16 percent were financed through cofinancing from official and commercial sources, equity sponsors, and local financial institutions. Project
beneficiaries and subborrowers provided about $1 billion or 6 percent of
the total project cost.

Review of operations

Lending to the public and private sectors during 1997 increased in dollar
amount by70 percent, while the number of loans decreased to 91 from
92 in the previous year. The rise was mainly due to the extraordinarily
large Financial Sector Reform Program loan to the Republic of Korea, and
an increase in the number of sector development program loans under the
new program lending modality approved in 1996.Overview

The Financial Crisis in Developing Asia

HE MOST significant event in the world economy in 1997 was

the financial crisis that affected much of Asia. The crisis began in
Thailand in July 1997 when the value of the Thai baht plummeted, following
the abandonment of the country’s pegged exchange rate system. This crisis,
which began asa currency crisis, spread and engulfed Indonesia, Republic of
Korea, Malaysia, and Philippines by the end of 1997. The currencies of these
countries depreciated sharply, bringing with them downward pressures on
other currencies perceived to be vulnerable, not only in Asia but around the
world. The financial crisis was reflected in the collapse in stock markets, and
the poor health of bank and nonbank financial institution portfolios. The
speed of the crisis took everyone by surprise. Even those skeptics who argued
that the claims of an Asian economic miracle were overstated had not
expected such a precipitous collapse.

From the end of June through the end of December 1997, the nominal
exchange rate (dollar price of the local currency) depreciated significantly
across the most affected countries. The Indonesian rupiah depreciated by
about 80 percent; the Thai baht by about 50 percent; and the Korean won,
Malaysian ringgit, and the Philippine peso by about 40 percent each. In
hindsight, it can be seen that deterioration in investor confidence preceded
the currency crisis. Stock markets in Thailand and the Republic of Korea had
been under pressure since the beginning of 1996. In Malaysia and the
Philippines, the pressure began in early 1997, and stock prices declined by
about 50 percent and 60 percent, respectively, in local currency terms. In
Indonesia, the stock market remained buoyant during the early part of the
year, but with the onset of the currency crisis it declined sharply (about
80 percent).

This crisis was not limited to individual countries but spread across the
region. The contagion effect of the crisis has been felt, to varying extents, not only
inneighboring countries but also in financial markets as far away as Australia and
New Zealand. The Singapore dollar depreciated by 40 percent, the Lao kipby
about 19 percent, and the Indian and Pakistani rupees byabout 10 percent
from end-June to end-December. However, despite speculative attacks ona
number of occasions and a sharp fall in the Hang Seng index by about
33 percent from its August peak, the Hong Kong dollar has remained firm.

While globalization rapidly brought substantial benefits to developing
Asia, it also heightened the risks associated with failing to address inappropriate policies, weaknesses in financial sector institutions, and problems in
corporate and public governance. The economies most affected by the crisis
displayed relatively few vulnerabilities in their macroeconomic indicators,
but a significant warning signal was there in the large and growing current
account deficits in Malaysia and Thailand. During 1990-1996, the current
account deficit to GDP ratio averaged 7 percent in Thailand and 6.3 percent
in Malaysia. The current account deficits were somewhat lower in the
Philippines (averaging 4 percent), Indonesia (2.8 percent), and Republic of
Korea (1.7 percent).

These current account deficits were partly caused by structural changes
in the “real” side of these economies and partly by appreciation of their real
exchange rates. In recent years, countries such as Malaysia and Thailand
have faced an erosion in their competitiveness in labor-intensive products
vis-a-vis lower-wage Asian competitor countries. In 1996, an export slow-Overview

 

down was compounded bya sharp cyclical decline in the demand for semiconductors and other electronic products (as well as slower growth of world
trade compared with previous years). In addition to the export slowdown, an
increase in imports due to appreciation of the real exchange rates also caused
increases in the current account deficits in the countries most affected by the
crisis. During the period June 1995 to June 1997, the real exchange rate
appreciated by 21 percent for the Philippines, 14 percent for Thailand, and
12 percent for Indonesia and Malaysia. The Republic of Korea also experienced some appreciation but only bya modest 1.5 percent.

The combination of increased current account deficits and rising real
exchange rates was sustained by private capital flows from abroad. Since the
late 1980s, many Asian developing economies have experienced surges in
capital inflows. Aside from the PRC, the surges were largest in the countries
that later experienced the strongest effects of the crisis. On a cumulative basis
from 1987 through 1996, the Republic of Korea received $80 billion, Thailand
$75 billion, Indonesia and Malaysia $68 billion each, and the Philippines
$23 billion. These inflows were nearly 12 percent of GDP per annum on
average in Malaysia, followed by 7.4 percent in Thailand, 5.7 percent in
Indonesia, 5.1 percent in the Republic of Korea, and 4.3 percent in the
Philippines. Only a small fraction of this flow came in the form of foreign
direct investment; the remainder was either through portfolio investment or
through the banking sector.

Once the surge of private capital inflows started — partly driven by the
fundamentals of these economies and partly driven by the speculative tendencies of investors — a rampant increase in domestic asset prices ensued.
This rise in asset prices, which increases returns to capital, in turn induced
further capital inflows and by mid-1996, private capital

 

flows into these countries had reached an all-time high.

 

The surge of private foreign capital brought about
imbalancesin the banking sector of the five most affected
countries (Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia,
Philippines, and Thailand). First, the foreign liabilities
of the commercial banks between 1993 and 1996 increased by about 12 percent per annum while foreign
assets increased by only about 7 percent per annum. In
contrast, in the less-affected Asian developing economies, such as Hong Kong, China; Singapore; and
Taipei,China, foreign assets of the banking sector increased at the same rate as foreign liabilities and the net
foreign debt position remained virtually unchanged.
Second, much of the collateral which the banking sector
accepted for loans was real estate and equities, assets

 

Picture no. 13

 

 

 

whose prices contained a large “bubble” element. Finally,

 

 

there was an imbalance in the maturity structure of assets
and liabilities of the banks. As much of the capital inflow was short term, they
were borrowing short and lending long.

Some financial institutions — such as the Thai finance companies and
Korean banks — reflected an implicit belief that their financial liabilities
were guaranteed by their respective governments. This implicit guarantee
was visible in the strong political connections of the ownership of these

Asian economies.ANNUAL REPORT 1997

 

institutions and government assistance in times of financial distress. In addition, these financial entities were subject to nontransparent and lax regulatory enforcement. In the context of surging capital inflows, implicit government
guarantees to creditors encouraged excessive risk-taking, raised investors’

overoptimism, and allowed loan quality to deteriorate.

 

Picture no. 28

The implicit belief that effectively fixed exchange rates
would be maintained indefinitely also discouraged the
prudent hedging of foreign liabilities.

The financial institutions of affected countries were
ill equipped to deal with globalization’s sudden surges in
capital flows, and with the frenetic pace of economic
activity during their period of rapid growth. Poorly regulated banks channeled funds from savers to investors in
an inefficient manner, encouraged by rising asset prices.
Standards of loan appraisal and portfolio management
were generally inadequate, and weak or poorly enforced
disclosure requirements deterred accurate information.
from coming to light. Thus, while saving was generally
high, it often was not invested most productively. As
returns began to disappoint investors, their irrational

 

 

exuberance faded rapidly. The five economies most

 

Capital market development
has received priority to
facilitate long-term domestic
debt financing tomeet critical
infrastructural needs.

adversely affected by the crisis recorded an aggregate
net foreign capital outflow of $12 billion in 1997, compared with aggregate
net inflow of $93 billion in 1996, according to the Institute of International
Finance. The value of currencies began to plummet and interest rates to
skyrocket in these countries. High, unhedged debt-to-equity ratios, which
had been a boon in better times, began to imperil company finances and those
of the financial institutions which had lent to them.

As the crisis deepened and broadened, international institutions responded rapidly. The different dimensions of the crisis (for example, banking
failures in the Republic of Korea and Thailand, and corporate failures in
Indonesia) called for differing focuses in each country. In coordination with
other multilateral financial institutions, the Bank, for example, approved a
$300 million financial markets reform program loan for Thailand. The program was designed to (i) strengthen market regulation and supervision; (ii)
improve risk management; (iii) facilitate investor access to domestic financial
markets; and (iv) develop long-term institutional sources of funds by promoting an integrated system of pension and provident funds.

In the Republic of Korea, the Bank approved a $4 billion program loan
for financial sector reforms in three major areas: (i) capacity building ofOverview

 

banking and nonbank financial institutions; (ii) building financial market
infrastructures; and (iii) improving corporate accounting and disclosure
standards. This is the Bank’s largest single loan ever. In addition, a technical
assistance loan of $15 million was negotiated with the Korean Government
to (i) create a Financial Supervisory Agency; (ii) assist the Korea Asset
Management Corporation in managing nonperforming loans of commercial
and merchant banks; (iii) strengthen credit rating agencies, and (iv) create a
special purpose vehicle for a mortgage-backed securities market.

In Indonesia, the Bank has been working on a $1.5 billion capital market
reform program to improve regulatory and supervisory functions, develop the
fixed income securities and financial derivatives markets, and strengthen the
institutional capability of contractual savings institutions. In addition, the
Bank is expected to become involved with restructuring the banking system,
focusing on private national banks and regional development banks.

The Republic of Korea and most of Southeast Asia are now undergoing
wrenching macroeconomic and sectoral adjustments, but the implications for
real economic activity, as opposed to the financial sector, are only gradually
being revealed. The social consequences of the crisis are likely to be serious.
Many of those least able to protect themselves, such as migrant workers, will
be among those most severely affected. The expectations of many of Asia’s
emerging middle class have also suffered. Social safety nets, which are weak
or poorly developed in many places, are coming under increasing stress. The
Bank will continue to assist its developing members to address such difficulties.

Notwithstanding the current crisis, the longer-term outlook for the region
is far from bleak. Human capacities have not been destroyed, social and
physical infrastructure remain largely intact, and there hasbeen a strengthening
of policies and institutional structures that promote openness and macroeconomic stability. The capacity for resource mobilization (savings rates exceed
30 percent), reasonably good infrastructure, favorable demographics, an open
trading system, anda general commitment to macroeconomic prudence — all
these factors should stimulate growth. In time, structural weaknesses in
financial systems can and will be rectified, more efficient capital markets will
evolve, and foreign capital will return.

Economic growth will resume once appropriate adjustment policies are
implemented and take effect. However, fast growth in Asia is unlikely to
resume quickly. The necessary institutional responses to the crisis cannot be
implemented overnight. For some economies, the road back may be longer
than for others, but provided policy corrections are made and institutional
reforms carried through, the foundations which propelled fast growth in the
past should once again come to the fore.ANNUAL REPORT 1997

responding quickly and yet effectively to the “contagion” that
swept through many financial markets of Asia in the latter part
of the year. The Bank, acting in concert with other development organizations, responded by offering both financial and technical assistance. The
strategy of a rapid and innovative response to the financial turmoil underscored the Bank’s capacity asa broad-based development institution.
The Board, in addition to discharging its normal oversight role in
respect to loan and technical assistance activities, continued to promote
increased effectiveness, efficiency, and quality throughout the organization. These initiatives included the approval of new and revised policies
and the revision of existing strategies.

D URING 1997, the Board of Directors confronted the challenge of

General operations

In 1997, the Board met formally on 48 occasions (including executive
sessions) and approved total lending of $9,414 million for 75 projects.
This amount represents loans of $7,794.4 million from ordinary capital
resources (OCR) and $1,619.6 million from the Asian Development Fund
(ADE). Equityinvestments totaled $74.3 million. Government-guaranteed
loans were approved for 73 projects, with an average project size of approximately $61 million over the total loan portfolio. (For purposes of
comparability with prior years’ analyses, the average project size excludes
from the calculation the Financial Sector Program loan and institutional
strengthening technical assistance loan to the Republic of Korea totaling
$4.015 billion, asthisamount represents 43 percent of total Bank lending
for 1997.)

Twenty-four countries received Bank loans in 1997, including the
Republic of Korea which returned as a borrower after ten years’ absence.

Inaddition to loans, the Board, either directly or through the delegated
authority vested in the President by the Board, approved 298 technical
assistance grants totaling $162.5 million.

In addition to being fully in compliance with its policies, any loan,
technical assistance, or equity investment extended by the Bank must also
satisfy the Bank’sstrategic objectives. The strategic objectives are defined
by reference to the following forms of intervention: economic growth,
poverty reduction, human development, gender equity, and environmental protection.

The Board, in addition to the formal meetings, held five seminars and
informal discussions. As in previous years, the agenda on these occasions
covered a range of diverse matters, including the yearly review of the
Bank's Three-Year W ork Program and Budget Framework (1998-2000),

The Boards and Their Functions

HE BANK is governed by a Board of

Governors, which, at the end of 1997,
consisted of 56 members representing 40 regional and 16 nonregional. Under Article 28
of the Bank’s Charter, the Board of Governors
is vested with all the powers of the Bank. In
turn, the Governors delegate their authority
to the Board of Directors, except for certain
powers reserved to them under the Charter.

The Board of Governors meets formally
once a year for the Bank’s Annual Meeting.

The resolutions approved by the Board
of Governors during 1997 and its membership are shown in Appendixes 1 and 2,
respectively.

Also under Article 28, the Board of
Governors elects a 12-member Board of
Directors, eight elected by regional members
and four by nonregional members. Each
Director appoints an Alternate. The President
of the Bank is the Chairperson of the Board
of Directors.

The Board of Directors performs its duties
ona full-time basis at the Bank’s Headquarters
in Manila, Philippines, and meets in regular
formal and executive sessions which the
President chairs. The Directors exercise their
authority and functions through their quarterly
and annual supervision of the Bank’s financial statements, their annual approval of the
Bank’s administrative budget, and their continuous review and approval of policy documents and all loan, equity, and technical
assistance operations.

The Directors and the members they
represent are shown in Appendix 3.

Policy issues

During 1997, the Board considered and approved a number of major
policy initiatives designed to improve the social and economic impacts of
Bank interventions in its developing member countries (DMCs) or to
enhance the internal effectiveness of the Bank in delivering its services.
This approach of continuous review and improvement is consistent with
the process of quality management, and forms part of the Bank’s overall
framework designed to ensure the continuing responsiveness of the organization to the needs of its DMCs.

Operational policy development - technical assistance operations: In 1997, the Board reviewed the Bank’s technical assistance operations, noting that technical assistance plays an essential role in the
Bank’s efforts to achieve its development impact. The importance of
technical assistance in Bank operations is highlighted in this year’s special
theme chapter, which addresses many of the points raised by the Board
in their review.

Internal policy development — review of the financial planning
framework for the management of ADF resources: In January 1997,
the Bank and donors agreed in T okyo to replenish the ADB’s soft loan
facility, the ADF, with $6.3 billion. This replenishment will cover the
four-year period from 1997 to 2000.

The resources mobilized for ADF VII will allowthe Bank to continue
to provide important financing for the priority investment needs in the
poorer DMCs. As part of the negotiations, the Bank has agreed to review
various policies, including its financial policy, the issue of graduation, and
ADF lending terms during the ADF VII period.

The Bank’s new financial planning framework will maximize efficiency in the use of resources other than donor contributions to the
current replenishment to increase the ADF commitment authority.

Review of the Bank’s income and reserves policy: The Board
reviewed and approved the Income and Reserves Policy, which hasasits
major recommendations that the Bank adopt a long-term minimum policy
objective for the interest coverage ratio, establish a planning goal of about
25 percent for the reserve:loan ratio, effect a medium-term plan to reduce
the actual reserve:loan ratio, use the surplus account in the annual income planning process, give priorityin the allocation of excessnet income
to the Technical Assistance Special Fund and then to the ADF, and
maintain the Bank’s current policy of funding liquidity with equity.

Institutional development — Asian Development Bank Institute:
In December 1997, the ADB Institute was officially inaugurated in T okyo.
The Institute has been structured asa development “think tank” andaThe Board of Directors

 

high-level training center. It will carry out innovative development research and provide management training for top-level policymakers and
officials of public and private development institutions from the Bank’s
DMCs. The Institute will examine critical issues affecting the development of the Asian and Pacific region and, through this process, create a
knowledge and information database around and upon which future development strategies for DMCs can be identified and structured. The
Institute will offer not onlyinnovative approaches to development interventions but also practical advice on howsuch approaches can be implemented and, hence, the importance the institution attaches to applied
research and training, The Institute will be fully financed bythe Government
ofJapan.

Institutional representation — resident missions. T he Boardagreed
to the opening of three resident missions, two in the Central Asian
republics (Kazakstan and Uzbekistan), and one in Sri Lanka. These missions will assist in project implementation and improving dialogue between
the Bank and the countries concerned.

Directors, the Committee noted the achievements
made by staff in acting upon lessons learned from internal audits and
postevaluations, and again emphasized that the Bank must strive for
constant reassessment and improvement in its operations. In this context,
it noted the importance of self-evaluation by the Bank, as well as evaluation by parties outside the Bank. The Committee emphasized the need
for the Bank to develop relevant, clear, reliable, and measurable performance indicators to be incorporated in its projects at the design stage.
It looked forward to the development and implementation of the project
performance management system in 1998.

Budget Committee: The Budget ReviewCommittee was convened
from10 to 21 November 1997 to review the Bank’s operations during the
year. Members discussed the work plans of various departments and offices,
deliberated on substantive issues underlying Management’s 1998 Budget
proposal, and reached a consensus on its recommendations.

The Committee recommended further strengthening of the Bank's
efforts to catalyze development assistance, while at the same time continuing to improve the quality of the Bank’s integrated services to the
DMCs.

The Committee noted the Bank’s 1997 initiatives in its assistance to
help resolve the currency turmoil affecting some DMCs, and recommended that the Bank build its in-house expertise to provide effective
support to the highly technical and complex areas of establishing and
maintaining sound and efficient financial and capital markets. It welcomed the creation of the Task Force charged with coordinating the
Bank’s response to the crisis and noted that additional budgetary resources had been allocated for processing planned program loans. This
action by the Bank highlighted the need for flexibility in the use of budget
provision to support urgent and priority programs not previously planned
or envisaged and for responding to changing operational needs.

Finally, the Committee recommended that the Board approve the
administrative budget for 1998, and authorized an expenditure of $204.8 million, which, excluding the general contingency provision of 1 percent,
reflected an increase of 3.7 percent over the 1997 revised estimate. This
administrative budget would support $6.1 billion lending, $155 millionThe Board of Directors

 

technical assistance, and $3.7 billion cofinancing programs in 1998, with

Inspection Committee: During 1997, the Inspection Committee received
the first request for inspection, relating to the Korangi Wastewater Management Project in Pakistan, which was referred to the President for
handling as an “initial complaint” under the Bank’s Inspection Procedures.

Detailed Inspection Procedures and general information on the Bank's
inspection policy are included in ADB's Inspection Policy: A Guidebook.
Similar information on the inspection policy is available on the Bank’s
Internet W eb site.

The Committees of the Board of Directors are shown in Appendix 4.

Directors’ visits

The Board of Directors undertook two group visits in 1997: the first to
the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Thailand from
23 Februaryto 8 March 1997; and the second to Indonesia from31 August
to 13 September 1997. During the course of each of
the visits, Board members held wide-ranging policy
discussions with government ministers, senior officials, business representatives and NGOs, and also
saw firsthand A DB-sponsored projects. Directors’ visits
serve two important purposes. First, dialogue with
the countryin question isenhanced. Second, by gaining
a better understanding of the challenges facing DMCs,
Board members can support more effectively and
encourage Bank initiatives designed to address the
development needs in the countries concerned.

In Thailand, Board members met with the Deputy
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, His Excellency
Dr. Amnuay Viravan, as well as other senior officials

the Bank assists its developing member countries (DMCs) in
identifying, formulating, and implementing projects; improving their institutional capabilities; formulating development strategies; promoting
technology transfer; and fostering regional cooperation — elements which.
are essential to economic growth.

Asa major provider of technical assistance in the Asian and Pacific
region, in 1997 the Bank provided $162.5 million in grants to finance
298 technical assistance projects, and provided a further $353.6 million
of technical assistance components in its loan-financed projects. During
the year, 384 individual consultants and 169 teams from consulting firms
were fielded to the Bank’s DMCs through technical assistance grants to
provide advice; help formulate policies, programs, and projects; carry out
studies; and provide training, In addition, a number of regional conferences and workshops were organized with the aid of technical assistance.

The Bank’s technical assistance projects address a wide range of
development issues and challenges. For example, in 1997 technical assistance
helped promote energy-saving construction materials in the People’s Republic
of China, promote public finance reforms at the state government level
in India, promote pension reforms in Kazakstan, improve fisheries management in the Federated States of Micronesia, establish a tender support
bureau in Sri Lanka, and strengthen the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s information disclosure and compliance requirements in
Thailand.

Historical perspective

During the past 31 years of the Bank’s existence, there has been a shift
in the focus of technical assistance. When the Bank was first established,
the founders agreed that technical assistance should be an integral part
of the Bank’s operations (Box1), but the emphasis was on the preparation
of projects suitable for Bank financing. Most notably, technical assistance
financed feasibility studies and other project preparation work. It also
financed project implementation through the provision of supervision
services and institutional strengthening of project executing agencies. In

Box 1: The Early Years

HE BANK’ first operational undertak
ing, approved on 24 May 1967, was a
$155,000 technical assistance grant to survey
Asian agriculture. This technical assistance
was a harbinger of much of the emphasis of
the Bank’s early operations.

The objectives of this first technical
assistance were to survey the needs, problems, and opportunities confronting the agriculture sector in Asia and to inform the world,
including donor countries, of both the urgency and the promise of agricultural development in Asia. What followed were bilateral
discussions to encourage the development of
policies that promoted agricultural growth and
a concentrated investment program to support those policies with the resources and
expertise required to deliver that growth.

By 1978, the Bank had invested
$1,385 million in the agriculture sector in
Asia. This accounted for about 26 percent of
total Bank lending during the period, and
reflected the strong emphasis the Bank placed
on development of the sector. The growth in
agricultural production and productivity in
the region has been spectacular, some of it a
direct result of the seminal directions established in this first Bank technical assistance.

The next operational undertaking of the
Bank wasalso a technical assistance, this one
an advisory technical assistance to the
Government of Indonesia. In 1967, food distribution and food sufficiency had become a
serious issue for Indonesia. Much of the
country’s infrastructure was old and deteriorating and milling storage capacity was limited. The Bank’s technical assistance focused
on technical, administrative, and economic
constraints inhibiting the production of food
crops and their distribution. It resulted in the
formulation of government policies on the
pricing of rice, progressive decentralization of
rice mills, improvements in the availability of
credit to farmers, and pricing policies on the
distribution of rice in urban centers.

These two projects were a powerful
beginning to the Bank’s technical assistance
program.

20

other words, technical assistance was regarded primarily as a modality for
supporting the project financing function of the Bank, which was perceived as its core function.

The emphasis changed in the 1980s and the 1990s. Experiences in
the 1970s and the early 1980s had taught the Bank and its DMCs that
effective development required much more than close attention to projects.
More often than not, the success or failure of a project was decided not
bythe technical and financial quality of the project but by the economic
environment both at the macro and sector levels. Technical and financial
design and close supervision continued to be essential factors for the
success of projects, but these were not enough: a project’s success required.
the right economic environment. The Bank responded to this finding by
intensifying policy dialogue with DMC governments, introducing a policybased lending modality, i.e., the program loan, and, last but not least,
using technical assistance to address key policy issues.

In the late 1980s and the 1990s, the emphasis on policyand broader
institutional capacity was further intensified, and the role of technical
assistance acquired new dimensions. Many DMCs embraced marketoriented, outward-looking economic management strategies and began to
undertake various policy and regulatory reforms to move in that direction.
Also, many of the region’s centrally planned economies began the process
of transiting to a market economy. These changes, combined with various
factors in the industrial countries, resulted in the sudden surge of private
capital flows to the DMCs. In 1986, the level of both private and official
flows stood at about $14 billion. By 1996, private flows had reached
$136 billion.

These private capital flows, however, were not shared equally by all
DMCs. About 90 percent of such flows to Asia were concentrated in just
five countries. There was a need to help other DMCs attract private
capital through technical assistance for reforms in policy and regulatory
frameworks. In the case of countries in transition, technical assistance was
needed to help create and develop a set of institutions for a market
economy. In many DMCs, rapid economic growth entailed infrastructure
development needs which far exceeded the capacity of public sector
financing, Hence, there wasa need fora public-private partnership in the
provision of infrastructure, and technical assistance had an important role
to playin promoting this partnership. The region also faced persisting
poverty, social exclusion of certain groups, especially women, and degradation of the environment. Technical assistance was an important tool
in addressing these problems.

At the same time, asa result of the end of the Cold War, opportunities increased for regional and subregional cooperation. One aspect of
this is cooperation and coordination in trade and investment. The other
is cross-border development of infrastructure and management of natural
resources. The Bank is uniquely positioned to act as broker, promoter, and.
financier for such cooperation, providing its knowledge, experience, and
network to help its DMCs, especially through technical assistance.

Finally, to meet the increasingly complex needs of its DMCs effectively,
the Bank has been redefining its role from that of a project financing
institution to that of a broad-based development institution that providesSpecial Theme: From Project Financier to Broad-Based Development Institution

development assistance. Reflecting this change, the number and amount
of technical assistance grants approved annually have increased dramaticallyin the past ten years, from 135 projects totaling $41.9 million in 1987
to 298 projects totaling $162.5 million in 1997.

Fervent

Nature and structure of the Bank’s technical assistance

Technical assistance is normally defined as activities aimed at strengthening the capacity of the recipient country by developing and improving
human resources, institutional framework, and organization through the
transfer of knowledge, skills, technology, and other nonphysical inputs.
The term can sometimes refer to activities aimed at filling gaps in the
recipient country in terms of knowledge, skills, technology, and organization to carry out specific development activities. Often, these two aspects
are combined.

Technical assistance is distinguished from the Bank’s project financingin that the former essentially provides nonphysical inputs. Usuallythe Average Value of Technical Assistance
outputs are also nonphysical, in the form of improved skills and policies. Grants, 1980-1997
By contrast, project lending activities usually result in physical facilities,
such as an irrigation system, replanted forest, highway, telecommunications facility, or power station. Both technical assistance and project
lendingare considered essential tools for development assistance: physical
facilities support development while improved skills and know-howhelp
countries to manage and eventually initiate new projects and services in
the continuation of the development cycle. Most bilateral donors provide
both modalities, sometimes in combination but often in two distinct
institutions each specialized in one or more fields.

Technical assistance is in essence the provision of expert services. In
this sense, the first source of the Bank’s technical assistance is the Bank’s
staff members. Through studies and research, preparation of country and
sector operational strategies, processing and administration of projects,
and policy dialogue and technical exchange carried out in these processes,
the Bank’s staff provide expert views, advice, and other inputs to their
counterparts in DMCs. However, when the term “technical assistance”
is used in the operational context, it usually refers to Bank financing of
external expert services to be made available to DMC governments and
agencies. These services are often provided bya team of experts from an
engineering or management consulting company. In other cases, individual experts in specific areas of expertise are engaged.

Project identification, formulation, and implementation constituted.
the main focus of the Bank’s technical assistance in its early years of
operations, and these areas remain an important focus today. While DMCs
have built their own capacity to carry out these tasks, as witnessed by an
increased proportion of experts from DMCsin the total consultant resources engaged under the Bank’s technical assistance, international
expertise is still needed because the projects the Bank finances are mostly
at the frontier of development efforts, both from technical and managerial
points of view. Also, because of heightened awareness about the

 

 

21ANNUAL REPORT 1997

 

environmental and social impacts of projects, today’s project preparation
often involves extensive and sophisticated study of these aspects. International and domestic experts complement each other, with state-of-theart technical and methodological know-howand wide experience of the
former and the familiarity with the local situation of the latter.

Depending on the circumstances, the Bank uses grants or loans for
the financing of project preparation. For a feasibility study of relatively
limited size (not more than $1 million), the Bank can provide project
preparatory technical assistance (PPT A), mostly on a grant basis. If the
size of the study is large and requires more than $1 million of Bank
financing, the Bank usually provides technical assistance loan. Project
preparation at the detailed engineering stage can be financed by an
engineering loan. Consulting services for project implementation supervision are treated as a component of the project and costs are covered
bythe loan for the project itself.

The number and amount of PPT A approvals have increased from
45 projects for $10.5 million in 1987 to 78 projects for $43.7 million in
1997. The number of annual PPT A approvalsis primarily determined by

Box 2: Sources of Funds for Technical Assistance

HE BANK’S technical assistance grants are financed

by the Japan Special Fund (JSF), Technical Assistance
Special Fund (TASF), and other sources. In recent years,
financing from JSF has accounted for about 50 percent ofall
technical assistance financing, T ASF for about 35 percent,
and other sources for 15 percent.

The JSF was established in 1988 when the Government
of Japan made an untied (consultants not necessarily from
the contributing country and DMCs) contribution to the
Fund. JSF quickly became a major financing source of the
Bank’s technical assistance. Priority areas set by the
Government of Japan for the use of JSF include restructuring
of economies, broadening the scope of new investment opportunities, and project preparation to assist in recycling
funds to DMCs. The Government of Japan has emphasized
protection of the environment, promotion of the private
sector, and improvement of the status of women, by making
supplementary contributions to JSF to address these concerns.

The T ASF was established in 1967 with voluntary contributions from individual member countries. These contributions were, for the most part, tied to consultants from the
contributing country, limiting the choice ofexpertsandmaking
administration of the funds cumbersome. As a result, the
Bank has been encouraging donors to make their contributions either “partially tied” or “untied.” In 1981, the Bank
adopted the policy of not accepting contributions tied to the
donor country starting in 1983. In 1986, at the time of the
fourth replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (ADF),
it was agreed to transfer an appropriate amount of ADF to

22,

TASF to secure adequate funds for steady technical assistance
operations. A similar arrangement continued under the fifth
ADF replenishment. Asa result, all member countries contributing to ADF ceased to make voluntary contributions to T ASF.
Further, in 1992 the Bank started to transfer a part of the net
income from its ordinary capital resources to T ASF. This was
a marked departure from the past, where OCR net income was
used to supplement T ASF only in a very limited way so that the
maximum amount of OCR net income could be allocated to
Bank reserves. The change in approach from relying on contributions of member countries to TASF, either voluntarily or
through the earmarking of ADF replenishment, to funding the
TASF with Bank resources was completed in 1997 at the time
of the sixth replenishment of ADF. The donors decided that no
funds from the sixth replenishment would be allocated to T ASF
and T ASF requirements would be fully met by transfers of OCR
net income. In 1997, the voluntary contributions to TASF
amounted to only$1.3 million, all from DMCs. For more details
onJSF and T ASF, see the Bank Resourcesand Financial Management chapter, page 161.

In addition to TASF and JSF, the Bank has arrangements
with several bilateral donors for financing £ofinancing of technical assistance with untied grants. These bilateral donors include, among others, the governments of Australia, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and.
Switzerland. Once a project to be financed is agreed upon, the
Bank acts as the administrator of the funds. These bilateral
funds are often used to finance a soft component, such as
capacity building, in a project financed by the Bank’s loan.Special Theme: From Project Financier to Broad-Based Development Institution

 

the level of the Bank’s lending program in the coming years. Not all Bank
loan projectsare prepared with PPT A. Of the 73 loan public sector projects
approved in 1997, 32 projects, or 44 percent, were preceded by PPT As.
For more details, see Table 35 in the Statistical Annex.

Technical assistance for transfer of technology, institutional strengthening, preparation of plans and programs, and conduct of studies is called
advisory technical assistance (ADT A). With the increased emphasis on
the Bank’s policy support and capacity-building functions, ADT A has
increasingly become a crucial tool for Bank operations. The annual approval of ADT As, which are financed by grants, surged from 53 projects
for $23.9 million in 1987 to 165 projects for $91.3 million in 1997. Major
themes for ADT A are described in the following section.

In some cases, technical assistance is provided for the benefit of an
entire region or for more than one DMC. For example, a conference or
study on a subject of common interest in the region, such as urban
infrastructure financing and regional health policy priorities, or a study
or training provided to a group of DMCs sharing the same concerns or
facing similar problems, or project preparation and advisory activities for
subregional cooperation, might warrant a regional technical assistance
(RETA). The number and amount of annual RET A approvals increased.
from 37 projects for $7.5 million in 1987 to 55 projects for $27.5 million
in 1997.

Themes of the Bank’s technical assistance

The Bank’s technical assistance grants cover a multitude of sectors and
subsectors. Over the years, there has been a shift in the focal areas for
assistance. In 1987, assistance in the agriculture and natural resource
sector accounted for 31 percent of all technical assistance grants, followed
byenergy (17 percent), social infrastructure (16 percent), transport and.
communications (15 percent), and industry and nonfuel minerals (10 percent). In 1997, social infrastructure received the bulk ofassistance (22 percent), followed by agriculture and natural resources (21 percent), and
transport and communications (11 percent). While the share ofthe energy -Tuehndeal Assistance Ay Is by Sector,
and industry and nonfuel minerals sectors dropped to 9 percent and 1987 and 1997

0.3 percent, respectively, the financial sector, which did not appear in the
1987 breakdown, nowaccounts for 10 percent. Similarly, various crosssectoral technical assistance which accounted for 11 percent in 1987, has
increased to 26 percent in 1997, addressing cross-sectoral public administration reform/Amprovements (9 percent), environmental protection and
management (5 percent), pension reform and social safety net issues
(2 percent), and strengthening of development-related legal systems and
training of legal officers (2 percent).

These changes reflect the changingneeds of the Bank’s DMCs, which
in turn reflect their different stages of development and changes in the
global environment. For example, agriculture remains one of the most
important sectors needing public sector intervention for development. By
contrast, in a number of DMCs, industry and the exploitation of nonfuel
minerals are increasingly left to the private sector. Reflecting still insufficient levels of social services, demand for technical assistance for this

sector hasbeen increasing, The requirements for assistance in the energy sector and the transport and
communications sector remain high, reflecting the
greater needs for infrastructure development to sustain a high level of economic growth. Many of the
Bank’s technical assistance projects in these sectors
today are for the development of a conducive policy
and regulatory environment for private sector provision of infrastructure. As many DMC governments
embrace the private sector-leddevelopment approach,
technical assistance for strengthening the financial
sector and developing capital markets has increased.
In this context, the need for improved public sector

 

 

 

management has begun to be felt more acutely, includ

inganewpartnership with the private sector. What
followsis a look at how the Bank has been responding to these changing
needs of DMCs through its technical assistance grants and loans.

Encouraging public sector management
and public-private partnerships

The main thrusts of the Bank’s assistance for public sector management
are provided in the policy paper “Governance: Sound Development Management” approved by the Board in October 1995.

The Bank’s concept of good governance focuses on four elements of
effective development management: (i) accountability, (ii) participation,
(iii) predictability, and (iv) transparency. Priority issues of public sector
management and governance to be addressed by the Bank’s technical
assistance include the following:

at the central level, policy coordination, civil service reform,
fiscal management, and the supreme audit function;

+ at the line ministry and agency levels, effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery and strategic management of resources;
at the subnational level, the breakdown of responsibilities between
central, provincial, and local governments, local-level revenue
raising, and local-level service delivery;
public private interface issues, including commercialization,
Privatization, and regulation and regulatory independence;
lawand development issues with particular reference to appropriate legislation in dealing with market-based requirements;
and
strengthening civil society with emphases on disclosure of information, participation, and NGO involvement in the delivery
of development assistance.

Reforming the public sector at the central level: In the past, the Bank
hasassisted DMCs’ public sector management reforms mostly at the line
ministry and agency levels. T oday, the need for Bank assistance at the
central and subnational levelsisincreasing, At the national level, MongoliaSpecial Theme: From Project Financier to Broad-Based Development Institution

 

and Sri Lanka have requested Bank assistance for public sector management reforms. In the case of Mongolia, the Government requested the Bank's
technical assistance to help implement public service reforms based on the
NewZealand model. Tailoring the New Zealand model to the quite different
circumstances of Mongolia wasan important element of the assistance, especially
as the changes in New Zealand had been implemented over more than a

decade and had required considerable resources to implement effectively.

The Bank began this assistance to Mongolia by taking a delegation of
Mongolian parliamentarians and senior officials to New Zealand to witness
firsthand how the model worked, and then to the State of Victoria in Australia
tosee howthe New Zealand model was adapted to a different set of circumstances. This initial work was followed by the provision of substantial
technical assistance to provide expert advice to help design and implement a broad series of public sector management reforms.

In the case of Sri Lanka, the Bank’s technical assistance catalyzed
a reform program aimed at creating a results-oriented public service. The
report of the Bank's technical assistance consultants helped the Govemment
to establish institutional arrangements to guide and drive the reform
program.

At the subnational level, the Bank provided technical assistance to
the State Government of Gujarat in India for comprehensive public sector
restructuring, including fiscal consolidation, public enterprise reforms,
and public utility reforms. There are also cases of Bank technical assistance on specific functions at the central level, such as economic management, fiscal management, procurement, and audit (Box3).

Reforming municipal management: In the area of municipal management, the most important role of the Bank will be to help DMCs develop
a vision for the future, anticipate the scale and structure of their cities,
and prepare well-framed investment programs and action plans to mobilize the resources required ( Box 4). DMCsneed not only develop their
local governments, but also create new metropolitan institutions with
well-defined functions and funding well suited to these functions. In
addition, theyneed to encourage municipalities to tap the experience and
funding of the private sector. In this endeavor, the Bank can liaise closely
with other international development agencies and the private sector.

Encouraging privatization: An important agenda for public sector management reforms is restructuring of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). In
many DMCs, SOEsare in trouble, causing a drain on public funds, and
becoming a heavy burden in fiscal management. The restructuring of the
SOEs and their privatization form an important agenda for fiscal reform in
many DMCs (Box 5). The Bankassists these DMCs through technical assistance and loans. For example, a succession of technical assistance to Samoa
in the period 1989-1992 resulted in the sale of two loss-making enterprises
to the private sector as going concerns, liquidation of five enterprises, and
contracting out the government transport pool to the private sector.

Developing the policy and regulatory framework for the private sector
provision of infrastructure: The Bank’s assistance in public-private

OUND ACCOUNTING and auditing

practices are a precondition for transparent, efficient, and effective public financial
management and good governance. Effective
public auditing is essential to ensure uniform
accounting standards, to prevent and detect
deviations from good accounting practices in
public resource management, and to induce
improvements in both administrative reporting and internal control systems. In 1995, in
recognition of this strong link between effective audit and sound development management, the Bank decided to fund a regional
technical assistance to train regional auditors in “performance” audit. The program
had as beneficiaries the Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) belonging to the Asian
Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions
(ASOSAI).

The training program consisted of a twoweek workshop on fundamental principles,
concepts, and methods of performance auditing. It was to serve the twofold purpose of
(i) providing the participants — 25 were from
the Bank’s DMCs — with the basic knowledge and practical skills needed to carry out
performance audits, and (ii) developing the
trainees’ ability to pass on the acquired skills
to other staff in their institutions through a
“train the trainers” component. T o maximize
impact, the program was targeted at senior
auditors with audit supervisory and/or public
sector managerial experience.

The success of this technical assistance
led to another Bank technical assistance to
ASOSATI, this time for a regional long-term
training program designed to (i) assist
ASOSAI to assume increasing responsibility
for designing and organizing the regional training programs and information exchange facilities, and (ii) upgrade both the training
and technical audit skills of individual S Als.
The program, approved in 1996, is ongoing
with completion of the program expected in
1998.

Box 4: Municipal Management Reform
in Lahore, Pakistan

HEN THE Bank wanted to examine what effect

citizens’ involvement in municipal affairs might
have on citymanagement and urban governance, it looked
to Lahore, Pakistan. Lahore’s Chief Minister had indicated that he wanted some dramatic improvements in
service delivery in the capital city of Punjab. A smallscale technical assistance was provided to test the approach
of developing and implementing an action plan for municipal management reform through the participatory
process as a means of starting a process that would lead
to more accountable and effective city government.

A cross-section of the citizens of Lahore including
representatives of business, NGOs, market committees,
and the media were contacted and meetings involving
both citizens and service providers were organized. T wo
workshops were held in which major issues relevant to
effective city management were raised and discussed.
The workshops led to a proposed action plan which
targeted

+ institutional restructuring with an emphasis on eliminating overlapping functional responsibilities between
organizations, and devolution of service delivery responsibilities within the city to the zonal level;

+ introduction of professional managers and staffing
policies aimed at creating an effective work force;

+ privatization where the need for an appropriate regulatory framework and transparency in the process
was stressed;

+ budgeting and finance, under which the use of budget as a planning and management tool and ways of
increasing municipal revenues were recommended;
and

+ need for community involvement, particularly in setting investment priorities, establishing and monitoring performance indicators in service delivery, and
solid waste collection.

Those involved in the process of formulating the
action plan formed a concerned citizens’ group to promote community involvement in managing Lahore. City
managers and other professionals attending the seminar

partnership focuses on the private provision of infrastructure.
Facing the enormous needs for developing and upgrading infrastructure, many of the Bank’s DMCs are now tapping private
funds and. expertise, especially from industrial countries, for the
provision of infrastructure through build-own-operate (BOO)
or build-operate-transfer (BOT ) schemes. The Bank has been
encouraging such moves, as this helps governments meet infrastructure needs that cannot be met otherwise, allows the release
of public funds for much-needed social services, and increases
efficiency and quality of services through competition. Private
sector provision of infrastructure requires appropriate arrangements for risk-sharing and the policy and regulatory framework
to meet these requirements, and the wherewithal to develop
appropriate institutional mechanisms to implement the framework. In some cases, technical assistance has been given to help
develop national policy or sectoral frameworks for BOO BOT
schemes. In another case, the Bank has assisted a government
in preparingand implementinga model BOO BOT project which
can be replicated. Also, a RET A hasbeen provided to disseminate the collective experience and expertise on this issue and
for capacity building of DMCs in the economic analysis of
BOO BOT projects.

Promoting the development of the financial sector and capital
markets: In many of the Bank’s DMCs, the domestic savings
rate is relatively high. What is lacking is a mechanism to channel these savings to productive investments. A well-functioning,
financial sector and a capital market constitute such a mechanism. The Bank has been pursuing this in many DMCs through
its program loan (policy-based lending) and technical assistance
modalities (Box6 ). A typical reform agenda promoted by the
Bank in the financial sector and capital markets includes
(i) limiting the scope of direct credit; (ii) deregulating and/or
rationalizing interest rates; (iii) reducing public sector preemption of financial sector resources; (iv) increasing the autonomy
of state-owned financial institutions; (v) promoting private
financial intermediation; (vi) enhancing competition within the
financial sector by removing barriers to entry and market segmentation; (vii) improving the ability of the central bank to
conduct monetary policy through open market operations;
(viii) promoting development of a debt securities market by
establishing interest rate benchmarks and enhancing liquidity,
(ix) easing regulatory and infrastructure bottlenecks to capital
market development, such as administrative controls over share
issue prices, inadequate disclosure and investor protection rules,
and outdated trading and clearance and settlement systems;
and (x) strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial system, including capital adequacy ratios,
portfolio classification and loan-loss provisioning standards, and.
exposure guidelines. Technical assistance is often provided toSpecial Theme: From Project Financier to Broad-Based Development Institution

 

accompany a program loan to help implement these reformsand strengthen
required institutional capacity.

Assisting in the social sectors

The purpose of development is to improve the quality of life of people.

In the Asian and Pacific region, impressive economic growth in the past

few decades has contributed to dramatic improvements in the quality of
life. However, there are countries, regions within the countries, and
particular segments of population that have been left behind. There isa

need to encourage governments to payan increased level of attention to

the quality-of-life aspect and strengthen their social services, especially
those for disadvantaged regions and groups. At the same time, many DMC

governments are operating under tight resource situations, facing trade
offs among competing development needs. There is a need to explore
innovative approaches for the delivery of quality social services in costeffective ways. The Bank’s technical assistance can, and does, play an
important role in this area.

In the health sector, for example, technical assistance is helping
DMCs to decentralize health services, encouraging an increased level of
community participation and public-private partnership, such as contracting out of health services. In the education sector, technical assistance
is helping countries in transition to restructure their educational systems
within the parameters of a market economy. This involves more marketoriented course development for higher education and an increased level
of community participation for primary and secondary education, both in

Box 5: Privatization in the Kyrgyz Republic

N IMPORTANT question about privatization is when to

do it. Where there is not a reasonably developed market,
financial institutions, capital base, or an effective private sector, any attempt at privatization risks failure or the need for
further public support. In the Kyrgyz Republic, for example,
early attempts at privatization sometimes resulted in a structure
and dispersion of ownership which was detrimental to good
corporate governance. The relative absence of proper legal
conventions and arrangements resulted in an absence of protection for owners and incentives for management to operate
the businesses as efficiently as possible. Ownership was either
too dispersed among too many small outside shareholders, or
concentrated in the hands of insiders who lacked incentive for
restructuring and who ran the businesses for themselves rather
than for the shareholders. Financial discipline was not exercised
in a responsible way. Not only was it difficult for minority
owners to exercise their rights; but also, by and large, they did
not know what their rights were.

The Bank’s technical assistance set about developing a
capacity on the part of government officials to develop the

diagnostic skills to review existing corporate governance practices in the Kyrgyz Republic, compare these with practices
elsewhere in the world, and understand how these practices
needed to be monitored to make them effective. The efforts of
the working group set up under the technical assistance were
closely paralleled in the Cabinet which openly debated the
merits of the alternatives examined in the technical assistance.
The principal outputs were a Company Charter which has been
made mandatory for all medium- and large-scale enterprises,
and an accompanying handbook on best practice in corporate
governance. The Charter ensures that medium- and large-scale
enterprises in the Kyrgyz Republic implement sound and effective systems of corporate governance. In addition, the technical assistance helped in the finalization of anew Bankruptcy
Law which was enacted shortly after the Charter was promulgated. The Charter and the associated measures to implement
and enforce its provisions form the core of the Corporate
Governance and Enterprise Reform Program. The Bank is maintaining the impetus for reform through an associated loan.

Box 6: Financial Sector Development in Mongolia

WAS evident that the banking sector would playa key strategic role in
Mongolia’s transition to a market economy, especially after the 1990
promulgation of the Banking Law which separated the Central Bank from
commercial banks. It was equally evident that the Mongolian commercial
banking system needed to be strengthened. A combination of measures at
the macroeconomic, sector policy, and individual institutional levels was
needed. Complementary measures were also needed to address structural
constraints to efficient commercial banking operations such as stabilization
policies anda liberalized foreign exchange regime. Proper accounting standards
and adequate banking supervision systems also were needed at the Central
Bank level. Mongolia neither had the resources nor the expertise to address

these issues.

The Bank designed a series of technical assistance and one loan to assist
the Mongolian Government to address the financial sector. This assistance

resulted in

+ anewSecurities Lawand regulations,

+ the establishment of the Securities Exchange Commission to oversee the
securities market and its institutions;

+ automation of the stock exchange trading operations,

+ a review of loan portfolios;

curriculum development and financing. The Bank’s technical assistance

has also addressed the issue of education for disadvantaged segments of
the population, in particular women and the poor. A RET A examined the

impact of education on the status of women, and led to the formulation

of a women’s education project in the Lao PDR. In the water supply
sector, Bank technical assistance has helped DMCs to improve the man
agement of water supply utilities and restructure water tariffs. In some
instances, the Bank’s technical assistance has helped in the commercial
ization of water supply services and introduction of BOO BOT schemes
for water supply.

Improving the status of women

Interventions that benefit women are widely recognized as crucial to
development, in that poor health, low levels of education and training,
and limited access to resources constrain the quality of life, economic
efficiency and growth, and the overall sustainability of development.
Technical assistance grants have been used to

strengthen the institutional capacity of government focal points
on women;

cosponsor activities with other development agencies;
enhance the institutional capacity of nongovernment women’s
organizations; and

conduct research and dialogue on regional gender issues.

The Bank has been active at the regional level to encourage a common approach to addressing the concerns of women throughout the region.
For example, regional concerns such as the Asia-Pacific’s preparatory
activities for the 1995 Beijing W orld Conference, including the Ministerial and Senior Government Officials Meetings, were cosponsored by the
Bank with the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific. Similarly, in 1997 the Bank sponsored the participation
of 15 women leaders from Asian and Pacific nongovernment organizations
(NGOs) in the Global Summit on Women’s Eco
 

nomic Empowerment to ensure that the region was
represented at this important conference.

Addressing the question of poverty through the
marketplace, a RET A has promoted women’s microfinance institutions through capacity building in
women’s organizations in six of the Bank’s DMCs
that are primarily involved in delivering microfinance
to poor women. The idea of continuous improvement is being introduced through encouraging these
organizations to establish a network to share experiencesand best practices and to support exchanges
of successful women entrepreneurs to explain how
they have succeeded and to encourage others to
develop their own business ideas.

 

 

 

 

Country-specific technical assistance grants
have enabled the Bank to place gender concerns
on the mainstream development agenda of interested DMCs. For
example, in Cambodia, technical assistance has led to the adoption
of a National Policy on Women and the e stablishment of a Ministry of
Women’s Affairs.

Protecting the environment

The Bank hasbeen increasing its technical assistance in the environmental field for a number of years (Box7). During 1991-1997, the Bank
provided a total of $132 million for 208 technical assistance projects to
address environmental issues. Some of this assistance has been used to
try to get environmental cells established in ministries and departments
whoee activities can have major impacts on the environment. For example,

Indonesia’s Public W orks Department, essentially to provide it with a
capacity to produce environmental impact assessments of planned public
works projects. Environmental subdirectorates have been established in
each of the Directorates General comprising the Ministry of Public W orks.
In other cases, technical assistance was aimed at capacity building of
institutions for conducting environmental impact assessments and for
monitoring. For example, in the People’s Republic of China, the Bank
provided a series of technical assistance to train officials at the national
and provincial levels on environmental impact assessment, develop an
environmental management information system, and strengthen environmental legislation and enforcement.

There are also a number of RET A projects addressing environmental
issues. For example, the teaching of environmental lawis being strengthened through a RET A jointly financed by the Bank, the International
Union for Conservation of Nature, the National University of Singapore,
the United Nations Environment Programme, and the United Nations
University.

Promoting regional and subregional cooperation
In the past decade, a number of forces have emerged in favor of closer
regional and subregional cooperation, such as the end of the cold war,

liberalization of economic policy in many DMCs, and increased levels of
regional trade and investments. Regional and subregional cooperation is

Box 7: Environmental Management of Chao Lake, People’s Republic of China

HAO LAKE in the People’s Republic of China is the

main water source for the municipal, industrial, agricultural, and recreational uses of almost eight million residents
living within its basin. But Chao Lake is polluted. The water
quality in the lake has been deteriorating at an alarming rate,
with the level of key nutrients having tripled during the past
15 years. Poor water quality has led to interruptions of supply
in the summer months, leaving the 1.5 million urban residents
who depend on the lake for their water with only partial water
service for several weeks at a time. The seriousness of the
environmental degradation of the lake was recognized by local
authorities and the National Environmental Protection Agency
alike. Restoration of water quality was given high priority by
the national Government. The Bank was asked to assist with
the formulation of an environmental program to reduce the
major point source discharges from municipal and industrial
sources and to tackle all sources of pollution, including nonpoint
agricultural runoff in the longer term.

The main objective of the investment programs is to eliminate the major point sources of pollution into Chao Lake. The
resulting $336 million investment program, supported by a
$140 million finance package from the Bank, has already produced significant changes.

+ Followinga concerted policy dialogue by the Bank, wastewater tariffs were introduced in Hefei and Chaohu cities.
The tariff, which is based on 85 percent of the monthly
water bills, is paid by all water users, including industries
which have their own water sources. From Hefei alone,
the revenue is generating an annual $4 million, which is
being used to finance $16 million of the construction
cost during the four-year implementation period of the

Project.

+ Both the Hefei and Chaohu wastewater treatment utilities have been corporatized. Their debt has been restructured so that they can operate without further subsidies.
The wastewater tariffs and a connection fee which has also
been introduced will ensure that they will be able to generate a minimum return on assets of7 percent.

nowconsidered an important means for accelerating economic growth
and social development. The Bank is well positioned to promote regional
and subregional cooperation and has four complementary functions for
this purpose. First, through its research and regional technical assistance,
the Bank provides information to increase its DMCs’ understanding of the
importance of cooperation. It applies its experience to identify possible
bottlenecks to cooperation and suggests how these could be overcome.
Second, because of its nonpartisan character, the Bank is in a position
to act asan “honest broker.” While cooperation depends on the individual
and collective political will of the DMCs concerned, the Bank plays an

important supportive role by encouraging dialogue, suggesting
approaches, and identifying possible projects. Third, the Bank
can finance investments in the subregion in such areas as
transportation, communications, energy, forestry and other
environmental management, poverty reduction, and human
development. Fourth, the Bank can catalyze the mobilization
of funds from other sources, such as bilateral and multilateral
agencies and the private sector.

While the best known example of the Bank’s involvement in subregional cooperation is that of the Greater Mekong
Subregion (Box 8), there are a number of other subregional
cooperation initiatives that the Bank has assisted. Some of
these initiatives are based on the growth triangle concept,
involving three or more countries sharing some geographical

which was predominantly market- and private sector-driven, the growth
triangle concept now includes those involving Singapore, the Malaysian
state of Johore, and the Indonesian province of Riau; the IndonesiaMaalaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT); andthe Brunei DarussalamIndonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA).
Bank technical assistance helped finance the study of the area’s potential
and the development of a comprehensive set of policies and projects to
achieve the area’s overall growth objectives. The Bank is also assisting
subregional cooperation initiatives in South Asia, in Central Asian republics,
and between the Central Asian republicsand the People’s Republic of China.

Yet another example of Bank technical assistance for regional cooperation is that for the development of newinitiatives on infrastructure
financing and capital market development in Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC). The objective was to assist emerging market economies in the APEC region to mobilize more effectively their high savings
through greater and more efficient capital market intermediation. The
technical assistance resulted in a Voluntary Principles and Collaborative
Initiatives paper which was adopted by the APEC Finance Ministers at
their meeting in Cebu, Philippines in April 1997. This initiative has
promoted greater understanding of the benefits of capital market integration and best practice in capital market development at a time when these
markets have become subject to increased uncertainty and instability

regionally.

Box 8: Technical Assistance for the Greater Mekong Subregion

UBREGIONAL ECONOMIC cooperation in the

Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), with a combined population of nearly 240 million, was initiated by the Bank in 1992
through a regional technical assistance (RET A). There is good
rationale for subregional cooperation among countries with
close geographical, cultural, and historical links, and which
share important natural resources. The onset of peace among
the countries as well as the opening up and liberalization of
centrally planned economies in the subregion offered the Bank
a good opportunity to initiate a program of cooperation among
the GMS countries. For a subregion with a long history of
conflict, launching such a program wasa very challenging task.
Accordingly, when the GMS Program of Economic Cooperation was initiated in 1992, the Bank took a pragmatic, buildingblock approach, emphasizing action- and results-oriented
initiatives. From the beginning, the Bank clearly defined its
role in the Program as that ofa facilitator, catalyst, and honest
broker — promoting and encouraging dialogue, providing a
forum for such dialogue, and assisting in project identification
and development.

Following a building-block approach, the Bank’s strategy
for promoting economic cooperation in the GMS has been
implemented in three phases. Phase I, which was funded bya
RETA of $270,000, was the preparatory phase designed to
reach consensus on the need for subregional cooperation and
identify potential areas for such cooperation. During Phase I,
the GMS countries agreed on an institutional framework for
cooperation and identified seven sectors/areas under this
framework: transport, energy, telecommunications, environment, human resource development, trade and investment,
and tourism. A second RET A of $5.26 million was approved
for Phase II, which carried the Program through its planning
phase, involving the conduct of subregional sector studies
and project identification for each of these sectors/areas. A
third RETA of $3 million was granted in 1996 to carry the
Program through its implementation phase, strengthen institutional arrangements, build intersectoral linkages to address
broader development concerns, and develop consistency between subregional cooperation and domestic policies and programs.

After six years, the time, effort, and resources devoted to
the Program appear to have paid off. A framework of cooperation in the seven priority sectors has been established. The
process of subregional cooperation has been institutionalized,
with the GMS countries adopting arrangements for coordinating and sustaining subregional cooperation activities at both
the national and subregional levels. Seven ministerial-level

32

conferences have been held so far, and various sector working
groups and forums have met to discuss subregional activities.
About 100 subregional projects have been identified and prioritized, and a number of these projects are already being implemented or entering the implementation stage. Increasing
attention is also being given to the “soft” aspects of cooperation
such as the liberalization and harmonization of rules and procedures governing the cross-border movement of people and
goods. Social and environmental concerns are carefully considered in the planning, design, and implementation of all subregional projects.

The Bank’s technical assistance has played a key role in
supporting these activities. Since the Program started in 1992,
the Bank has approved 22 technical assistance projects for the
GMS with a total cost of $33.2 million. Less than 10 percent of
the amount is from the Bank’s T echnical Assistance Special
Fund; one-half have come from the Bank-administered Japan
Special Fund; one-fourth was contributed by cofinancing sources,
namely: Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Japan, Norway,
Sweden, Switzerland, the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, and the UN Environment
Programme; and the remainder was contributed by the recipient governments. Some of the technical assistance projects
were for the preparation of investment projects, which so far
have resulted in about $370 million of Bank lending. By leveraging these funds, the Bank was able to mobilize an additional
amount of about $700 million from other donors and the recipient countries.

Used effectively, technical assistance is a potent instrument for supporting a sectoral or regional strategy and paves
the way for loan assistance to address specific development
needs. The technical assistance to the GMS, however, went
beyond its pragmatic results. A notable achievement of the
Program has been the friendship, mutual trust, and respect that
now pervade the countries once beleaguered by conflict and
strife. Through its technical assistance to the GMS, the
Bank also contributed to fostering a conducive environment
for private sector investments in the subregion. Partly asa
result of the achievements under the GMS Program, there is
now a growing demand for Bank assistance for promoting
subregional cooperation in other parts of Asia, e.g., Central
Asian republics and South Asia. In the context of shrinking
availability of overseas development assistance and private
capital, technical assistance for regional cooperation efforts,
such as those exemplified in the GMS, provides the Bank with
an effective mechanism to contribute to the economic growth
of the DMCsin the region.Special Theme: From Project Financier to Broad-Based Development Institution

 

Key features of the Bank’s technical assistance

Technical assistance comes in many forms. It isassistance in carrying out
policy studies, providing advice, supporting project preparation and implementation, and enhancing capabilities of a country. Many bilateral and
multilateral donors provide technical assistance for these same purposes.
What then differentiates the Bank’s technical assistance from that provided by other donors?

Close integration with lending and policy dialogue

One important aspect of the Bank’s technical assistance is its integration

into the broad-based development assistance functions of the Bank. The

Bank’s technical assistance is often a result of intensive policy dialogue
with the recipient government. Also, technical assistance provides valu
able expert advice and inputs for the further advancement of policy
dialogue. Further, the policy dialogue is backed by the Bank’s lending,
which would help the government to implement reform measures that
have emerged from the policy dialogue and technical assistance. In the

area of project preparation, the Bank has the advantage of being at the
same time the provider of technical assistance and the future financier
of the project to be prepared. The Bank knows key issues to be addressed

during the feasibility study from the financier’s viewpoint. The experience

gained and lessons learned from the implementation of previous projects
help the Bank design and implement PPT A.

Large pool of experts

When compared with bilaterally funded technical assistance, the Bank’s
technical assistance differs largely on the pool of consultancy assistance
accessed to do the work. While bilateral donors generally restrict their
pool of consultants to their nationals, the Bank’s pool is limited only by
its membership. More than 2,500 firms from 43 member countries, and
more than 6,300 individual consultants from 48 member countries are
registered in the Bank’s database on consultants, covering a wide range
of expertise. In addition, in recent years, the Bank’s technical assistance
is drawing on resources and expertise from NGOs through various cooperation programs ( Box9).

Being free of a political agenda

An important aspect of all Bank technical assistance is that they are
perceived as being free of any political agenda. Hence, the Bank is called
in to conduct studies and present alternatives, enabling governments to
choose among them, depending on their own political preferences. Any
new policy, if it is to be implemented effectively, must be politically
marketable. Its political neutrality enables the Bank to influence policy
in a number of sensitive areas, particularly in the economic and social
fields, policy areas to which other donors might find it more difficult to

Box 9: Technical Assistance and Nongovernment
Organizations

OOPERATION WITH nongovernment organizations (NGOs) is

an important part of the Bank’s overall operations, including its technical assistance activities. An increasing number of technical assistance projects
are being implemented in cooperation or in partnership with NGOs. At the
same time, a range of technical assistance projects addressing NGO issues are
being undertaken to strengthen the role that NGOs play in national development efforts. Greater involvement of NGOs in technical assistance activities is consistent with the Bank’s initiatives in developing stronger ties with
NGOsin all aspects of its operations.

The overall objective of cooperation with NGOs in advisory and projectrelated technical assistance activities is to strengthen the effectiveness,
sustainability, and quality of the technical assistance the Bank offers. NGOs
often are aware of specific local development needs and circumstances and
can identify innovative approaches toward meeting the objectives that technical assistance addresses. NGOs frequently are consulted in the development of technical assistance and, in a number of cases, are involved directly
in the preparation and implementation of technical assistance projects. In an
increasing number of projects, NGOs are being engaged as consultants to
undertake necessary studies or to implement specific project components. In
several cases, NGOs have been engaged as implementing agencies for entire
projects. In Lao PDR, for example, technical assistance for the preparation of
an education project for women engaged a local NGO asa resident coordinator, to serve as the functional link between the consultant team, the Bank,
and the Ministry of Education. In Cambodia and Pakistan, technical assistance projects in the health sector are being designed with specific components to be implemented by NGOs. In Bhutan and the Philippines, NGOs
will participate in technical assistance projects aimed at strengthening local
capacities for environmental impact assessment and preparation of environmental guidelines and for the evaluation of environmental standards for

gain access. It also allows the Bank to play the role of “honest broker”
and promoter for regional and subregional cooperation initiatives.

Promoting South-South cooperation and the use of DMC consultants

A trend in development assistance has been for donor agencies to provide
expert advice to developing nations. Bilateral aid by its very nature tends
to be locked into such a model. The Bank’s technical assistance, by
contrast, emphasizes a “South-South cooperation” — in other words,
advice based on equivalent and recent experience. The model hasbeen
followed by the Bank in a number of areas, most notably in training. For
example, certain kinds of training provided from a center in Bangkok,
Kuala Lumpur, or Singapore are more effective than equivalent courses
from a nation outside the region because trainers and trainees share
similar experiences and problems. The model is being expanded by theSpecial Theme: From Project Financier to Broad-Based Development Institution

 

selected industries. In a project preparatory technical assistance in Indonesia
for an integrated area development project, NGOs have been engaged to
undertake environmental and social assessment studies. In Nepal, NGOs
have been engaged asimplementing agencies for technical assistance projects,
focused on environmental protection and microcredit for women.

In addition to technical assistance addressing project development, the
Bank also provides technical assistance that addresses capacity building for
NGOs and the policy environments in which NGOs

 

 

work. Where possible and appropriate, the Bank uses
technical assistance to promote an enabling environment
for partnerships that involve the Bank, NGOs, and govermments. In a regional technical assistance project to
strengthen the capacity of women’s NGOs, training and
capacity building are being provided for some 180 women’s
NGOsin seven of the Bank’s DMCs. In Bangladesh, the
Bank recently approved the third of a series of technical
assistance projects to strengthen government-NGO
cooperation, and the capacity of NGOs to participate in
development projects supported by the Bank and other
donor agencies. Nearing completion is a regional technical assistance project studying NGOs in nine DMCs,
to establish an accurate profile of national NGO communities and identify specific approaches how the Bank,

 

 

 

 

 

 

NGOs, and governments can together work more effectively and productively. The role of NGOs is a major
focus in technical assistance, supporting implementation of the Agenda for
Action on Social Development in Asia and the Pacific that emerged from the
World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen. Recognizing
their expertise and technical capacity, NGOs are invited often to participate
in conferences and seminars supported by technical assistance.

Bank into other areas. For example, a proposed technical assistance in
municipal government hasan objective of establishinga network of municipal
governments in Asia to benchmark their services and share information
about continuousimprovement.

Another area in which the Bank is able to use its regional presence
effectively to build up alliances through technical assistance is in the more
specific one-to-one relationships which can be established between agencies operating in the same field.

The Bank’s technical assistance has had a profound impact on the
establishment of viable, local consultancy industries in most of the large
DMCs, leading to a reduction of a DMC’s dependence on external expert
assistance. During 1995-1997, consultants from DMCs accounted for
53 percent of persondays of consulting services contracted under the
Bank’s technical assistance grants, 40 percent as domestic consultants,
and 13 percent as international consultants.

Participatory development involving
beneficiaries and NGOs helps lessen
possible adverse impacts of projects on
people and the environment.

Ensuring more effective assistance

Recent review of technical assistance operations. The Bank's technical
assistance interventions have had varied results. A recent review of Bank
technical assistance found that, while 68 percent of the advisory technical
assistance examined produced sustainable technical improvements, only
37 percent produced sustainable capacity-building results. Shortcomings
noted by the review included (i) inadequate prior sector and institutional
analysis; (ii) ad hoc, one-shot approach with relatively small technical
assistance lacking long-term perspective and commitment; (iii) lack of
measurable and monitorable indicators of success; (iv) overemphasis on
production of reports and hardware supply and inadequate attention to
strengthening of management ability; (v) limited recipient ownership and
participation, reflected among others in the lack of active participation
of higher management of the institutions concerned; (vi) inadequate
attention during consultant selection to the special skills needed for
deliveringadult trainingand capacity-building services; and (vii) insufficient
follow-up of technical assistance recommendations and follow-on assistance from the Bank.

These findings led to a major review of the Bank’s technical assistance policies, which was discussed by the Board of Directorsin July1997.
This review has resulted in a number of changes to the way in which
assistance is to be delivered. A number of principles to guide the identification of technical assistance has also been adopted. The most important of these is the emphasis on a longer-term perspective and continuing
partnership with the agencies working in a sector, noting that capacity

building is essentially a long-term process. The move

 

 

in this direction will require heightened attention to
technical assistance in the formulation of the Bank’s

country operational strategies and country programs.
A higher level of selectivity and focus will be needed

Box 10: Participatory Approach
in Livestock Development in Nepal

HERE ARE many ways to elicit effective community participation. One promising approach is the
so-called “systems learning approach” which was first
introduced to the Bank and DMCs in a workshop in
1986 on Livestock Development. This, in turn, led to twoday workshops on the approach to enable Bank staff to use

it when developing terms of reference for project design.
The approach was pilot-tested in a technical assistance to developa master
plan for the livestock sector in Nepal. The process was effective at the government level, receiving strong support from the Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock and resulting in a master plan not only adopted formally but also
enthusiastically implemented. The process was extended to the Third Livestock
Development Proje ct in Nepal which became the first “farmer-driven” project
whereby conventional roles were reversed. Farmers specified what they wanted;Special Theme: From Project Financier to Broad-Based Development Institution

 

in choosing technical assistance projects. Ad hoc, one-shot technical
assistance in a sector which is not central to the Bank’s country
strategy will no longer occur except in the most pressing circumstances. This will allowthe Bank to provide adequate levels of technical assistance resources over an extended period for a limited number
of strategically selected sectors, and at the same time facilitate followup of recommendations and identification of necessary follow-on assistance. The selectivity and focus of technical assistance should be
based on ownership and commitment on the part of the recipient of
the assistance, which will be demonstrated through the formation of
a dedicated team from within the executing agency to produce the
designated outputs with the assistance of the consultancy team, rather
than consultants carrying out tasks on their behalf.

The design and implementation of technical assistance will be
improved by focusing more clearly on outputs and impacts rather than
inputs (Box10). To facilitate this move, the new policy has made it
mandatory to use the logical framework in design, implementation,
and evaluation of technical assistance. The use of a logical framework
will also encourage the Bank and the recipient to examine better the
project proposal in the strategic perspective for the sector concemmed.

One cause for the unsatisfactory result of the Bank’s advisory
technical assistance in capacity building is that, in the past, such
technical assistance focused on specific technical skills. Often, training was done by the technically well-qualified consultants responsible
for the technical aspects of the project but who did not have enough
experience in training. Such training rarely achieved the desired results. The Bank’s Governance and Capacity Building Resource Group,
established in February 1997, provides internal expert support to Bank
staffin project design to ensure that the technical challenges aspired
to bya project are balanced with the delivery systems which are
required to support the technical innovation.

public servants facilitated their achieving these objectives. The process has
formally linked District Livestock Officers with farmers’ associations in action teams which are able to co-opt other specialists whenever required. One
of the roles of the District Livestock Officer is to facilitate participatory
planning so that members of a farmers’ association are able to decide what
their needs are, what resources and support theyneed to achieve their goals,
and the set of actions they need to implement to achieve these ends. The
facilitation team assists the farmers by organizing and coordinating technical
inputs, training, and credit as maybe required. A local monitoring system has
also been introduced which enables impact to be monitored at the farmer
level so that a feedback loop exists from the farmers’ associations to the
central level. This qualitative system of checks and balances augments the
conventional monitoring system conducted by the executing agency.

Box 11: Technical Assistance for Countries Affected
by the Current Financial Crisis

HE RECENT Bankassistance packages to Thailand and the Republic of

Korea, which were provided as part of the IMF-led assistance packages,
illustrate the role of technical assistance in the Bank’s support. In both cases,
the Bank’s assistance took the form of a program loan (policy-based lending)
aimed both at providing quick liquidity to help the countries overcome the
immediate liquidity crunch and help them carry out reforms to address the
structural weaknesses in the financial sector underlying the crisis. Technical
assistance constituted essential components for the latter objective.

In the case of Thailand, three technical assistance grants totaling $2.39 million were provided, accompanying a loan of $300 million for the Financial
Markets Reform Program. The Reform Program supported by the loan was
aimed to (i) strengthen market regulation and supervision; (ii) improve risk
management; (iii) diversify the means of intermediating funds within the
economy, and develop the securities markets to facilitate investor and issuer
access to investment vehicles and instruments that more appropriately match
their requirements, and (iv) develop long-term institutional sources of funds
by promoting the development of pension and provident funds. The three
technical assistance grants were to (i) assist reforms in pension and provident
funds through studies on the integration of social security and pension and
provident funds into a single system, and measures to support greater investment of pension and provident funds in the capital markets; (ii) study disclosure and compliance requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission;
and (iii) assist in operationalizing the Government's decree on securitization
through drafting legislation on trusts, preparing a strategic and operational
plan for the Secondary Mortgage Corporation, and undertaking a study on
measures for credit enhancement of securitized assets and a study on pricing
and tax structure.

In the case of the Republic of Korea, a technical assistance loan of
$15 million accompanied a loan of $4 billion for the Financial Sector Program. The Program was designed to support financial sector reform through
increased reliance on market forces and independent regulatory oversight. It
addresses four major areas: (i) commercial banks; (ii) nonbank financial
institutions; (iii) financial markets; and (iv) corporate accounting and disclosure standards. The accompanying technical assistance will (i) strengthen the
Financial Supervisory A gency in establishing a basic institutional framework,
policies regarding the entry and exit of financial institutions, operational
regulation procedures, and supervisory measures and practices; (ii) strengthen
the Korea Asset Management Corporation through estimating the amount
required for the fund which is being established for troubled financial institutions, review its financial plan and operational strategy, and examine the
lessons from similar experiences in other countries; (iii) upgrade the credit
information and rating systems; and (iv) reviewinstitutional and other aspects
of the introduction of mortgage-backed securities.

project. In the past, weaknesses were found in the attention to the organization and human resources aspects of the projects as well as the environmental and social impacts. In recent years, however, the Bank has
strengthened the treatment of environmental and social impacts substantially by issuing new policies and guidelines and providing staff training.
The Bank has also promoted the adoption of a participatory approach in
project design and implementation to directly involve project beneficiaries and other stakeholders. At one level, the thrust in participation has
been to encourage a greater partnership between the Bank and the project
executing agency with higher levels of participation of the executing
agency staff in design work. At another level, the Bank has promoted
participation at the community level to ensure relevance and to generate
an appropriate degree of community ownership of a project.

Continuing challenges

The Bank has been providing development assistance to DMCs for over
31 years. Technical assistance has played keystrategic role in the Bank's
operations. The efforts have been amply rewarded. As was noted in the
Bank’s study on Emerging Asia: Changes and Challenges, most Asians have
had their incomes increased and become healthier, better fed, and more
educated, supported by impressive economic growth. However, the challenges that lie ahead are still enormous. Issues of poverty and environmental degradation will require more comprehensive and better-coordinated
programs, linking policies at the macro level to targeted interventions.
There are still some DMCs making the transition from centrally planned
tomarket economies. Further, as DMCs climb the ladder of development,
they face challenges ofa different nature and magnitude, as demonstrated
in the recent financial turmoil in some of the DMCs. Globalization of
economy and development of information technology are making these
challenges extremely complex, although they are benefiting DMCs in
many ways. To assist DMCs effectively in this changing environment, the
Bank cannot help but make its services more broad-based. The importance of the role played by technical assistance will continue to grow.

39Operational Priorities

Strategic development objectives

HROUGHOUT 1997, the Bank continued to pursue the strategic
development objectives identified in its Medium-Term Strategic
Framework (MTSF) (1995-1998), ie., economic growth, reducing

poverty, supporting human development, improving the status of women,
and protecting the environment, in fulfilling the Bank’s mandate to contribute to the sustainable development of the region's countries. Effective
realization of the strategic development objectives was made possible by
maintaining a balance between the strategic objectives and by focusing
on the four operating objectives: policy support; capacity building and
governance for development management; creating/strengthening productive capacity, infrastructure, and services; and regional cooperation.
Achievement of this balance was monitored by the Bank through its
project classification system. For the third consecutive year, the Bank
exceeded its target of a 50:50 split between projects with economic growth
as the primary objective, and projects with social or environmental concerns as the primary or secondary objectives. The share of projects with
social or environmental concerns as the primary or secondary objectives
reached 61 percent in 1997. In terms of volume of lending, these projects
accounted for 56 percent (excluding the large Financial Sector Program
loan to the Republic of Korea) of rotal lending. (See table on Classification
of Projects by Objective, 1994-1997, pages 42-43.)

Nineteen ninety-seven was an exceptional year with several of the
Bank's newly industrialized economies and Southeast Asian developing
member countries (DMCs) undergoing severe financial crises. The Bank
showed considerable flexibility in responding to the crises by contributing
to the emergency assistance packages, both financially and in terms of
guiding DMCs toward needed policy reforms. More generally, the Bank
reaffirmed its role as a broad-based development institution by complementing its traditional role of project financier with support of critical
policy and institutional reforms, particularly in the crucial area of public
sector reforms and support, and financial and capital markets.

Underpinning the Bank's efforts in 1997 to promote the five areas
of strategic priority were several new sector policy initiatives. The Board
approved a policy paper on the fisheries sector which prescribed the use
of sustainability, equity, and efficiency as the primary criteria in the
appraisal and evaluation of fisheries projects. In addition, work continued
on developing policies to recognize and protect the interests of indigenous
peoples and to strengthen the Bank's involvement in the health and water
supply sectors. Efforts were undertaken to enhance existing policies regarding

of a total assistance package amounting to more than $57 billion to be
contributed by ADB, International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank,
and bilateral sources. In addition, the Bank provided $300 million for the

The main objective of the Bank's support of financial and
capital markets reforms was to help restore investor confidence
in the sliort run and develop more stable, more suitably matched
long-term sources of funds to meet critical industrial and
infrastructural needs over the long run, and to improve the efficiency
of resource allocation. Key components of most of the interventions were the creation of an enabling policy environment and a
level playing field; strengthening of the governance, institutions,
regulation, and supervision of the securities markets; improving
and modernizing capital markets infrastructure and linkages;
developing the corporate debt marker; introducing reforms in the
mutual fund industry; and promoting savings through reforms of
the insurance sector, and of pension and provident funds.

The Bank's direct support of policy reform extended well
beyond the financial sector. In the context of its intensified
governance program, for example, the Bank provided two public
sector reform programs to the Marshall Islands and the Federated
States of Micronesia. The Marshall Islands program covered reforms in
civil service and taxation, and the transport sector, to help develop a more
self-reliant economy. The program for the Federated States of Micronesia
is aimed at reducing the size of the public sector and encouraging private
sector involvement through civil service retrenchment and restructuring
of government operations and public enterprises. Attention was paid to
mitigating any adverse social impacts of these reforms. In the Kyrgyz
Republic, a program financed by the Bank focused on improving the
performance of the enterprise sector as a whole through reforms of the
corporate structure, and governance of both public and private enterprises.

 

Technical assistance: The Bank's technical assistance program
continued to support the preparation of numerous projects promoting
economic growth and to assist in policy reforms, institution building, and
the creation of an enabling environment for private sector development.
Examples include technical assistance for investment promotion in the
Pacific DMCs, which assisted improvements in the policy, regulatory, and
institutional frameworks relating to foreign direct investment; and technical assistance complementing the first major power project with private
sector participation in Bangladesh (Meghnaghat Power), which assisted
the Government in developing procedures, guidelines, and documents for
bidding, as well as evaluation of proposals. The Bank also continued to
assist the People's Republic of China in the competitive bidding process
for build-operate-transfer (BOT) power projects using the Changsha BOT
Power Plant in Hunan Province as a pilot project. Technical assistance
was employed to back up subregional growth efforts in the Greater Mekong
Subregion, Central Asian republics, and the recently identified South
Asia Growth Quadrangle (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal).

Finally, among its broad-focused regional initiatives in support of
economic growth, the Bank also provided support for the Asia-PacificEconomie Cooperation (APEC). In 1997, the Bank assisted the developmentof the voluntary guidelines for (i) facilitating private sector participation
in infrastructure development, and (ii) promoting financial and capital
market development, both of which were approved by the APEC Finance
Ministers in Cebu, Philippines. Following these Voluntary Guidelines,
Collaborative Initiatives were agreed under the leadership of various APEC

Agriculture and Natural Resources

1TH RAPID economic development in Asia, the share of agricul
ture in gross domestic product (GDP) has declined across all DMCs.
However, the majority of the region's population continues to reside in rural
areas and, in most of the Bank's DMCs, a large share of the work force is
employed in agriculture and related activities. Agricultural production increases
and growth in the rural economy have provided an important foundation for
the economic transformation in Asia and remain a necessary prerequisite to
sustained and equitable growth of GDP, They are also major factors in the

reduction of poverty and regional inequalities.

The Bank's strategy for agriculture is to improve productivity and
sustainability of existing agricultural systems, to encourage sustainable
use of the natural resource base, to improve market efficiency, and to
promote a viable and self-sustaining rural development process. Economic,
social, and environmental concerns of the DMCs have been integrated
into the program for agriculture. As a result, most loans in the sector
focus on social and environmental issues as cither the primary or secondary objective along with economic growth, The 1997 program, in
particular, reflected the Bank's concerns with poverty reduction, environmental issues, and gender equity. In addition, there has been greater
effort to incorporate capacity-building measures into the design of agricultural projects and to reduce the direct role of governments in
agricultural production or marketing in favor of an expanded role for
private enterprise. In support of the devolution process under way in
many of the Bank’s DMCs, there has also been more emphasis on
promoting the decentralization of decision-making processes from national to regional and local levels and to community/farmer-managed
organizations. This has been of particular relevance in transition
economies, especially the Central Asian republics. Loans in the sector
have included policy reform in the project design, covering both projectspecific and sectoral concerns.

Projects in the agriculture sector, particularly those for natural
resource management, have increasingly incorporated beneficiary par
ticipation, and involvement of nongovernment organizations and local
communities; credit for microenterprise development has been focused

strengthening disclosure standards, securitization, and promoting a free and

Poverty reduction

Poverty reduction is a strategic objective of the Bank. Poverty remains
a trap for more than 950 million people in the Asian and Pacific region,
with a large part of this total facing absolute poverty. The total number
of poor in the region represents nearly three quarters of all the world’s
poor, While the absolute number of poor persons in the region is expected
to decrease gradually, by 2000, the region will still have more than half
of the world’s poor. The roots of poverty lie in a complex fabric of social

Bank’s First Loan for Renewable Energy

N INADEQUATE power supply has emerged as one of the most serious
rastructure constraints in sustainable economic growth in India. Improvements in efficiency of existing facilities and additional investment in
traditional commercial power supply sources alone will not be sufficient to
bridge the demand-supply gap. Further, India’s heavy reliance on coal as a
fuel source for power generation has significant detrimental environmental
impacts. Thus, power systems based on renewable energy sources (RES), such
as wind, solar, bagasse, biomethanation, municipal and agricultural wastes,
and hydro, are suitable candidates for reducing power shortages. Power generation systems, based on RES, can be deployed with much less capital and in
relatively shorter periods of time. RES technologies offer the investment opportunities to small entrepreneurs in power generation and provide alternative
sources of energy that cannot be supplied by the grid. Power generated from
RES is economically attractive when compared with power generated from
commercial energy sources if the economic costs of inputs and the environ
mental costs of the fossil-based generation they displace are considered. The
competitiveness of RES vis-d-vis commercial energy sources rises further
when the electricity tariffs are aligned with the long-run marginal costs.
India's experience in the application of RES technologies is about 20 years
old and is the most extensive among the Bank's developing member countries, with the possible exception of the PRC. The share of renewable energy
in India at present is about 1,200 megawatts (MW), constituting just over
I percent of the overall generating capacity in the country, By 2005, an
additional 2,200 MW is expected to be generated utilizing RES technologies.
Although the potential supply of RES in India is significant, the pace and
magnitude of commercialization has been slow. The lack of access by users
and developers to appropriate financing mechanisms has been a constraint to
RES adoption. The lack of a commercial market base has prevented a faster
buildup of the necessary infrastructure support and has inhibited the opportunities for expanding the production of these systems. Policy measures,
adopted recently by the Government of India, will facilitate the expansion ofOperational Priorities

 

and economic factors, making poverty reduction one
of the most persistent development challenges the
Bank addresses. Further exacerbating the challenge
of poverty is that, with its complexity and multifacered nature, there is difficulty in defining and
measuring its many aspects.

Poverty reduction has been an implicit element
of all operations since the Bank was established. The
Bank pays close attention to poverty reduction issues
in the formulation and implementation of its project
and technical assistance activities. The Bank also
provides support for policy reform in individual countries that would provide more opportunities for the
poor. In terms of specific projects, during 1997 two
projects approved had poverty reduction as a specific

primary objective: the Rural Income Generation Project in Indonesia and

RES. Principal among these sire reform measures toward a pricing policy thar
reflects more closely the economic costs of commercial energy supply, the
trade and industrial policy reforms, and the entry of the private sector to
augment power generation capacity. These policy instruments will accelerate
the commercialization and use of RES.

The Bank's policy for the renewable energy sector supports the developnient of RES and recommends assistance for programs that are economically
and financially viable. By supporting the development of RES, of which India
has substantial potential, Bank assistance will offer an important contribution
ro address India’s power shortages, reduce the energy sector dependence on
fossil fuel, develop an environment-friendly energy supply through renewable
sources, and prevent depletion of India’s limited resources including forests.
The Bank implemented a $100 million loan (which had been approved in late
1996) to support the Government's plan for expanding the development of
four major RES technologies: biomethanation for production of energy, bagassebased cogeneration of power, wind energy development, and solar-thermal
system; and for facilitating the transition of RES technologies to mainstream status, The Bank-funded project will tap financial and managerial
resources from the private sector and help promote environmentally sound

investments in small-scale power generation using RES technologies, The
Bank Joan, onlent to private entrepreneurs at commercial terms, will
facilitate the generation of about 125 MW equivalent which wilh reduce
coal consumption in the country by abour 625,000 tons per year, and
improve proportionately the air and water quality. Provisions have been
made for capacity building of the institutions tasked with promoting and
financing RES technologies in India. This is the Bank's first loan in the
renewable energy sector. It may serve as a model for replication in other
DMCs of the Bank in formulating appropriate regulatory and institutional
framework, as well as designing an economically, financially, and technically
viable program for RES development to meet Asia's needs for sustainable
human and economic development.

 

Heightened concer for poverty reduction has
led the Bank to undertake projects that increase
incomes and provide jobs.

the D.G. Khan Rural Development Project in Pakistan. Ten additional
projects had poverty reduction as a secondary objective.

One approach in the Bank's poverty reduction efforts is the promotion of broad-based economic growth and support for targeted interventions. This approach is based on the experience of countries that
have been most successful in reclucing poverty. Sustained rates of economic growth, in turn, provide opportunities for the poor to participate
in and benefit from this growth. Support for basic social services,
particularly in education and health, helps the poor participate more
effectively,

At the same time, the Bank pursues poverty reduction through initiatives that are oriented toward the needs of specific countries. These
initiatives are based on particular country-level conditions and concerns
and have a specific country-based focus. Poverty reduction efforts increasingly are becoming an element of country strategy studies and country
programming processes.

During 1997, the Bank undertook a range of initiatives addressing
poverty reduction. The Bank is an active member of the broad-based
Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), and during the year
hosted a CGAP meeting at Bank Headquarters in Manila. Similarly, the
Bank actively participated in the international Microcredit Summit, held
in Washington, DC. Within the Bank, efforts were maintained to shift
the focus of project design, monitoring, and evaluation away from emphasis on project inputs and toward emphasis on project outputs, benefits,
and impact. Studies are under way on a variety of poverty issues, both
urban and rural. The Bank also undertook assessments of the impact of
policy-based lending on the poor and methods to measure the overall
effects of the Bank's operations on the poor. Staff training in poverty
reduction issues is being provided, including assignment to externel institutions such as the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh,

The Bank currently is engaged in a review of its overall strategies and
policies for poverty reduction, with a view to drafting a guiding policy on
poverty reduction. This will be a significant effort involving both the Bank
and its DMCs. A series of country-level consultation meetings are planned,
to broaden the perspective on this central question of development.

Supporting human development

The Bank has continued to emphasize its strategic objective of promoting
human development by expanding investments in the critical sectors of
education, health and nutrition, water supply and sanitation, and urban
development. Human development is an expanding area of activity for
the Bank. Of a total of 72 public sector projects approved during 1997,
excluding private sector and engineering technical assistance loans,
26 projects were for social infrastructure projects, with human development as the primary aim for 23 projects.

Supporting human development is not only a means to achieving
sustainable and long-term development, butis also an end in itself, Sustained
economic growth requires educated, skilled, and healthy people. Az the
same time, the objectives of reducing poverty, meeting basic needs, and. —

providing access to a berter quality of life now and for future
generations cannot be achieved without investing in human
development.

Bank projects and technical assistance support improvements
in access to, and quality of, human development services. The
poor and women are priority target groups for most of these
projects. The Bank is paying greater attention to promoting private sector participation in the financing and provision of human
development-related services. More effective financing mechanisms for these services are given high priority, as is greater
decentralization and devolution of authority to local governments,
Special emphasis is being given to issues related to governance
and management capacity of social sector services. Some examples of Bank activities in human development follow,

 

Education: The Bank aims to support the education sector
in its DMCs by investing in basic education, improving the quality
of education, and making education in general — and skills training in particular — more relevant to market needs. Consistent with
the Bank's goal of investing in projects with the highest returns,
new Bank projects in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kazakstan, Uzbekistan,
and Viet Nam emphasize basic education, A project in Indonesia aims to
improve the quality and management of, and access to school for students
in poor rural areas. Bank projects in Malaysia and Sri Lanka focus on
improving the quality of technical and higher education systems to address
the key constraint of shortage of engineers and technically skilled labor,
A sector development project in the Kyrgyz Republic supports a
comprehensive review of education sector policies and provides investments
for education infrastructure. A project in Uzbekistan supports the development of textbooks in basic education, incorporating new areas of knowledge and skills required for the transition to a market economy.

The Bank's technical assistance is supporting the preparation of
education projects in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Maldives,
Pakistan, Philippines, and Viet Nam, Efforts in Indonesia and Vier Nam
support improvements in the quality of education through teacher training In the Lao PDR and Pakistan, the Bank's assistance specifically
targets women, girls, and ethnic minorities. Technical assistance in the
Philippines focuses on basic education development in the Mindanao
region. In addition, the Bank is supporting capacity development in the
education sector in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyz
Republic, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Uzbekistan. These efforts
include strengthening administration and management at the central and
local levels, developing education information and monitoring systems,
reviewing technical education and skills training, supporting decentralization, and improving capacity for textbook production.

A regional technical assistance (RETA) grant is examining recent
trends, issues, and policies in education to help assess the evolving role
of the Bank in the sector. This will provide the basis for developing a new
education policy for the Bank. Another RETA grant will explore the
potential for using the power of mass media for improving the human

capital of the disadvantaged, including women, people from ethnic minorities, the disabled, and the poor. See also Table 10 in the Statistical
Annex.

Health and nutrition: The Bank's main strategies for supporting the
health improvement efforts of its DMCs are focused on primary health
care services, control of communicable diseases, and capacity building.
An innovative Bank project in Bangladesh seeks to improve the provision
of primary health care in four large urban areas by contracting out services
to NGOs and the private sector (see box on page 55). A new project in
Indonesia supports government efforts to control communicable diseases,
since such efforts have large positive externalities and target the poor. A
sector development program in Mongolia is supporting the comprehensive
reform of health sector policies, including the introduction of private
sector delivery of health services and key investments. In a sector development program in Papua New Guinea, the focus is on introducing key
reforms in the health care delivery system, including the establishment
of a competency-based health personnel training system.

A technical assistance grant in Pakistan supports the development
of a project specifically designed to meet the needs of rural women.
Technical assistance grants in Bangladesh, Cambodia,
Indonesia, and Mongolia build institutional capacity.
A technical assistance grant in Papua New Guinea
seeks to link expenditure in the health sector with
health status.

ARETA has developed the draft of a new health
policy for the Bank based on extensive review of the
health priorities and policies of DMCs, The draft
policy will be reviewed before being presented to the
Board for consideration in 1998. A RETA partly
supported the organization of the Fourth International Congress on HIV/AIDS (human immuno deficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome)
in Asia and the Pacific. The Bank also financed a
regional technical assistance in the Greater Mekong
Subregion to identify viable projects addressing the
issues related to HIV/AIDS in the region, A RETA
was provided to develop investment priorities to reduce child malnutrition
in eight countries and to assist in developing a Bank nutrition policy
paper.

Water supply and sanitation: ‘Ihe Bank's main objective for the
water supply and sanitation subsector is to increase the availability of safe
drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities. Appropriate water and
sanitation services are essential for the health and well-being of the
population; and the provision of such services should be cost-effective,
sustainable, and affordable. In addition to financing stand-alone projects,
the Bank typically incorporates water supply and sanitation components
into integrated urban development projects to provide a balanced package
of development benefits. The Bank also supports institutional strengtheningand capacity-building programs aimed at improving service provision,
financial management, cost recovery, and facility maintenance. Private
sector participation, environmental protection, and involvement of NGOs
and local communities in project selection, design, and implementation
are promoted and were continued in 1997.

Following the Bank's regional water policy consultations in 1996,
preparation of the Bank's water sector policy paper continued in 1997,

In June 1997, the Bank hosted a meeting on water resources management in Southeast Asian countries together with the Global Water
Partnership. Asa result of this meeting, the heads of state of the Association
of Southezst Asian Nations (ASEAN) approved an initiative to increase
water sector cooperation among ASEAN member countries during their
summit in December 1997.

In 1997, the Bank approved a water supply project in the PRC which
will supply water to three urban areas in Zhejiang Province, provide
irrigation water to surrounding rice fields, improve flood protection, generate
hydroelectricity for the Wenzhou grid, and build the capacity of local
resettlement bureaus. In Indonesia, a capacity-building project for water
supply enterprises to improve water loss reduction was approved, focusing
not only on physical infrastructure but also on a broad range of related
administrative and management aspects to enhance the cost effectiveness
of services. In Thailand, a project will provide water supply facilities to
the two provincial capitals of Nong Khai and Udon Thani as well as
12 major villages that are currently without piped water. In Sri Lanka,
another project will provide improvements to the urban and rural water
supply and sanitation systems in six districts, benefiting about one million
people. In this project, the Bank loan will also leverage significant sector
reforms through the introduction of private sector management of water
supply and sewerage in Greater Colombo. The Bank also approved a
wastewater management project in Pakistan which will finance infrastructure for wastewater collection and treatment in the Korangi/Landhi area,
Karachi. In Viet Nam, a Bank-funded project will expand the availability
of piped water supplies and sanitation facilities to households, businesses,
industries, and institutions in seven dispersed provincial towns.

Technical assistance activity in the water supply and sanitation subsector
during 1997 covered PRC, Indonesia, Kiribati, Philippines, and Thailand.
Advisory technical assistance focused on cost-recovery studies and reforms,
as well as capacity-building support, including private sector participation. In the PRC, technical assistance was provided to help package what
will be the first build-operate-transfer (BOT) water supply project in the
country, locaced in Chengdu, Shichuan Province. The Bank also published the Second Water Utilities Data Book for the Asian and Pacific Region,
which provides information on 50 water utilities in 31 DMCs. The Data
Book was launched and made available to the public at the Fourth Global
Forum of the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council in
November, for which the Bank served as cosponsor.

Urban development: Addressing the rapid pace of urbanization
throughout Asia is a formidable challenge facing the majority of the
Bank's DMCs. The Bank encourages an integrated approach to urban

and services, targeted at meeting the basic needs and improving the living
conditions of the urban poor. Subsectors incorporated into integrated
urban development projects include water supply and sanitation, solid
waste management, flood control, drain:
development, slum improvements, and low-income housing, The Bank
considers institutional capacity building as essential for promoting the
efficient delivery, management, and maintenance of urban services ona

pecially in the water supply, wastewater, and solid waste

 

 

projects introduce relevant institutions and agencies to different techniques and approaches for recovering costs, mobilizing local resources,
and collecting revenues.

During 1997, the Bank approved an integrated urban development
project in the Lao PDR which will support the development of primary
urban infrastructure in the four largest secondary towns of Luang Prabang,
Pakse, Savannakhet, and Thakhet. The project also includes an extensive
capacity-building component aimed at strengthening the urban services
management capabilities of local administrations. The Bank also approved
a housing finance project for India which is designed to (i) expand the
national housing finance system by establishing lending linkayes between
the formal housing finance sector and community-based finance institutions, thereby increasing access to housing finance by low-income households; (ii) increase the av

and private sector capital; (iii) support innovative projects for low-income

 

ilability of housing finance by leveraging public

 

housing and slum improvement; and (iv) expedite policy reforms in the
sector to alleviate existing constraints to effective housing delivery.

In Indonesia, the Bank's first stand-alone urban sector capacity
 

building project was approved to improve the effectiveness and efficiency
of urban infrastructure through a combination of human development,
institutional strengthening, and policy and implementation support. In
addition, an integrated urban development project was approved for Metro
Medan, which complemented the Bank's two earlier projects for Medan,
accommodating the metropolitan nature of urban growth in the area in
a regional context and emphasizing public-private partnerships. In Mongolia,
the Bank approved its first urban sector project for provision of urban
services to five provincial capitals in western and northwestern provinces.
The project focus is on a variety of basic urban services, promoting

appropriate and sustainable technologies and involving local communi
 

ties. The project also has an associated technical assistance for capacity
building. In the Philippines, a project for the development of the munici
palities around the Subic Bay area was approved to provide urban infra
 

 

structure, as well as strengthen the institutional capacity of the local
government units concerned.

Urban sector technical assistance was approved to prepare integrated
urban development projects in Bangladesh, India, Philippines, and Sri Lanka.
The Bank also approved a project to develop a revolving loan fund in
India to finance commercially viable urban and environmental infrastructure projects that include private sector participation. Moreover, in 1997,_—
NN eee ee enna ee een, eee =

technical assistance was primarily directed toward capacity-building programs
in the areas of urban management and private sector participation in the
delivery of urban services. In Mongolia, technical assistance was provided
to review housing sector laws and strategies which form the basis for more
substantial work in the sector. A RETA was approved to address a number
of urban development and housing issues, including best practices for
promoting private sector investment in infrastructure, and the status of
mortgage-backed securities markets in DMCs.

In the Pacific DMCs, Bank assistance for urban development, including water supply and sanitation, was integrated into a framework of national
economic and policy reforms. The thrust of these reforms is improved selfreliance, and the Bank is encouraging corporatization and private sector
participation to translate this objective into the urban development subsector.
In 1997, the Bank implemented technical assistance for the management of
water supply and sanitation services in Fiji and for the corporatization of public
utilities in Kiribati. Institutional, policy, and fiscal reforms are important
components of water supply and sanitation projects currently under
implementation in the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia,
and in a housing and urban infrastructure project under consideration in
Samoa, Reforms are supported by technical assistance for capacity building, and development objectives are being identified.

Gender and development

Improving the status of women is one of the strategic objectives of the
Bank. Gender and development is no longer seen as merely an issue of
human rights or social justice; investment in women is now widely reeognized as crucial to achieving sustainable development. Economic analysis recognizes thar low levels of education and training, poor health and
nutritional status, and limited access to resources not only depress the
quality of life for women, bur also limit the productivity of women and
their contribution to economic efficiency, growth, and development. Public
policies and investments that raise the status of women have specific
benefits such as improved public health, lower infant and maternal mortality,
lower fertility rates, increased life expectancy, and reduced welfare costs.
Development programs that include measures to expand economic opportunities for women and increase their incomes, combined with efforts to
improve women's health and education, result in greater economic efficiency and decreased levels of poverty. Discrimination against women,
whether in the household, in the public realm, or in markets, carries both
personal costs for the individual and social and economic costs for society
at large.

The Bank’s first policy on women in development was adopted in
1985. The initial approach under this policy was to implement a range
of activities within its regular operational program that cited women as
a specific target group. Emphasis was placed on the provision of finance
for projects in areas such as social infrastructure that would benefit women
directly, as well as projects in agriculture, rural development, and small-scale
industry that would create income-earning and employment opportunities
for women.

Women are increasingly assuming nontraditional
roles in development.

54

By 1992, the Bank's approaches to improving the status of women
were strengthened and gained momentum when they were included as one
of the Bank's five strategic development objectives. Through this increased
emphasis, women in development was brought into the mainstream of the
Bank's development agenda. In all its operations, women's concerns and
vender analysis came to be addressed systematically, and operational procedures to guide staff in addressing women’s issues were developed.

During 1997, substantial efforts toward consideration of women's issues
and development were undertaken, including revision and updating of the
1985 policy on women in development. The Bank is considering a4 number
of steps to strengthen the Bank's involvement in gender and development.

A major focus in the relationship between women’s issues and development activities has been the identification of projects addressing
women or mainstreaming women’s concerns. At the same time, through
regional technical assistance, the Bank has undertaken a number of sector
studies dealing with women's issues. The Bank has moved to integrate
consideration of women's issues in its macroeconomic work, particularly
in its country operational strategies and country programming. This step
is key to ensuring that gender-based issues are addressed systematically
inall Bank operations. Country briefing papers addressing women's issues
now are prepared concurrently with the country operational strategy to
ensure that gender-based issues are mainstreamed into the country programming processes. In addition, the country operational strategy now
includes a separate strategy for women that clearly identifies and elaborates on how, at the country level, the Bank will operationalize the
strategic objective of improving the status of women.

Ongoing regional technical assistance projects addressing women's
concerns include the Low-Income Women Entrepreneurs in Asia project,
covering six countries; the Socio-Legal Status of Women in Selected
DMCs project, covering four countries in Southeast Asia; and the Institutional Strengthening of Women’s NGOs project, covering seven countries. A regional workshop at ADB headquarters under the Socio-Legal
Status of Women project brought together leaders in the field of women’s
issues to discuss country-level and regional strategies to improve the
socio-legal status of women.

In 1997, two projects were assigned women in development as their
primary project classification. These were the Participatory Livestock
Project and the Urban Primary Health Care Project, both in Bangladesh
(see box at right).

Environment

The Bank's commitment to the principles of sustainable development and
environment protection is one of the primary strategic objectives of the
Bank.

The Bank's major environmental activities in 1997 included
(i) providing financial and technical assistance to facilitate institutional
and policy reforms, and build staff capacity in environmental agencies,
enabling staff to carry out effectively their mandate for environmental
protection and management; (ii) promoting cooperation among countriesin the region or subregion to address transboundary environmental concerns, and to enhance possible environmental benefits occurring from
subregional cooperation; (iii) ensuring, through the use of environmental
assessment and review procedures, that Bank-funded projects are environmentally sustainable; (iv) financing projects that promote sound management of natural resources, and rehabilitate and protect the environment;
(v) undertaking resource center activities to enhance Bank staff and
DMC staff awareness on current and emerging environmental issues; and
(vi) ensuring interagency collaboration to avoid costly duplication of
efforts, and to enable the Bank to focus its assistance in critical areas.

The Bank’s achievements in 1997 were in the following areas:
(i) capacity building of environmental institutions or agencies in key
ministries; (ii) preparing investment projects with environmental objectives;
(if) conducting comprehensive environmental impact assessment to ensure
that impacts of development projects on environment are within acceptable levels; (iv) promoting subregional and interagency cooperation on

Bangladesh’s Urban Primary Health Care Project:
An Innovation in Health Care Provision

Boe URBAN poor suffer from the worst health
conditions in the country and the situation is likely to
worsen since most of the growth in the urban population is
concentrated among the poor. The primary health care (PHC)
system thar can help improve the health of the urban poor is
severely underdeveloped and cannot provide urgently needed
services.

As part of the Urban Primary Health Care Project in
Bangladesh, the Bank is supporting the testing of an innovation
wherein the provision of PHC services is contracted 19 NGOs
ond the private sector, The Government has developed a package
of essential health services which includes immunization, micronutrient support, family planning, prenatal care, basic curative care, and health education. NGOs and private sector groups
will be invited to bid on providing these services in defined
geographical areas in the four major cities of Bangladesh:
Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, and Rajshahi, Each area will
comprise about 500,000 people with ten health centers tw be
constructed under the Project. The successful bidders will be
able to use government health centers and equipment, and will
be responsible for delivering services up to standards established by the Government. Performance of the NGOs will be
monitored by regular supervisory visits and be carefully evaluated using household and health tacility surveys. Performance
bonuses, directly linked with the achievement of tangible results, will be paid to successful contractors. Performance assessment will include examining whether the urban poor are receiving the full benefits of these services.

There are a number of reasons for believing that contracting for health services will be successful.

(i) There is greater focus on achieving rangible results
because payment is linked with measurable accom:
plishments.

(ii) The tendering process uses competition to improve
quality and promote efficiency, Contractors have a
clear motivation to contain their costs,

(iti) The contracting mechanism allows for greater flexibility
in responding to new requirements and changing circumstances.

(iv) The experiences of NGOs and other groups can be
mobilized to improve service delivery and build the
capacity of public sector managers.

(v) Governments can devolve day-to-day management to
the contractors and focus instead on financing and
regulating health services.

(vi) Health and family planning services will become integrated because the contractor is required to provide all
services under one roof.

To evaluate whether these expected advantages are real, a
rigorous pilot test will be carried out. The Project will define
20 carchment areas and carry our baseline surveys in each.
Fifteen areas will be randomly selected to participate in the
contracting out of services and the remaining five areas will
serve as a comparison group. The City Corporations will continue to be responsible for service delivery in the comparison
areas. Follow-up household and health facility surveys will be
carried out after four years and the results used to assess the
effectiveness, costs, and efficiency of contracting out health
services.

Environmental Challenges
in the 21% Century

| Poipamiaied WAS one of the major themes of the Bank's study on Emerging Asia: Changes and Challenges. The study
shows that Asia's environment record is dismal, Asia’s environment has become so polluted and degraded that it poses a threat not
just to the quality of life of its people but also
to economic growth, The costs of this environmental neglect are massive.

Many argue that Asia cannot spare the
resources needed to clean up its environment. But the solution to Asia’s environmental problems does not lie in a mammoth environmental bureaucracy charged with the
responsibility of investing billions of dollars
in environmental infrastructure. Rather, what
is needed is a redeployment of existing resources within the public sector to ensure
thar environmental issues are fully reflected
in macreconomic and sectoral polictes. The
environment should be regarded us a dimension that cuts across sectors, policies, and
institutions. The energies of both the private
sector and civil society must also be better
harnessed for environmental management.

Unfortunately, Asia’s environment is
likely to get much worse before it gers berter.
Most economies are still a long way from the
point where rising incomes will create the
demands for better environmental standards,
and induce a shift in economic structure 1ward less polluting economic activities. However, it would be wrong to conclude thar
economic growth per se is the cause of Asia's
environmental woes. The major culprits are
failed policies and institutions, and reckless
neglect.

How tw improve policies and establish
efficient and effective institutions are expected
to be among the major challenges of the 21"
century, Other challenges include environmental improvement in megacities,
environmental enhancement in the rural arcas due ty poverty, addressing trade- and
environment-related issues, compliance to
commitments under international conventions
and weaties, and transfer of environmental
technology,

56

selected environmental themes; and (v) undertaking key environmental
studies and training activities of interest to the Bank and its DMCs.

Financial and technical assistance amounting to over $5 million were
provided to PRC, Kyrgyz Republic, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Uzbekistan to
build or strengthen their environmental institutions or agencies in key
line ministries. The primary objective of Bank assistance was to enable
these institutions to carry out their mandate for environmental prorection. Specifically, the Bank assisted in building human capacity in environmental impact assessment and planning through training and education
programs; developing guidelines, systems, and procedures for environmental appraisal; improving the administration of environmental impact
assessment requirements of governments; and developing environmental
monitoring and enforcement capacity. The Bank also assisted three provinces in the PRC by conducting sector- and industry-specific analyses of
the suitability of different market-based instruments to achieve effective
environmental management.

The Bank funded various technical assistance projects amounting to
nearly $20 million, aimed at improving the efficiency of resource management and pollution prevention and control in the agriculture, fisheries, forestry, water resources, energy, and industry sectors. The Bank also
provided technical assistance to study the establishment of a national
biodiversity information network in Indonesia; strengthen urban waste
management policies and strategies in Indonesia; promote industrial pollution
control management in Malaysia; strengthen land use policies in Mongolia;
implement the pesticides regulatory framework in Nepal; improve air
quality in Metro Manila, Philippines; and rehabilitate and manage the
Pasig River, also in Metro Manila. In the PRC, the Bank's technical
assistance covered capacity-building activities for energy conservation,
wastewater treatment operations, identification of financing mechanisms
for energy efficiency investment, environmental improvement in wo provinces, and a study of clean-coal integrated gasification combined-cycle
technology, Various technical assistance projects focused on coastal environmental management and urban development in Karnataka, India; fisheries
management in the Marshall Islands; capacity building for waste management administration in Thailand; and environmental improvement in
Ho Chi Minh City, and water resource management in the Red River
basin, both in Viet Nam.

In the area of regional cooperation, the Bank continued to assist the
Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) member countries to enhance their
institutional and staff capacity in environmental planning and management,
The GMS working group meeting on environment was held at Siem Reap,
Cambodia; NGOs as well as working group members attended. The Bank
conducted a participatory approach workshop on the development of
strategies and policies for environmental management in GMS, The Bank
also continued to assist various DMCs in addressing regional and global
environmental concerns such as climate change and acid rain-related
issues. The Bank has responded through rechnical assistance to the request
of the Government of Indonesia and ASEAN Secretariat in addressing
the forest fires in Indonesia as well as in the preparation of transboundary

haze action plan. (See box on page 58.)To ensure that Bank-funded projects are environmentally sustainable,
the Bank reviewed all 1997 projects for potential environmental impacts.
The Bank actively sought to include environmental provisions in project,
sector, and program loans, including loans involving development finance
institutions. In 1997, a total of 20 summary environmental impact assessment (EIA) reports were circulated 120 days before the ADB Board of
Directors’ consideration of the respective projects, giving interested groups
another opportunity to comment on the environmental aspects of the
projects. Queries forwarded to the Bank concerning some of these projects
were resolved. Also, the Bank continued its initiative, which was started
two years ago, of undertaking environmental economic analysis on a
number of projects. Expanded analysis was found to improve the economic internal rate of return of these projects.

This year, increased emphasis was placed on ELA compliance-monitoring
of projects. Seven projects, mostly hydropower projects in the Lao PDR
and Nepal, were closely reviewed and monitored. By participating in
various project completion and postevaluation missions, the Bank’s environment specialists also identified various lessons which will be fed
into similar projects upstream of loan processing.

The Bank's attention was focused on the prevention, abatement, and
mitigation of potential environmental impacts of projects, as well as on
programming projects with environmental objectives and on improving
project design to enhance further environmental benefits. This year, the
Bank approved over $378.8 million in loan projects with environmental
objectives; three loan projects in PRC, Indonesia, and India were on
ordinary capital resources terms. Situated in various biogeographic
ecosystems, these projects comprise upland watershed management, coastal
community development and fisheries resource management, ports rehabilitation, and urban environmental improvement. For example, the Upper
Warershed Management Project in Sri Lanka is expected to protect the
environment and reduce poverty in the project area. Specifically, it will
rehabilitate and sustainably manage and protect critical watersheds, improve
income of project beneficiaries, and facilitare the establishment of a mediumto long-term watershed management policy. The Forestry Sector Project
in Vier Nam, designed with target beneficiary participation in the planning and implementation of various activities, will restore the vegetative
cover of the hilly and mountainous areas in critical watersheds and raise
the productivity of the country’s forestry resources.

In the Philippines, the Bank is supporting the Government's efforts
to achieve sustainable development of the fisheries sector and poverty
reduction among the local fisherfolk. The project will establish and implement a set of fisheries resource management systems, promote income
diversification, and strengthen the institutional capacity of the public
agencies in charge of fisheries resource management.

In Indonesia, Bank assistance will promote the sustainable management
of coastal fisheries resources, and reduce the extensive poverty in coastal
areas by providing opportunities for increasing income and improving the
living standards of coastal communities. The Bank will also assist in
rehabilitating two major ports in India — the Mumbai and Chennai ports.
Aside from supporting the commercialization and corporatization of selected

Operational Priorities

Measuring Environmental Quality
in Asia

N 1996, the Bank, in collaboration with

darvard University, completed a research
study on environmental indicators. Three sets
of indexes for monitoring environmental
changes were developed: cost of remediation,
environmental elasticity, and environmental
diamond,

The cost of remediation reflects the cost
of moving the environment from its present
stare to a more desirable level in: the future.
This index has strong policy implications for
nutional governments and multifinance institutions since it reveals the amount of wealth
that a society has to forego wo restore the
environment to a more livable level. The
index relates environment two the cost of
repairing damages done to it in dollar terms.

Environmental elasticity is a dynamic ratio
that measures the percentage change of an
aggregate measure of environmental quality
for every L percent increase of » country’s per
capita GDP. The enyironmental changes are
generally defined. by several selected environmental indicators and are aggregated
through 9 weighting scheme.

The environmental diamond measures
and presents the stare of the environment
graphically, in terms of overall quality of air,
woter, land, and ecosystem. This indicator
reveals a general picture without concealing
the multiple dimensions of the environment.

The three indexes can be used by
multifinonce institutions and governments in
determining the state of the environment,
the rare of environmental degradation as
compared to economic growth, and the costs
of improving the environment. In terms ot
environmental investments, multifinance
institutions may give added emphasis ro countries with high cost-of-remediation/GDP ratios
and negative environmental trends, The green
side of environmental degradation (lind and
ecosystem) should receive greater attention
and investments. Systematic and standardized data gathering, however, should constitute a priority for the Bank's DMCs,

major ports and a privatization policy for the port sector, the project will
replace old submarine oil pipelines, which are leaking and causing serious
environmental damage. The Bank also approved financing for improvement
of the urban environment of selected areas in Lao PDR, Pakistan, and
Viet Nam through the development of appropriate urban infrastructure and
effective and sustainable management of urban services. In the PRC, the Bank
approved a project to promote sustainable regional development by supporting

Land and Forest Fires in Indonesia and the Bank’s Response

ONG-TERM climate variability (glacial versus nonglacial
limste) and short-term climate oscillations caused by the
El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) have regularly created
conditions thar make even rainforests vulnerable to wildfires.
El Nifio is a global climate phenomenon that occurs every two
to seven years, and lasts up to 18 months. The onset of EL Nitto
is indicated by warming of the surface waters in the eastern
Pacific near the equator, which dramatically rearranges global
wind and rainfall patterns. The present episode of El Nifo
started in early March 1997 and may continue into May 1998.
Fire is also linked to human interventions, which include
(i) temporary forest conversion by traditional slash-and-burm
systems; (li) permanent forest conversion for the establishment
of agriculture, including estate crops, food crops, horticulture,
and livestock; (iii) conversion of natural forest (mainly exploited
or otherwise degraded secondary forest) into industrial umber
plantations; (iv) drainage of peat swamps; and (v) wildfires
(fires escaping from land clearing or land preparation fires into
surrounding natural forests, peat lands, and plantations),
Prolonged droughrs during previous El Nifio events in 19821983, 1987, 1991, 1994, and 1997 favored land-clearing activities as well as the spread of fires into standing forests and coal
and peat areas, with consequent emission of smoke and development of transboundary haze pollution, The smoke emitred
trom the Indonesian archipelago in 1987, 1991, 1994, and 1997
came mainly from land-clearing or land preparation fires and
forest land-conversion fires. The forest area burned from year
to year is reported to be strongly related to the increasing
length of the dry season, and since 1987 it has increased with
each successive extended dry period. During 1997, more than
1,000 fires have affected an area estimated to range from
300,000 hectares (ha) to over | million ha. The smoke emitted
from these fires concentrated into.a regional haze plume due to
the abnormal wind pattern associated with ENSO. The haze
that engulfed the region caused enormous health and safery
problems in Indonesia and its neighboring countries, particularly in Malaysia and Singapore. The haze resulted in the worst
pollution ever recorded in Southeast Asia, with visibility reduced to several meters for several months. In the city of
Kuching (Malaysia), the Government was close to evacuating
its 400,000 inhabitants. Health officials estimated thar in
Indonesia alone, some 20 million people suffered from smoke
58

and haze-related health problems. In the region, the haze also
caused disruptions in international air traffic, including closure
of uirports and cancellation of flights, as well as disruptions in
river transport in Borneo and marine traffic, e.g. in the Strait
of Malacea. Besides the economic losses due to closure of
airports, cancellation of flights, and aircraft and maritime accidents, the haze alsy had negative impacts on the tourism sector
of Indonesia and neighboring countries.

In view of the severity of land and forest fires in Indonesia
and the associated smoke and haze pollution in the region, and
its impact on the regional economy, the Bank fielded several
missions to Indonesia in 1997 to determine the need for Bank
support. Following consultations with senior officials of the
Association of Southeast Asian (ASEAN) Secretariat and the
Government of Indonesia, and in response to the ASEAN
Environment Ministers’ Jakarta Declaration on Environment
and Development (18 September 1997), the Bank is considering a two-pronged prevention and control approach in tackling
the environmental consequences of these fires, This approach
comprises provision of $1 million through a regional technical
assistance (RETA) grant to assist ASEAN in strengthening its
capacity to prevent and mitigate transboundary pollution, including haze. The proposed RETA will help formalize the cooperation between affected countries through implementation
of the recently completed Regional Haze Action Plan. Ir will
complement and reinforce, at the regional level, a nationallevel initiative through an advisory technical assistance (ADTA)
grant of $1 million to Indonesia, The ADTA is being designed
fo estimate the economic damage caused by the 1997 fires to
provide a basis for policy change, and identify investments
needed tor the prevention and mitigation of forest fires at the
country level.

Because of social, environmental, and economie impacts
associated with the El Nitto phenomenon, the Bank is also
undertaking an internal study in the Philippines and Indonesia,
in particular Irian Jaya Province. The emphasis of the study is
on the effects of the El Nino phenomenon at the local level in
socioeconomic terms. The information generated will be organized, analyzed, and presented in-a form: thar will enable the
Bank and other donors to develop a clear view of current and
future development options to address the socioeconomic and
environmental impacts associated with El Nifio,Operational Priorities

Shaanxi Province in implementing its environmental plan for improving the
ambient air quality in Xi'an, Xianyang, and Tongchuan cities.

The Bank also undertook several resource center activities, To build
the environmental management capacity of DMCs, studies focused on the
use of market-based instruments in environmental management in Indonesia
and the Philippines; and development of environmental indicators and
indexes to aid in policy and decision making. Environmental profiles of
Kazakstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan were prepared to improve the
understanding of the environmental problems in these economies. Other
studies focused on environmental compliance and enforcement, and government nonformal sector cooperation in protected area management. A
compilation of environmental economic case studies was also undertaken
for selected Bank projects. Seminars and training for Bank staff covered
various topics such as the El Nifio phenomenon and its impacts in Asia,
least-cost greenhouse gas abatement strategy, environmental issues in the
GMS, and environmental considerations in agriculture and energy sectors. To share its experiences and exchange views on key regional or
country-specific environmental issues, the Bank cofinanced projects with
various organizations, including the Economic and Social Commission for
Asia and the Pacific, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations
Environment Programme, multilateral financial institutions, and several bilateral organizations. The Bank also participated actively in selected seminars,
workshops, and meetings within and outside the region, such as the Conference of the Parties at Kyoto, Japan, APEC Environmental Workshop at
Vancouver, Canada, and Eco-Asia at Tokyo, Japan.

The Bank also completed a major study on “Measuring Environmental
Quality in Asia” which has been well received (see box on page 57), For
environment indicators, see Table 9 in the Statistical Annex.

Governance: sound development management

In 1997, the Bank expanded its activities on issues of governance and capacity
building. Part of this effort has been to further the conceptual discussion on
what governance entails and how it is related to capacity building.

A certain amount of ambiguity is inevitable in

Capacity building aims to strengthen the
institutional environment for more efficient,
effective, and sustainable development.

 

an area as vast as good governance and capacity
building. The subtitle of the Bank's Board paper
identified governance with “sound development
management.” “Governance” has been defined as “the
manner in which power is exercised in the management of a country’s social and economic resources for
development.” These definitions, although very broad,
make clear that governance has to do with the manner
in which policies and decisions are defined and implemented, and not with the policies or decisions themselves. This is why the key elements of good governance
are identified as (i) accountability of public officials;
(ii) participation in decision making; (iii) transparency
of information; and (iv) predictability, particularly

 

 

59ANNUAL REPORT 1997

nn ——————— ___—EEOEOEOEOEOEOEEEeEEeE—__

through the rule of law. Thus, “good governance” is characterized by
decision-making processes that hold individuals accountable for their
decisions; encourage appropriate participation by those concerned; facilitate the flow of information; and rely on open and clear rules, fairly and
uniformly enforced.

Conceptually, capacity building has three key elements: (i) institutional
development, i¢., a move from a less efficient to a more efficient set of
functions and rules; (ii) organizational development, or the evolution of
organizational forms better suited to the new functions and rules; and
(iii) human resource development training. Accordingly, while every
program, sector strategy, or project should have an appropriate capacitybuilding component, not all projects are good vehicles for governance
improvement, and only a few activities (usually called public sector
management) have governance improvement as their central objective.

Substantial policy development, consistent with the governance policy,
has taken place in the Bank in 1997. This concerns particularly the
preparatory work for an anticorruption policy.

An informal Resource Group on Governance and Capacity Building
was established in February 1997 to strengthen Bank policy and programming

on governance and capacity-building issues, and help

 

 

build the Bank's capacity with regard to stafling,
organization, and work processes, Since its establishment, the Group has made progress in helping to
increase the emphasis on governance and capacitybuilding concerns in Bank operations. A Learning
Group was formed to disseminate good practice to
interested staff on various governance and capacitybuilding topics.

With respect to capacity building, a qualitative
review of loans approved in the period 1995-1997
indicates that almost every loan project approved
included some element of capacity building. In most
cases, this concerned a focus on human resource

development. Although still relatively few, proje

addre:
cation of organizational structures and work processes,
and institutional development have increased in 1997, Examples of loans
approved in 1997 which include all three elements of capacity building
are the Urban Primary Health Care Project in Bangladesh (see box on page
55) and the Participatory Development of Agricultural Technology Project
in Indonesia. Relevant technical assistance projects included Capacity
Building of the Ministry of Health for Strategic Development in Indonesia, Capacity Building for Pension Reform in Kazakstan, and Instirational
Strengthening of the Department of Social Welfare and Development in
the Philippines.

Concerning governance, a qualitative review shows that its role in
Bank loans and technical assistance has increased significantly. The grow
S:

  

ing organizational development, the modifi
ing importance attached to governance is well illustrated by loans approved
in 1997 such as the Corporate Governance and Enterprise Reform Program
in the Kyrgyz Republic and the Public Sector Reform Program Loan forthe Federated States of Micronesia. Examples of technical assistance
projects with a strong governance character are Support for the Government
of Madhya Pradesh Public Finance Reform and Institutional Strengthening
in India, Capacity Building of the Ministry of Law and Justice in Nepal,
and Strengthening Information Disclosure and Compliance in Thailand.

A number of seminars and workshops were carried our in 1997 to
raise DMCs’ awareness of the importance of governance and capacity
building, An example of these was the seminar on Promoting Governance:
Sound Development Management, which was conducted in connection
with the 30° Annual Meeting of the Bank in Fukuoka, Japan. Other
examples included workshops on municipal management in Pakistan and
workshops on local government in the Philippines.

On a different level, follow-up was given to another key element of
the governance policy: participation through, among others, the RETA
on Facilitating Capacity Building and Participation Activities, approved
in late 1996, Fourteen requests amounting to $245,000 have been funded.
The proposals approved have supported a diversity of participatory practices across countries and sectors. Relatively small amounts of money have
served as a catalyst for locally responsive and innovative activities in a
number of Bank projects and country programming exercises. Initial feedback has indicated a substantial quality impact. Efforts are now under way
to document lessons learned with the objective to mainstream these into
the Bank's operations.

In another related area, in coordination with the World Bank and
the United Nations Development Programme, the Bank provided $245,000
to the International Federation of Accountants for developing and issuing
a series of accounting guidelines and standards to enhance financial reporting, accounting, and auditing in the public sector of its DMCs. This
is in line with the MTSF which emphasizes the Bank's role in catalyzing
development assistance that links project financing with policy review,
capacity building, good governance, and support for regional cooperation,

Law and development

Guided by the Bank’s five strategic objectives identified in the MTSF, the
Bank's law and development activities in 1997 promoted legal reforms to
create policy, legal, and regulatory frameworks supportive of economic
growth, poverty reduction, development of human resources, enhancement
of the status of women, and protection of the environment, Given the important role of the private sector in furthering economic growth, thé Bank's
law and development activities have focused particularly on the development
of legal and regulatory frameworks that support private sector development.
These law and development activities are being carried our through loan
conditions and covenants in project, sector, and especially program loans, as
well as through technical assistance providing consulting services for
development of policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional issues.

In 1997, the Bank approved eight law-related regional technical
assistance projects, 54 law-related technical assistance projects in 20 DMCs,
as well as three technical assistance loan projects. Such technical assistance

included capacity building for legal education and training, economic law
reform, support for private sector and other sectoral operations, enhanced
access to legal information, research on the relationship between law and
economic development in the Asian and Pacific region, and judicial
reform. The three technical assistance loan projects involved a loan to the
Republic of Korea, including legal and regulatory reforms in the domestic
financial markets and capital markets as part of the international financial
community's response to the Asian currency crisis; a loan to the Kyrgyz
Republic for capacity building for corporate governance, insolvency procedures, and telated strengthening of Arbitrazh Courts; and a loan to Pakistan
for regulatory reforms in the securities market.

Continuing legal education and training of public sector lawyers,
including members of the judiciary, constitute a primary focus of the
Bank's law and development programming. In 1997, the Bank approved
a technical assistance project for retraining of government legal officers
in Viet Nam. Under this project, assistance will be provided to the
Government to enhance its institutional capabilities for providing continuing legal education to Vietnamese lawyers operating in a merket
economy. The project will assist in the development and delivery of a
long-term countrywide legal retraining program, including a significant
faculty development component. A similar technical assistance project in
Mongolia will establish a retraining program in Ulaanbaatar to provide
continuing legal education for government lawyers, judges, prosecutors,
and other legal professionals for work in Mongolia’s evolving market
economy. A technical assistance project in the Maldives will strengthen
the legal system by identifying measures to improve court administration,
lawmaking, and legal education, including steps to be taken to establish
a program for continuing legal education of judges, court administrators,
government and private lawyers, and civil servants dealing with lawrelated issues. In Nepal, Bank assistance is being provided for the continuing
legal education of lawyers in the Ministry of Law and Justice to enhance
their capacity to advise the Government on international financial and
investment transactions.

Another element of the Bank's law and development programming
is economic law reform. To support Pakistan's capital market reforms, a
capital market and insurance law reform technical assistance project will
assist in developing legal frameworks for an independent and autonomous
securities regulatory body and an insurance regulatory body. A particular
feature of the Bank's 1997 activities in economic law reform was the
creation of efficient legal frameworks for secured transactions in its DMCs.
For this purpose, a technical assistance project in Viet Nam will assist in
the creation of a registration system for secured transactions, including
assistance in designing a centralized and publicly accessible computerized
system to register property, security, and other interests in property. The
Bank also approved a RETA to study and recommend, through a participatory process, improvements to existing systems for secured transactions
in PRC, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Thailand.

In the PRC, technical assistance to restructure insolvent state enterprises will assist the Government to train officials, judges, and administrators
responsible for reorganization or liquidation of insolvent stare-owned entities.

  

62A RETA grant was also approved to provide in-country training workshops
in PRC, India, and Indonesia for government lawyers who provide legal advice
on private development of infrastructure through BOT and build-ownoperate (BOO) transactions.

To support the Bank's private sector operations, law-related technical assistance projects, approved in 1997, included provision of training
for public sector sponsors in negotiating a joint venture to build and
operate a liquefied natural gas terminal in India, a regional study on
development of best practices to promote private sector investment in
infrastructure, and a regional study on governance and regulatory regimes
for private sector infrastructure development.

Other law-related technical assistance projects approved by the Bank
in 1997, strengthened legal aspects of the Bank's sectoral work in several
areas, including projects for (i) insurance industry and pension and provident
fund reforms in Bangladesh; (ii) strengthening the legal and regulatory
framework for water users associations in Bhutan; (iii) strenythening the
institutional and legal framework for the energy and mineral sectors in Cambodia;
(iv) developing a legal framework for the electricity sector in Madhya Pradesh,
India; (v) supporting urban waste management policies and strategies in
Indonesia; (vi) capacity building for pension reform in Kazakstan; (vii) a
corporatization plan for the Public Utilities Board in Kiribati; (viii) foreign
investment capacity enhancement in the Lao PDR; (ix) fisheries management
and development in the Federated States of Micronesia; (x) institutional
strengthening of Nepal's Ministry of Population and Environment; (xi) fisheries management and industry support in Papua New Guinea; (xii) Pasig
River environmental management and rehabilitation in the Philippines;
(xiii) implementation of a privatization strategy in Samoa; (xiv) institutional strengthening for comprehensive water resource management in
Sri Lanka; and (xv) strengthening of institutions engaged in environmental protection in Uzbekistan.

Inadequate access to legal information is a major constraint to economic activity in many of the Bank's DMCs. Creating a transparent and
easily accessible legal information system is, therefore, an important element of the Bank's law and development programming. Under a Bank
technical assistance project, a study has been carried out on ways of
improving the dissemination of information concerning PRC laws and
regulations. Based on this study, proposals have been formulated to create
and disseminate authorized translations of the PRC's principal economic
laws and regulations through a loose-leaf publication service and an electronic database.

In September 1997, the Bank held a symposium to consider a seminal
study completed under a previously approved RETA on the relationship
between legal change and economic development in PRC; India; Japan;
Republic of Korea; Malaysia; and Taipei,China from 1960 to 1995. The
study, conducted by interdisciplinary teams of lawyers and economists,
found marked parallels in the patterns of legal system change in the
countries under study over the 35-year period of rapid economic growth.
The study demonstrated that during this period, law was important to
private sector development and, in particular, to the development of
financial and capital markets, and pointed to the increased use of courtsANNUAL REPORT 1997

 

 

and administrative tribunals as economic activities increased. The study's
results also reflect the importance of viewing law reform as a process: the
legal tradition from which particular laws were drawn was of less importance than the consultative process by which law reform takes place. The
broader the consultative process, the greater the likelihood of congruence
between economic policy and legal reform, and with it the greater likelihood that governments allocate adequate resources for administration
and enforcement. The study, The Role of Law and Legal Institutions in
Asian Economic Development, 1960-1995, is scheduled for publication in
1998 and for further consideration ata number of national and international
seminars.

Judicial reform is another element of the Bank’s law and development
efforts. One of the Bank's RETA projects financed a Roundtable Meeting
of Chief Justices and Ministers of Justice of the Asian and Pacific region,
which was held at the Bank's Headquarters in August 1997 to consider
emerging trends in legal and judicial reform in the region. The Roundtable
Meeting provided an opportunity for Bank staff to assess emerging trends
in legal and judicial reforms in the region and to obtain the participants’
guidance on the future direction of the Bank's law and development
programming.

Cooperation with nongovernment organizations

Cooperation with nongovernment organizations (NGOs) is an expanding
and an increasingly important element in the Bank's operations. Cooperation
with NGOs involves establishing and further developing relationships
with NGOs in project activities as well as country-specific operations and
policy development. In its operations, the Bank seeks to cooperate with
competent and capable NGOs that have substantial knowledge of their
fields of focus and with which cooperation would be appropriate and
mutually beneficial. Where desirable and appropriate, the Bank works to |
promote dialogue between governments and NGOs and to support
government-NGO cooperation in national development efforts.

The objective of cooperation with NGOs is to strengthen the
effectiveness, sustainability, and quality of development initiatives
and interventions offered to DMCs. Over the past decade, sectors in
which the Bank and NGOs have realized the greatest cooperation
include agriculture and rural development, social infrastructure, urban |
development, water supply and sanitation, health and population,
education and training, microcredit and small-scale enterprise
development, and environmental protection and management. In project
activities, roles for NGOs are emerging at each level, from project
identification and design, to project implementation, to project monitoring and evaluation.

For 1997, a toral of 27, or 36 percent, of all projects approved
involved NGOs significantly, NGO roles in these projects ranged from
consultation in project design, to implementation of individual project
components, to complete responsibility for project implementation. Sectors where NGO involvement was most significant during the year werein agriculture and natural resources, and social infrastructure. Countries
in which cooperation with NGOs was most significant include Bangladesh,
Indonesia, Pakistan, and Viet Nam.

In addition to their involvement in project activities, there is increasing NGO involvement in country-level programming activities. In 1997,
NGOs contributed to country-level work in a number of countries. During
the year, work started within the Bank on a project addressing the broadening of participation in country programming activities, with NGOs
being a specific focus for expanded participation.

Specific processes for consultation with NGOs in policy development
were identified. NGO review and comment were part of several operational policies under development during 1997, including those for fisheries, Water resources, gender and development, and indigenous peoples.
During 1997, work on developing a new policy addressing the Bank's
cooperation with NGOs was completed, with NGOs contributing to the
formulation and shaping of this policy,

Work was completed in 1997 on a RETA project entitled “NGOs in
Development in Selected Asian Developing Member Countries.” The countries covered were Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Nepal, Pakistan,
Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vier Nam. This project sought to survey NGO
communities in the nine DMCs, and to identify the scope of the NGO sector
and its contributions to national development efforts. The project included
a regional workshop involving NGOs, government representatives, other
donors, and the Bank that worked to develop recommendations as to how
NGOs, governments, the Bank, and other donors can work together more
effectively and sustainably,

Private sector activities

The Bank provides direct financial assistance to selected private sector
projects. The main focus of assistance is currently on projects for financial
intermediation, capital market development, and infrastructure provision,
with projects in the industry and other sectors being considered only if
justified by strong socioeconomic merits. Through loans without government guarantees and equity investments, the Bank's participation in private
sector projects is seen as a source of comfort for other lenders and investors in these projects.

In 1997, the Bank approved six private sector operations involving
a total commitment of $119.3 million, comprising $45 million of unguaranteed
loans and $74.3 million of equity investments. For details, see Table 18 m the
Statistical Amex. Direct assistance by the Bank for these projects is expected
to facilitate investments and investible funds totaling $1.14 billion, an amount
which is about ten times the Bank's own funding commitment.

The 1997 approvals fell short of the levels achieved in 1996, during
which ten projects committing $263.3 million were approved by the Bank.
The slowdown of approvals in 1997 was due partly to delays in the processing
of three complicated pioneering BOO/BOT projects in the telecommunications and power sectors, and partly to the suspension of a toll road project
in one of the DMCs adversely affected by the Asian currency turmoil.

the momentum of economic development.

66

Of six operations approved in 1997, three are in the financial sector,
three in funds operations, and one in the industry sector. In the financial
sector, an equity investment in the Bhutan National Bank (BNB) is
intended to boost public confidence in BNB and attract increased
private sector participation in its equity capital. Another equity investment, in the newly established Infrastructure Development Finance
Company (IDFC) in India, will provide an opportunity to leverage the
Bank’s limited resources for financing private sector infrastructure
projects in the country, If successful, IDFC could be a model for other
DMCs looking for an institutional arrangement to stimulate infrastructure sector reform, private participation in infrastructure finance,
and domestic debt market development. An unguaranteed loan to the
National Development Bank of Sti Lanka (NDBSL) is combined with
a syndicated loan to give NDBSL funding access to international
banks and provide resources for onlending to small- and medium-sized
enterprises in Sri Lanka. The syndicated loan is to be covered by a partial
credit guarantee provided by the Bank against a counter-guarantee from
the Government of Sri Lanka.

The Kula Fund is one of the three funds projects approved in 1997,
It is the first venture capiral fund in the Pacific and is aimed at developing
the private sector in the small DMCs in the region. Due ro limited sound
investment opportunities in the Pacific DMCs, assistance from the Kula
Fund will target private enterprises in a wide range of sectors, including
agribusiness and food processing, tourism, fishing and marine resources,
transportation, forestry, minerals, light manufacturing, and financial services. The Fund's demonstration effect is expected to be an important
factor in inducing further inflows of capital to the Pacific region, The
Bank's investments in another fund operation, viz., Capital Asia
Infrastructure/Investment Limited, represents a vital effort to attract
significant amounts of long-term capital from major pension funds in
Canada and other members, including the newly industrialized economies, for investment in the DMCs.

The only industry sector project approved in 1997, Lafarge Surma
Cement Ltd., isa joint venture between the second largest cement producer
in the world based in France and one of the largest business groups in
Bangladesh. The project will establish in Bangladesh the largest and most
modern cement plant with an annual production capacity of 1.2 million
tons of gray portland cement thereby saving the country substantial foreign exchange through efficient import substitution.

Private sector investment portfolio: Starting with small stand-alone
equity investments in 1983, followed by loans without government guarantee two years later, the Bank's private sector operations have built up
a portfolio which totaled $1,017 million as of 31 December 1997. The
total portfolio consisted of $610 million in outstanding investments and
$407 million in undisbursed commitments. About 58 percent of the toral
portfolio was in loans amounting to $593 million and $424 million in
equity investments.

Twenty-eight percent of the total portfolio was accounted for by
loans and equity investments in infrastructure projects, which are beingOperational Priorities

 

given priority by the Bank's private sector operations in line with the
DMCs’ efforts to open the infrastructure sector to private investment.
Another 29 percent of the portfolio consisted of equity investments in
pioneering private financial institutions, including those that help promote capital market development (¢.g., securities firms and rating agencies), and loans to selected private finance companies and banks for
onlending to small and medium enterprises (see Portfolio Distribution by
Sector, 1997 table, at right).

The portfolio also included, to the extent of 19 percent, equity stakes
in investment funds and fund management companies, which enable
the Bank to leverage its own resources for supporting private investment. These funds comprised venture capital funds, mutual funds,
private equity funds, and lately, larger funds that provide equity and/
or debt financing to infrastructure projects. The balance of the portfolio (24 percent) consisted of loans and equity investments in manufacturing, agriculture, and other industries, Bank support for these
sectors started in the mid-1980s when several DMC governments began
to encourage the private sector to undertake large industrial ventures,
particularly with foreign technology and investment.

At the end of 1997, the total portfolio included loans and equity
investments in 104 companies, comprising 88 country-specific companies
in 13 DMCs, and 16 regional financial entities and funds. Seven companies were added to the portfolio and five were removed as a result of loan
cancellation, loan repayment, and equity divestment. Of the 104 companies comprising the portfolio, 46 were operating profitably, 27 were in
various stages of implementation, and 31 were underperforming.

Disbursements in 1997 amounted to $112 million, an increase of
58 percent from $71 million during 1996. At the end of 1997, disbursements to 28 companies had yet to be completed.

Interest and other income earned on the private sector portfolio in
1997 toraled $29 million, compared with $32 million in 1996, Dividends
received amounted to $5.9 million (2.7 percent yield), compared with the
previous year's $6.9 million (3.1 percent yield). Capital gains made on
equity divestments during the year amounted to $3.3 million, compared
with $5.9 million in 1996.

Allowance for possible losses on impaired loans and equity investments
in 1997 totaled $89.6 million, representing 14.7 percent of outstanding loans
and equity investments. This allowance included specific loss provisions
amounting to $56.4 million on impaired loans and equity investments,
and general loss provisions of $33.2 million on the balance of outstanding
loans and equity investments not specifically provided for,

Bank’s role in resource transfer

The net transfer of resources! from the Bank to the DMCs increased from
334 million in 1996 to $3,753.9 million in 1997. This sharp increase was

caused mainly by the large disbursement for the Financial Sector Progran
Joan to the Republic of Korea. However, even if this amount is excluded,
the total net transfer during 1997 would still be considerably higher thap
in 1996 due to Indonesia's much higher level of prepayment in 1996,
compared with 1997 and a $300 million disbursement for the Financial
Markets Reform Program loan to Thailand in 1997. For details, see Tables
39-41 in the Statistical Annex.

Of the total net transfer, a positive $2,869.3 million was from OCR
($869.3 million if the disbursement to the Republic of Korea is excluded)
and $884.6 million was from ADF.

Loan disbursements reached $6,457.8 million, compared with
$3,796.7 million in 1996. Excluding the Financial Sector Program loan to
the Republic of Korea, loan disbursements exceeded the year’s target b
13 percent and the 1996 disbursements by 17 percent. Disbursements from
OCR increased by 107 percent (29 percent if the program loan to the Republié
of Korea is excluded). Disbursements from ADF declined by 6 percent
compared with 1996. For details, see Table 22 in the Statistical Annex,

The disbursement ratio,* including program loans, increased to 25.2 per
cent (20.5 percent excluding the Financial Sector Program loan to the
Republic of Korea) from 17.7 percent in 1996. If all program loans a
excluded, the 1997 ratio of 18.6 percent still compared favorably with the
ratio of 17.4 percent in 1996.

By volume of net flow, Republic of Korea, Thailand, PRC, and India
were the top four beneficiaries of net transfers from the Bank.

Cofinancing and guarantee operations

During 1997, cofinancing played an increasingly important role in resource
mobilization. The Bank continued to act as a leading catalyst of private
financing for the Asian and Pacific region, especially infrastructure development. Further, given the significant macroeconomic impacts of the
prevailing regional currency crisis, the Bank took initiatives to help stahilize the economies of the DMCs which are suffering from the currency
crisis and restore investor confidence through direct lending and cofinancing
operations in Thailand. The Bank has progressively stressed its cofinancing
strategy and modalities, and increasingly integrated cofinancing operations into the process of country strategy formulation, programming, and
project preparation,

In 1997, cofinancing mobilized from all sources amounted to
$2,702.5 million. This represented a slight increase of 2 percent over the
$2,662.5 million achieved in 1996, and was equivalent to 29 percent of the
Bank's total lending of $9,414 million committed during the year, Thirty-nine
Bank-assisted projects obtained cofinancing in 1997 compared with 29 projects
in the previous year, an increase of 34 percent. The finance, transport and
communications, and energy sectors accounted for 59, 14, and 12 percent,

 

2 Defined as the ratio of disbursement during the yeur over the undisbursed net loan
balance at the beginning of the year plus effective loans approved during the year:
excludes private sector loans,respectively, of the cofinancing volume for 1997. In terms of number of
projects that received cofinancing, the social sector had nine, while the
agriculture and natural resources and the transport and communications
sectors had eight each. Cofinancing came from official, export credit, and
commercial sources. For details, see Table 17 im the Statistical Annex.

A total of 14 DMCs received cofinancing in 1997 with Thailand as the
top recipient for $1,000 million, followed by People's Republic of China
with $438 million, India with $368 million, and Pakistan with $320 million.

During the period 1970-1997, the cumulative total cofinancing
amounted to $27.2 billion. Of this total, the energy sector had the largest
share, amounting to $12.8 billion or 47 percent; followed by transport and
communications, $4.3 billion or 16 percent; agriculture and natural resources, $3.6 billion or 13 percent. The balance of $6.5 billion or 24 percent was to other sectors. Large infrastructure projects have generally
attracted substantial cofinancing more often than other projects.

Official cofinancing

Cofinancing from bilateral donors and multilateral agencies increased in
number of projects but declined in overall amount, from $2,365 million
in 1996 to $1,103.6 million in 1997, and accounted for 41 percent of total
cofinancing mobilized in 1997. This reduction in official cofinancing reflected
achange in the composition of public sector projects requiring cofinancing,
which shifted from large infrastructure projects to small- and mediumsized social sector projects. The share of bilateral sources amounted to
82 percent or $908 million, while the share of multilateral sources amounted
to 18 percent or $196 million, Bilateral cofinancing support was received
from L1 countries: Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan,
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom. Japan continued to be the largest source of official cofinancing. It cofinanced seven
projects for a total of $727 million, of which $630 million came from the
Export-Import Bank of Japan and $97 million from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund. Spain, for the first time, contributed $15.4 million for three projects in Bangladesh, Mongolia, and Philippines. Multilateral
agencies, including the European Investment Bank and OPEC Fund, have
provided parallel and joint cofinancing support.

The Bank actively pursued cofinancing for technical assistance with
official donors. This included voluntary contributions to the Bank's Technical
Assistance Special Fund (TASF), annual contributions to the Japan Special
Fund (JSF), and untied grants from bilateral sources. The mode of
cofinancing used was normally exclusive or joint-financing arrangements.
Donors from bilateral sources included the governments of Australia,
Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland.
During 1997, untied grants from bilateral sources, where the Bank acted
as the grant administrator, amounted to $15.4 million inclusive of grant
assistance from Australia, Belgium, and Netherlands, to finance soft
components included in Bank-assiseed loans.

Under the existing JSF program financed by the Government of
Japan, a total of $90.3 million for 139 technical assistance projects, including
RETA, was financed in 1997, accounting for 55 percent of total technical

Cofinancing Arrangements

assistance approvals. For details, see Japan Special Fund Technical Assistance by Sector, 1997 on page 170.

During 1997, the Government of Belgium made available to the Bank
an additional contribution in Belgian franes (BF)20 million ($500,000
equivalent) to finance, on an untied basis, technical assistance projects
under the Channel Financing arrangement administered by the Bank. In
addition, the Bank also assisted some DMCs in obtaining grant financing
on a parallel basis as complementary to Bank loans.

Commercial cofinancing

Asa result of continued Bankwide efforts to seek commercial funding,
cofinancing from market sources increased significantly to $1,591.9 million) in 1997 from $232.8 million in 1996. The year saw the share of
commercial cofinancing in the total cofinancing exceeding that of official
cofinancing, and it is expected that the relative share of commercial
cofinancing will continue to increase in the future. During the year, eight
transactions were completed, including seven loans arranged for public
sector borrowers and one loan arranged for a private sector borrower.
Nearly all commercial cofinancing in 1997 was on a parallel basis, except
for a $50 million ten-year syndicated loan facility for the National
Development Bank of Sri Lanka using the partial credit guarantee. In this
transaction, the Bank guaranteed the principal amount at the final maturity
and the Government of Sri Lanka guaranteed the interest payments. One
large market cofinancing was successfully arranged, but approval of the
project slipped to 1998. Given the uncertain market conditions, the Bank
can expect an increase in the use of credit enhancement in future commercial cofinancing transactions,

Export credit cofinancing

During the year, export credit cofinancing of $7 million was contributed
by the Export Development Corporation of Canada for a railway project
in Bangladesh,

Administration: A total of 500 projects were under administration as of
end-1997. These included 445 projects in the public sector and 55 projects
in the private sector. Of the public sector projects, 420 were performing
satisfactorily (by conforming to target dates and project costs, and by
complying with loan covenants established during appraisal), 24 faced
implementation or operational problems, and one was considered inactive.

Altogether, 749 project administration missions, including private
sector loan missions and multiproject missions, were fielded to review the
progress of projects and to discuss problems, ifany, with executing agencies.

 

Includes $1,000 million parallel commercial cofinancing for Thailand.Operational Priorities

These missions spent a total of 7,869 persondays, or an average of
12.1 persondays per project, which was higher than last year's average of
11.8 persondays per project. Implementation support was provided to
executing agencies by the Bank’s regional and resident missions. Portfolio
performance reviews were carried out to improve disbursements by
restructuring or reformulating slow-moving projects and identifying loan
proceeds for cancellation,

Country project review missions (CPRMs) were undertaken in 14 DMCs
in 1997 to discuss implementation problems, cross-sectoral issues, and
remedial measures with senior government officials. The format and content
of the CPRM paper were further revised to make the CPRMs more
effective and results oriented.

The implementation of 76 projects was completed during the year,
bringing the cumulative number of completed projects to 1,127. Project
completion reports were circulated for 49 projects, bringing the total
number of reports prepared as of end-1997 to 768. For details, see Table
23 in the Statistical Annex.

As in earlier years, project administration procedures continued to
be revised in light of the Bank's strategic plan. Computer systems
continued to be developed for better monitoring and evaluation of
benefits, Ten seminars and workshops were held to enhance the implementation capabilities of executing agencies, the activities of which
benefited a total of 332 senior and middle-level officials. In addition,
23 in-house seminars were held for Bank staff dealing with project processing and administration.

Contract awards: During 1997, contracts totaling $5,948.5 million Crciract/Aseaida and Distsivensnentis
(excluding contracts for technical assistance projects) were awarded by 1993-1997

executing agencies in DMCs for consulting services and procurement of a

goods and related services and civil works. This represented a 49 percent
increase from 1996, which was entirely attributed to contracts awarded
under a sector development program loan to the Republic of Korea.
Consultancy contracts under loan projects totaled $192.3 million. These
involved 217 consulting contracts (107 international and 110 domestic).
For details, see Tables 24 and 25 in the Statistical Annex.

For technical assistance projects, 553 contracts were awarded for
consultancy services, amounting to $139.9 million, involving 169 consulting firms and 384 individual consultants. For details, see Tables 32 and 33
in the Statistical Annex.

Loan disbursements: The 1997 loan disbursements, a new disbursement record, accelerated to $6,457.8 million, exceeding the year's target
of $3,955.5 million by 63.3 percent and 1996 figures by 70.1 percent. Of
the 1997 total, OCR disbursements amounted to $5,303.7 million and
ADF disbursements to $1,154.1 million, representing 82.1 percent and
17.9 percent of the total amount, respectively. The significant increase
resulted from disbursements of program loans to the Republic of Korea
of $2,000 million and Thailand of $300 million. Without these program
loan disbursements, the 1997 projection was still exceeded by 5.1 percent,

Performance evaluation and development impact

The Bank recognizes that development encompasses more than economic
growth. Development has become multidimensional, and development
programs must provide benefits in terms of promoting equitable growth,
human resource enhancement, policy improvement, environmental sustainability, and institutional strengthening. Concerns about the effectiveness of
development assistance programs have created a growing demand for performance evaluation and indicators that can give an objective basis for assessing
development impact. There is also pressure for more immediate feedback
of performance evaluation results and dissemination of best practices.

The Bank took several initiatives in 1997 toward improving performance evaluation and the quality of Bank assistance to DMCs. A Project
Performance Management System (PPMS) was formulated to serve as
management tool for planning, managing, monitoring, and evaluating progress
and impacts during the entire project cycle. The keys to the success of PPMS
are (i) identification of indicators to monitor the achievement of expected
impacts; and (ii) continuing efforts to observe progress of the indicators.
The PPMS is currently being tested in a number of projects.

Within the framework of PPMS, another initiative in 1997 was to
improve the administration and supervision of ongoing projects by introducing the Project Performance Report (PPR). The existing approach to
reporting on project administration did not capture the accomplishmentOperational Priorities

Realizing that good evaluation should meet participants’ needs, Generally

(PEIS) more user-friendly and widely available.

 

 

 

Project Performance Report System

E BANK’s current system of supervision and administration of ongoing
projects bas placed great emphasis on the physical and financial aspects
of project progress. For instance, the ratings of ongoing projects in the Project
Administration Committee (PAC) Notes are based on project progress in
terms of (i) meeting the implementation schedule, (ii) adhering to the original project cost structure, and (iii) compliance with loan covenants. Based on
experience, the ratio of successful ongoing projects has been found to be
substantially higher than that of projects independently postevaluated after
completion, In 1997, the Bank examined this issue and proposed an alternative classification system thar will (i) bring project ratings of self-evaluation
and independent evaluation closer, and (ii) allow monitoring of development
objectives at an earlier stage of project implementation.

To this end, and with view to harmonizing the Bank's own project
administration system with other multilateral development banks, an Interdepartmental Working Group on Project Classification System was set up in
February 1997 in coordination with staff formulating the PPMS to review the
Bank's current project administration and project classification system. The
Group recommended the replacement of the current PAC Notes with the
Project Pertormance Report (PPR). Like PAC Notes, the PPR provides information on physical and financial progress; hur, it also highlights the progress
on achieving development objectives: In addition, the PPR provides timely
information on potential risks and key assumptions influencing project results, offers timely cemediil actions for problems encountered during implementation, and gives project ratings nor only in terms of implementation
progress but also in accomplishment of development objectives.

The PPR has been implemented on an experimental basis since October
1997 in selected projects from all the Projects Departments for a trial period
of 9 to 12 months.

Economie and Social Benefits
of Selected Projects

NUMBER of projects evaluated in 1997

vere found to have provided tangible eco
nomic and social benefits to the DMCs con
cemed. They also addressed crosscutting issues,

such as poverty reduction, gender and development, and environmental protection.

For example, some plantations successfully
established under the Forestry Development
Project in the Philippines have contributed to
positive environmental benefits in terms ofreduced
soil emsion, improved water yields, and increased
biodiversity. The forest road network constructed
under the Project also provided better access to
extension, trade, health, and other social services for the local residents.

In Bangladesh, the Ganges-Kobadak Rehabilitation Project resulted in major improvements in water management, thus reducing by
half the cost of pumping. The project included
activities supportive of the environment such
as integrated pest management, pond fisheries,
and tree production along the canals. Many
wonten were employed under the Food-for-Work
Program activities of the project.

The gravity schemes in the hills constricted
under the Rural Water Supply Sector Project in
Nepal have reduced the time and drudgery of
collecting water, especially for women. In addition, the quality of water has improved; consumption of water has increased; hygiene
phictices have improved with more frequent
bathing and laundry; and disease incidence in
the area has been reduced.

In Indonesia, the Health and Population
Project resulted in the construction of infrastracture facilities for training paramedical staff.
Through the project, family planning methods
were made more readily available in four provinces.

The Sigatoka Valley Rural Development
Project in Fiji had a sustainable impact on most
households in the project area, particularly on
the users of irrigation facilities. The Project
provided low-lift pumps, improved road access,
arid more intensive extension activity. The beneficiaries of low-lift pumps reported substantial
improvements in their income and living

standards,

Continuing its ongoing commitment to the MTSF and in line with
the Report of the Development Committee Task Foree on Multilateral
Development Banks in 1996, the Post-Evaluation Office undertook various activities during the year aimed at enhancing the Bank's development
effectiveness. These include increased focus on the preparation of impact
evaluation, reevaluation, and special evaluation studies, while reducing the
coverage of Project Performance Audit Reports (PPARs) to a minimum
required 30 percent. These activities help assess the long-run development
effectiveness of a wide range of operations, bringing out implications for
policies and programs. In addition, PEO processed a number of technical
assistance projects to help DMCs develop their own performance evaluation
capability. In total, PEO prepared 51 evaluation reports during the year.

Project performance audit reports

PPARs were prepared for 24 project and program loans selected at random
from a stratified sample. These PPARs covered various sectors including
agriculture and natural resources, transport and communications, social
infrastructure, energy, and financial. Cumulatively, by the end of the year,
500 PPARs had been prepared for 521 projects and programs covering all
major sectors and subsectors in 26 DMCs.*

Of the 24 projects and programs evaluated in 1997, 11 (46 percent)
were classified as generally successful, 8 (33 percent) as partly successful,
and 5 (21 percent) as unsuccessful. Such ratings are the result of a
combination of factors, particularly the country and sector/subsector mix
for which Project Completion Reports are available for postevaluation
during the year. Performance of projects varied among different sectors.
The projects in the energy and transport and communications sectors
continued to have traditionally high success rates, reflecting their
straightforward design based on known technology and limited social
complexities. Projects in the agriculture and social infrastructure sectors,
however, were adversely affected by more endogenous and exogenous
uncertainties and lack of supportive macroeconomic and sectoral policies,
and were more complicated and difficult to supervise. The capability of
institutions implementing them were relatively weak. Recognizing the
problems, the Bank continued to provide assistance to these sectors for
capacity building and economic and sector studies, among others, to
support policy and institutional reforms.

Total investment costs of the evaluated projects in 1997 came to
$1,889 million, compared with the original estimate of $1,970.2 million.
The factors responsible for cost underruns included savings from the
depreciation of the local currency against the dollar, interest during
construction, and unused contingency allocation; scaling down of original
project scope; and lower actual costs of equipment and supplies compared
with appraisal estimates. In rerms of actual investment costs, about 58 percent of the projects evaluated in 1997 were generally successful, 28 percent

 

4 The difference of 21 is explained by the face that 17 PPARs covered two projects each
and nwo covered three projects each,were partly successful, and 14 percent were unsuccessful. This indicates
that, on average, evaluated projects rated generally successful involved
large investment costs, as in the energy and transport and communications sectors Which also have traditionally achieved high success rates.

For most of the projects evaluated in 1997, the average implementation
delay was estimated at about two years.) Factors responsible for the delay
included shortage of local funds; cumbersome government procedures in
consultant appointments, procurement, and awards of construction contracts; and overly optimistic implementation schedules during appraisal.
The other factors cited included frequent redeployment of project equipment to other work, delays in loan effectiveness, unsatisfactory performance of contractors, inexperience and lack of authority of executing
agencies, land acquisition problems, and civil disturbances.

A number of projects evaluated during 1997 have contributed to the
social and economic development of the countries concerned (see box on
Economic and Social Benefits, page 74).

Overall, the experience of 1997 evaluated projects/programs highlights several lessons which are relevant to future Bank operations. Among
these are (i) the importance of an accurate analysis of a project's financial
implications (to ensure that counterpart funds and operating budgets are
available), and the risks of nonavailability of local funds (even when prior
assurance of government has been received); (ii) the need to establish a
performance monitoring system with clearly defined indicators and an
adequate feedback mechanism so that timely remedial actions can be
taken to realign project activities; (iii) the need for adoption of a pilot
approach accompanied by a strong research and development program for
large-scale project activities when technologies are tested in the local
setting; (iv) the importance of project supervision from resident and regional
missions (instead of from the Bank's Headquarters), which is often more
effective, resulting in better understanding of local problems and, when
needed, more timely reallocation of loan proceeds; (v) the need for the
Bank's agricultural credit operations through agricultural development
finance institutions (DFls) to be preceded by rigorous assessment of the
DF1’s institutional capacity and financial health; and (vi) the importance
of careful analysis of institutional capacity and executing agency
arrangements for integrated rural development projects where coordination among different government agencies is critical.

Technical assistance performance audit reports

With a view to capturing the impact and development effectiveness
of the Bank's technical assistance operations, PEO switched from
performance audit of individual technical assistance to evaluating a
cluster of technical assistance projects. Three such technical assistance
performance audit reports (TPARs) were prepared in 1997. They related
to two advisory technical assistance on institutional development and

projects in Bangladesh and the Philippines (six-year delay each),

eight technical assistance in the banking sector of Mongolia; and three
technical assistance projects in the environment sector in the People’s
Republic of China. All three TPARs indicated that the implementation
of most of the technical assistance in these countries was generally successful.

Impact evaluation and reevaluation studies

Impact evaluation studies review a number of projects and programs in
a given sector in an individual member country or group of countries,
several years alter completion, to assess what lasting contributions the
Bank has been able to make in the member countries’ development. PEO
carried out four such studies during the year: (i) health and population
sector in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, and Sri Lanka; (ii) urban
development and housing sector in Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, and
Thailand; (iii) road sector in the Philippines; and (iv) industrial crops and
agro-industry sectors in Indonesia. Similarly, five reevaluation studies,
which focus in greater depth on the impact and sustainability of a single
project four or five years after its audit, were also undertaken in 1997.°
See box on Selected Impact Evaluation and Reevaluation Studies, at right.

Special studies

Special studies involve intensive analysis of a particular issue of operational
importance in a specific country, sector, or in the region. PEO carried out
four such studies in 1997. The special study on Sri Lanka aimed to assess
the country’s macroeconomic conditions and policies at the time of project
implementation, evaluate the impact of such conditions and policies on
the projects, and establish lessons associated with policy changes. The
study revealed that the success of evaluated projects in Sri Lanka was
substantially affected by changes in economic policy and the economic
environment, with no systematic differences in vulnerability of projects
across sectors. Being a relatively open and small economy, the Sri Lankan
projects were most seriously affected by changes in world prices, foreign
trade policies, and real effective exchange rates. The civil conflict also
had a profound effect on the outcome of the Bank-assisted projects.
The special study on Issues Pertaining to the Engagement of Consultants
in Bank Loan Projects and Their Effect on Project Performance covered
six countries’ and it aimed at identifying factors contributing to delays
in consultants’ engagement in Bank projects, examining the implications
of such delays, and proposing measures for timely engagement. The study
found that the most common reasons for delays in consultants’ engagement
were, among others, (i) DMCs’ lack of familiarity with the Bank's guidelines

 

* These reevaluation studies included (i) the Fourth Industrial Development Bank of

Pakistan Project; (li) the Bali Errigation Sector Project in Indonesia; (iii) the Second
Senior Technical Schools Project also in Indonesia; (iv) the Vientiane Plain Rural
Electrification Project {Phases | and 1) in the Lao PDR; and (vy) the Rubber Rehabilitation
and Expansion Project in Bangladesh,

and procedures, and in some cases, nonadherence to them; (ii) highly
centralized, cumbersome, and nontransparent decision-making procedures

Selected Impact Evaluation and Reevaluation Studies

IMPACT evaluation study on the Bank's assistance in the health and
population sector had a positive impact as reflected by demographic and
health indicators, morbidity indicators, and beneficiary perceptions of the
tacilities and services provided under the projects. Bank assistance has also
contributed to increased family planning acceptance in these countries, establishment of health-related facilines, and the implementation of training
programs. In particular, the projects in Sri Lanka helped the Government
make policy changes to focus more on the delivery of health services through
peripheral health centers.

The study on Bank's assistance in the urban development and housing
sector showed that projects succeeded in improving living conditions, They
also helped facilitate industrialization, especially when the projects included
support for training, employment creation, and complementary infrastructure. Furthermore, findings of the study underpinned the importance of
involving local yowernments and beneficiaries.

The reevaluation of the Second Senior Technical Schools Project in
Indonesia, reconfirmed a PPAR’s conclusion thar the project was generally
successful, The project has continued to perform well, achieving its objectives
and targets set out at the time of appriisal. Through closer cooperation of
industry and aid agencies, the internal and external efficiency of technical
education has improved. The project has also assisted the Government in
achieving more balanced regional growth by providing equitable access to
quality technical education in six provinces where previously donor assistance had not been provided. The success of the quality upgrading of senior
technical high schools in Indonesia highlights the importance of providing
assistance und policy guidance over the long term in the education sector,

The reevaluation of the Fourth Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan
(IDBP) Project reclassified the project from partly successful to unsuccessful,
The review revealed poor and worsening subborrower project performance, a
high incidence of closures, and nonsustainability of institutional strengthening measures. The overall outcomes of subprojects were markedly less favorable than expected at appraisal and during completion and postevaluation.
The prevailing macroeconomic conditions in the country made debr servicing difficult and contributed to [DRBP’s worsening performance. With the
benefit of hindsight, the Bank's assistance could have focused on improving
the operational environment and regulatory framework of the banking and
financial sectors.

The Vientiane Plain Rural Electrification Project (Phases | and Il) was
rated partly successful ar reevaluation. The project's performance indicated
that the people living in the area benefited substantially from their access to
electricity, including increased learning opportunities and enhanced living
standards, However, the project is not financially viable because of insufficient sales revenues to recover electricity supply costs. The project experience highlighted the importance of providing infrastructural support such as
transport and communications, marketing, and credir to rural electrification
undertakings; and the need to resolve the level and structural problems ot
tarifts.

at various stages of selecting consultants; (iii) inadequate delegation of
authority to the executing agencies and in some cases reluctance to
exercise available authority; and (iv) lobbying and political interference.
On the Bank's side, one major factor contributing to the delays included
insufficient attention to the institutional strengths and weaknesses of the
executing agencies during project formulation. The study's recommendations
included, among others, the need for (i) the Bank to engage in a serious
policy dialogue with DMCs on the issues raised by the study, particularly
toward helping make the process of consultants’ engagement more transparent and with reduced scope for lobbying and political interference;
(ii) alerting DMCs of the Bank's readiness and seriousness in canceling
loans when satisfactory progress is not demonstrated; and (iii) forewarning DMCs that the Bank will audit consultants’ contracts when evidence
warrants.

Strengthening the performance evaluation capability of DMCs

To strengthen the member countries’ evaluation capability to carry out
evaluation work on their own and enhance their overall project performance management system, PEO processed four advisory technical assistance projects in 1997, Three of these were for helping develop/strengthen
project performance management systems in Nepal, Philippines, and
Sri Lanka. Assistance to the PRC was for strengthening the evaluation
capacity of four agencies: the China National Audit Office, the State
Planning Commission, the State Development Bank, and the China
International Engineering Consulting Corporation. Two technical assistance completion reports prepared in 1997 also concluded that the assistance provided was generally successful in strengthening the evaluation
capability of the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division in
Bangladesh, and the Central Monitoring and Evaluation Division of the
National Planning Commission Secretariat in Nepal.

Feedback of postevaluation findings

The computerized Postevaluation Information System (PEIS), which was
redesigned in 1995, was made accessible on-line to all Bank staff in
1997. Under the system, information on PCRs, PPARs, TCRs, TPARs,
impact evaluation studies, reevaluation studies, and other evaluation
reports was made available for use by staff from operations departments.

Annual performance evaluation program

The 1997 Annual Performance Evaluation Program (APEP) reviews the
1996 program of activities of the Bank's various departments and offices
as they relate to project performance and presents the program of activities planned for 1997. The APEP is part of the feedback process on the
entire project cycle, covering strategy formulation, country programming,
project preparation, project implementation, and evaluation. To maximize APEP’s effectiveness, the timing of the preparation of the 1997
APEP was adjusted to allow its completion prior to the preparation of the1998 budget. While many of the earlier recommendations to improve
feedback were being implemented, a more thorough assessment is expected to be made in the 1998 APEP.

Interagency cooperation

The Bank maintained close coordination with other multilateral and
bilateral donors on evaluation activities through the Expert Group on Aid
Evaluation of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the
Evaluation Cooperation Group (ECG) of the multilateral development
banks. The major accomplished tasks of the ECG, which the Bank chaired
in 1997, included (i) a study on harmonization of performance management and completion reporting, and (ii) stocktaking of the existing
framework and practices of assessing development effectiveness. Collaborative work has been initiated in the areas of joint evaluation, country
program evaluation, evaluation of capacity building in developing countries,
and evaluation of private sector projects.

79Regional Highlights

Global economy

HE FINANCIAL crisis that unfolded in Thailand in July 1997

has subsequently spread to the rest of Asia and to the rest of the

world. On balance, industrial countries continued to perform well
in 1997 — growth remained strong with the exception of Japan, external
imbalances were the lowest in decades, and price stability was better
than it has been for decades. The global economy remained strong
during 1997 with aggregate world output estimated to have risen by
3.2 percent. Solid growth and lowinflation in the United Kingdom (UK)
and the United States (US), aided by strong recovery in Canada, and
a gradual revival of economic activity in Western Europe, underpinned.
the strong performance in 1997. Although some countries experienced.
a setback associated with the recent crisis in financial markets in the
Asian newly industrialized economies (NIEs) and Southeast Asia, growth
was robust in most of the developing world, particularly in the People’s
Republic of China (PRC) and much of the rest of Asia. There was
evidence of an end to the decline in output in the Russian Federation.
and in the transitional economies as a group. Inflation remained lowin
most countries, reflecting a commitment to price stability. The steep fall
in oil prices anda moderate decline in non-oil commodity prices helped
keep the inflation rate in check. Lowinflation rates and stable exchange
ratesin the advanced economies resulted in relatively low world interest

rates. World export volume expanded by 7.8 percent after slowing down,
to 6.3 percent in 1996. This was mainly attributable to a recovery of trade
among the industrial countries. Import volume of the US increased rapidly
while export performances of France, Germany, and Japan showed marked
improvement.

The outlook for the global economy in 1998 will depend on a satisfactory
resolution of the financial crisis in Asia, particularly in the NIEs and
Southeast Asia. The impact of the crisis on the world economy will be
significant and will most adversely affect developing countries through a
substantial deterioration in their terms of trade. W orld economic growth
is expected to moderate to 2.6 percent in 1998 and world trade volume
will increase at a slower pace. Inflation and interest rates will remain low
with the gross domestic product (GDP) deflator for advanced economies
below3 percent.

There are downside risks in the medium term, including a risk that
the uncertainties about the economic and monetary union will continue
even as European interest rates converge. An inappropriate fiscal response to rising unemployment could shift market sentiment and bring
about interest rate and exchange rate turmoil.

Advanced economies

The Japanese economic recovery faltered in 1997 as the effects of the
substantial fiscal tightening implemented during the second quarter of
1997 constrained consumer spending. Spending on private capital and
housing also weakened. Aside from the depressant effects of higher taxes,

the sluggishness can be attributed to the deterioration in consumer and
business confidence arising from the scandals and bankruptcies in the
financial sector. This resulted in a growth of less than 1 percent in 1997,

compared with 3.8 percent in 1996. Japanese interest rates have remained.
low, reflecting the weak economic growth. The financial crisis in Asia has
also affected Japan more than any of the major developed economies as
exports to the most-affected countries declined and Japanese goods faced
greater competition. By the end of 1997, Japanese exports to Indonesia,
Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand had declined
steeply. In Australia, growth was driven bya recovery in domestic demand
in response to reductionsin interest rates while in New Zealand, imbalances
in economic policy continue to weaken the economy.

Some advanced economies recorded robust growth in 1997, while
others grew more slowly. The US economy continued its noninflationary
expansion, registering GDP growth of 3.8 percent in 1997, combining
solid growth of output and employment with lowinflation and a diminishing
fiscal balance. T his reflects prudent macroeconomic policies with an
exceptionally dynamic private sector anda responsive labor market. In
Canada, economic growth was spurred by increased business and household
spending, declining short- and long-term interest rates, and improved
external competitiveness. Growth in Wester Europe was primarily exportledalthough there wasevidence of improving domestic demand, particularly
in France and Spain. In Germany, investment spending continued to lag.
In Switzerland, economic activity expanded by 0.5 percent after six yearsRegional Highlights

 

of broad economic stagnation. Recent unemployment figures in France,
Germany, and Italy indicate relatively low levels of resource utilization,
in marked contrast with those for the UK and the US. Growth in the
European Union was 2.6 percent in 1997 with growth picking up in
France, Germany, and UK, while growth in Italy was subdued. With a few
exceptions, the small- and medium-sized advanced economies also enjoyed relatively solid economic growth with moderate inflation.

The high degree of price stability remains an impressive achievement,
shared by almost all the advanced economies. Significant inflation pressures
neither exist nor are foreseen. A problem, however, is the variable labor
market performance. Some economies have posted record high unemployment
rates. There hasbeen substantial effort in many of the economies to reduce
fiscal imbalances that had reached unsustainable levels in the past. Fiscal
tightening became a restraining force, both in terms of growth andemployment.
However, buoyant household spending, vigorous business investment and,
in some economies, strong export demand compensated sufficiently to
increase output.

Developing economies

Tensions in the financial markets of Southeast Asia in the second half
of 1997 spread to the rest of the developing world, resulting in a decline
in GDP growth to 5.9 percent in 1997 from 6.4 percent in 1996. While
growth in the Asian region moderated further in 1997, growth trends in
other regions were particularly encouraging. In most developing economies, lowor declining inflation and generally prudent fiscal policies suggest that threats to growth, arising from policy imbalances,
have been significantly reduced, although challenges in
governance remain. There are, however, a number of developing economies which are lagging in policy reforms and.
risk being marginalized in a fast-integrating world economy.

GDP growth in the range of 5.5 percent to 8 percent. The economic
performance of the developing economies in the Middle East and Europe
continued to register significant improvements despite a slight decline in
oil prices. Economic growth in Central and Eastern Europe (excluding the
Russian Federation) is estimated to have slowed down to 2 percent in
1997, compared with over 3 percent in 1996. The slowdown highlights
the enormous difficulties facing most of the transitional economies.

Developing Asia

Asia continued to be the fastest-growing region in the world although real
GDP growth declined further to 6.1 percent in 1997 from 7.5 percent in
1996. The decline in growth is mainly attributable to the financial crisis
which unfolded in Thailand in July 1997 and rapidly infected a number
of countries in Southeast Asia and the Republic of Korea. The pressures
have been acute in Thailand where fragilities in the banking sector
aggravated the situation, resulting in slightlynegative growth for the year.

Spillover from the crisis was also felt strongly in Indonesia, Malaysia, and
Philippines. Toward the end of 1997, the Republic of Korea followed suit.

Asa result of these developments in the region’s financial markets, eco
nomic growth among the NIEs declined slightly from 6.4 percent in 1996

to6 percent in 1997, while in Southeast Asia, growth declined substantially
from7.1 percent to3.8 percent. Inflation declined substantiallyto4.3 percent
from 6.7 percent in 1996 as conservative monetary and fiscal policies
continued to be enforced, and partly due to the economic slowdown in
the region.

The financial turmoil has not only deepened; it has also widened as
the spillover effects are being felt throughout the region and beyond. The
Southeast Asian currencies and the Korean won have depreciated sharply,
and have yet to show improvements on a trend basis. T his has brought
about downward pressures on the currencies perceived to be vulnerable,
not only in Asia but also all over the world. Many emerging and industrial
markets have also experienced sizable declines in their stock markets.

more skill- and capital-intensive product lines. Economic growth in the
NIEs weakened beginning in 1996, slipping further from 6.4 percent to
6 percent in 1997. Among the NIEs, only the Republic of Korea remained
in a downturn phase in 1997. Internal financial problems and external
liquidity shortages were aggravated by the regional financial crisis in the
latter part of 1997. This resulted in a call for the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) to broker an assistance package for the Republic of Korea
amounting to $57 billion, including Bank assistance of $4 billion. In the case
of Hong Kong, China, the impact of the regional financial crisis was felt

throughhigh interest rates which adversely affected the financial and property
markets in the fourth quarter of 1997. Singapore was affected less severely,
but still suffered currencyand stock market declines. Except for mild effects
onthe currencyandstock markets, Taipei,China remained virtually unscathed
bythe region’s financial crisis, aided by exceptionally high foreign reserves
relative to foreign liabilities. On the inflation front, the NIEs have been
successful in controlling consumer price increases, as inflation rates further
declined to 3.5 percent in 1997 from 4.3 percent in 1996.

Hong Kong, China
Economic performance

Economic growth: After a smooth handover to the PRC in July and
robust economic activity in the first nine months of 1997, Hong Kong,
China’s economy slowed down in the fourth quarter as the effects of the
regional currency crisis spread to the local financial markets. Domestic
demand remained vigorous in the first three quarters, underpinned by the
continued strength of both consumer and investment spending, The impact
of the regional crisis on the economy has been felt through high interest
rates adversely affecting the financial and property markets. The Hong
Kong dollar, which has been linked to the US dollar since 1983, came
under pressure in October 1997. The Government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) had allowed a prompt tightening of domestic monetary conditions caused by the automatic adjustment
mechanism of the currency board system to counter the pressure in the
foreign exchange market. By the end of 1997, the benchmark HangSeng
Index declined by about 33 percent belowits August peak and property
prices had dropped by 14 percent since October 1997. Despite the fourth
quarter slowdown, GDP grewby5.2 percent in 1997.

Inflation: Inflation in 1997, as measured by the consumer price index
(CPI), was moderate at 5.7 percent. Upward pressure on inflation from
the tightening labor market and rising property prices in the first three
quarters of 1997 was countered by the decline in asset prices and the
economic slowdown in the last quarter of the year. Imported inflation also
remained subdued, amid low inflation in the major supplier economies,
continued strength of the US dollar, and generally soft world commodity
prices.

External sector: Export growth was restrained by the modest import
demand in some of the major markets (PRC, Japan, Republic of Korea,
and Singapore) and the continued strength of the US dollar and consequently the Hong Kong dollar. The substantial currency depreciation in
anumber of Asian economies since the middle of 1997 didnot noticeably
affect Hong Kong, Chinas exports performance. Inbound tourism, however,
weakened considerably. For 1997, total merchandise exports grewby4 percent
and merchandise imports rose by5.1 percent in value terms. This wasmainly
attributed to a resurgencein retained imports which increased by6 percent.

Asia. In 1997, the fallout of the Asian financial crisis and the subsequent
tight domestic monetary conditions have brought about an adjustment in
asset prices. The key challenge to the Government of the HKSAR is to
moderate the economic slowdown, while at the same time preserving the
linked exchange rate system that has served the country well for more
than a decade.

Republic of Korea
Economic performance

Economic growth: A fter reaching its peak at the end of 1995, growth
in the Republic of Korea’s economy began to slowdown and has remained
in a downtum phase. The growth rate, which rose to ashigh as8.9 percent
in 1995, dropped to 7.1 percent in 1996, and declined further to 5.5 percent
in 1997. The slowdown in 1996 largely resulted fromslack in external demand,
falling prices of semiconductors, and sluggish capital investments. In 1997,
even though exports increased in real terms, the downward trend in other
major sectors of the economy continued from the previous year. Equipment
investment decreased through the year due to the weakened profitability of
businesses and the uncertainty of future economic prospects. Construction
investment also continued its subdued pace, asslackening building construction was barely offset by robust infrastructure-related construction. The growth
of consumer spending dropped steeply, compared with the previous year, in
view of concerns over job security and the level of corporate bankruptcies.
Exports, in real terms, increased sharply after the second quarter, helped by
asharp pickupin exports of heavy industrial and chemical products, such as
semiconductors and refined petroleum products. As an outcome of slower
economic growth, the unemployment rate rose from 2 percent in 1996 to
2.6 percent in 1997. This was despite a decrease in the economically active
population as many ceased their job search due to the continued economic
slowdown.

Inflation: T he Republic of Korea’s inflation rate decreased to 4.5 percent in 1997 from 4.9 percent in 1996. The prices of manufactured goods
showeda rapid increase due to higher import pricesinduced by the weakening
ofthe won against the dollar, more than offsetting the slack domestic demand.
Prices of farm products declined owing to good harvests. The pace of wage
increases, which hasplayeda crucial role in aggravating the businessenvironment,
moderated from 11.9 percent in 1996 to 8.5percent in 1997.

External sector. The Republic of Korea suffered serious deterioration
in its balance of payments in 1996. However, its exports reversed their
trend in the second quarter of 1997 and continued a strong expansion
thereafter. Merchandise exports increased by 7.2 percent during 1997,
compared with 4.1 percent in 1996. This was mainly due to the increase
in export volumes, helped by the sharp pickup in exports of heavy industrial and chemical products. Meanwhile, the unit price index of exports
dropped, owing to such factorsas the steady weakening of semiconductor
prices. Merchandise imports decreased by2.3 percent in 1997 following
a 12.2 percent increase in 1996, largely in response to the sluggishRegional Highlights

 

consumption and the decline in investments. The trade balance, which Republic of Korear

shifted into the black in August, registered a deficit of $2.8 billion for the Lending and Dishursements
year. The deficit on invisibles and transfers, which grew very rapidly until
the third quarter and then reverted into surplus in the fourth quarter,
ended at $6 billion. The current account deficit improved to $8.8 billion Antal 19934997
from the previous year’s level of $23.1 billion.

Domestic policies Internal financial problems and external liquidity
shortages, which were aggravated in the latter part of 1997, resulted in
the deterioration of the Republic of Korea’s creditworthiness in international
financial markets and reduction in capital inflows. In December 1997, the
Government sought an IMF financial assistance package totaling $57 billion, including ADB assistance of $4 billion. In accordance with the
standby arrangement, the Government adopted a number of measures to
strengthen its economy and pledged to continue implementing reform.
policies. Many measuresin the IMF restructuring program are in accordance
with the policy direction that the Government adopted in response to the
economic slowdown in 1996. The onset of the financial crisis, however,
provided momentum for a rapid implementation of the necessary
macroeconomic and financial reforms. The main objective of the monetary
policyis to contain inflation and limit the downward pressure on the won.
A tight fiscal policy will be maintained to alleviate the burden on monetary
policy and to provide for the still uncertain costs of restructuring the
financial sector. In December 1997, the Korean Asset Management
Corporation started to purchase nonperforming assets from banks and
merchant banks. The Government suspended the operations of 14 troubled
merchant banks. To strengthen supervision over the financial sector, the
Financial Supervisory Institution was established. T he autonomy of the
Central Bank has also been strengthened.

Operational strategy: In the backdrop of the serious financial difficulties
encountered toward the end of the year, the Republic of Korea approached
IMF for assistance. The basic objective of the IMF-led assistance package
was to restore market confidence, which is to be achieved using a twopronged strategy. First, a strong economic program, i.e., macroeconomic
stabilization with bold policy action and structural reforms designed to
tackle weaknesses, was needed. Second, a sufficiently large package of
assistance wasneeded so that markets would be reassured that the country
could meet its external payment obligations. On the basis of an assessment
of requirements, IMF originally estimated that official assistance of the
order of $55 billion would be needed. An IMF-led international assistance
package was put together. IMF would provide $21 billion over a threeyear period. T his would be supplemented by assistance of $14 billion from
ADB and World Bank. The balance of $20 billion would be provided
through bilateral assistance from Australia, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, UK, and US.

IMF under the Standby Arrangement. As the recent crisis has served to
highlight certain basic weaknesses in the Republic of Korea’s financial
sector, the Bank’s operations sought to restore market confidence and
prevent recurrence of such events through support for far-reaching financial
sector reforms. The Government embarked on an ambitious program for
reforming the financial sector. The Bank’s program | oan willcarrythis

recting policyand structural weaknesses. The loan has
been designed to (i) provide for prudential and regulatory supervision of the banking and other subsectors
through an independent agency; (ii) increase competition within the sector and thus subject firms to market
discipline; (iii) enhance efficiency by promoting the
orderly development of capital markets and the introduction of new financial products and participants;
and (iv) provide the market — investors and creditors — with transparent financial and accounting
information.

gram loan, the single largest assistance package ever
advanced by the Bank, to assist the Republic of Korea.
In the face of the currency and liquidity crises, the crucial component was
the availability of adequate supplies of foreign exchange. As part of the
assistance package, a technical assistance loan of $15 million was provided for
institutional strengthening of the financial sector.

Project implementation: All 79 loans which the Bank had previously
provided prior to 1988, when the Republic of Korea stopped borrowing,
have been financially closed and fully disbursed as of end-1996. The first
tranche of $2 billion of the $4.015 billion Financial Sector Program loan
was disbursed by the end of the year.

Singapore

Economic performance

Economic growth: Singapore’seconomic growth slowed down in 1996, as
world demand for computer-related electronics (especially semiconductors)
declined, but surged ahead in 1997 with 7.8 percent growth in GDP.
Manufacturing output rose by4.3 percent, spurred by chemicals, petroleum,
and electronics. Electronics account for roughly half of manufactures,
which in turn account for more than three fourths of exports, as Singapore
nowhas the world’s largest disk drive industry. There was significant
expansion in the petrochemical sector as new plants came onstream.
Commerce, in particular tourism, suffered from reduced regional demand.
The services sector, which now accounts for 66 percent of GDP, grewbyRegional Highlights

 

8.8 percent. Financial and business services, particularly foreign exchange
activity and provision of business-hub services, have grown rapidly by
11 percent in 1997, assisted by tax breaks. The construction industry,
which benefited from public investment in infrastructure, expanded by
13.3 percent and led employment growth. Except for its currency and
stock market, Singapore was mildly affected by the region’s financial crisis
in 1997.

Inflation: Money supply (M2) growth averaged 10.3 percent for the
year, and inflation increased slightly to 2 percent from 1.4 percent in
1996. Although prices for imported food from neighboring countries with
depreciated currencies declined, prices for administrative charges,
transportation, communications, water, health care, and housing increased.

External sector: The country’s high savings rate, fiscal surplus, current
account surplus, limited foreign debt, and the world’s highest per capita
foreign reserves helped the country come through the regional currency
and financial crises relatively unscathed. While the Singapore dollar
depreciated about 17 percent relative to the US dollar, it appreciated substantially
relative to most regional currencies. Exports declined by3 percent in US dollar
terms in 1997. Slowimport growth compensated for the decline in exports,
and the current account surplusasa percentage of GDP remained substantial
at 15 percent. The steady rise in net services income has played. an important
role in the current account surplus, although this was tempered in 1997
by the slowdown in tourism, resulting from the financial crisis and environmental haze from forest fires affecting the region. Increased emphasis
on outward direct investment, successive current account surpluses, and.
substantial inward-bound foreign direct and portfolio investment have led
to steady growth in international reserves.

Domestic policies Singapore maintains a concerted effort to broaden
and deepen its economy, particularly in relation to the Southeast Asian
region. The three main components of this policy are to attract foreign
investment, promote and develop the services sector, and develop smalland medium-sized enterprises. Infrastructure and technological innovation
are increasingly being stressed by the Government to boost productivity
and attract foreign investment. The Singapore ONE (One Network for
Everyone) plan to link every home by computer is intended to help
establish the country as a regional financial and product design center.
To promote its efforts to expand as a regional financial center, the
Government has undertaken a review of the banking and financial sectors.

Taipei,China
Economic performance

Economic growth: In a year of unprecedented turmoil in the financial
marketsand economic slowdown in Asia, Taipei,China avoided any major
financial crisis in 1997 although the domestic currency has depreciated
by15 percent since July 1997. Stimulated by the strong growth of private
consumption and investment, the real GDP growth rate in 1997 was
6.8 percent, higher than the 5.7 percent growth achieved in 1996. Sustained

89ANNUAL REPORT 1997

 

growth in finance, insurance and real estate, and business services
underpinned the 7.9 percent expansion in the services subsector, compared with 7.3 percent in 1996. Industry sector growth remained modest
at 5.7 percent. Real private consumption increased by 7.7 percent from.
6.2 percent in 1996. Real government consumption also grew strongly at
5.4 percent mainly because of a large increase in military expenditure.

Inflation: Inflation declined to 0.9 percent in 1997, the lowest in the
last decade, from3.1 percent in 1996. This reflects stable food prices due
to favorable weather conditions, decelerating money supply growth, and
lower imported inflation due to a decline in the world prices of industrial
rawmaterials.

External sector: The external trade account has consistently been
in surplus since the mid-1970s. In 1997, the trade surplus declined to
$13.9 billion from $17.6 billion in 1996 because of higher imports.
Taipei,China experienced a deficit on the services account in 1997, reflecting primarily rising insurance and freight charges in line with strong
import growth and increasing amounts spent abroad by tourists. Because
of the smaller trade surplus and the continuing services deficit, the current account surplus fell to $7.7 billion in 1997 from $11 billion in 1996.
Successive current account surpluses have helped the economy to build
up substantial amounts of international reserves of $83.5 billion at the
end of 1997, sufficient to cover eight months of imports.

Domestic policies: The financial storm swept across T aipei,China’s
stock and foreign exchange markets. To stem the fall of the NewT aiwan
(NT) dollar, the central bank intervened heavilyin August and September.
However, asthe financial crisisshowed no signsofabatingand the US dollar
strengthened, the central bank, in mid-October, allowed the NT dollar's
exchange rate to be fully determined by market forces. T aipei,China has
been relatively insulated from the currency crisis, the stock market decline, and the growth slowdown experienced in the region. This was
mainly because of its sound macroeconomic fundamentals and the exceptionally high foreign exchange reserves relative to t he countrys foreign
liabilities. The key challenge for T aipei,China is to moderate the spillover
effects of the Asian financial crisis and strengthen its financial system.

continued to growimpressively in 1997, registering a growth rate of
20 percent. Weak domestic demand contributed to a moderate growth of
2.5 percent in imports. This generated a record trade surplus of $46.4 billion anda current account surplus of $20 billion or 2.2 percent of GDP.
The services account, however, remained in deficit, reflecting the
underdeveloped state of the sector. The capital account showeda sizable
surplus because of the continued large inflows of foreign direct investment
(FDI) at $45 billion. The PRC ranks second among all countries of the
world in terms of FDI inflows and the first among developing countries.
FDI grewby13 percent and total foreign exchange reserves reached a new
high level of $140 billion at the end of 1997 or more than ten months
of import cover. Total outstanding external debt was $119 billion in 1997,
of which long- and medium-term debt was accountable for 85 percent.
The debt-service ratio has declined continuously from 12.6 percent in
1993 to 6.8 percent in 1996. The high level of reserves and the
nonconvertibility of the renminbi in the capital account has enabled the
PRC to avoid the adverse effects of the regional financial crisis.
Domestic policies: Reform in the SOEs progressed in 1997 and will
gather momentum in the coming years. The Fifteenth Party Congress in
September 1997 placed high priority on reforming the SOEs, which now
incur annual losses of about $80 billion. The main reason for the poor
performance of SOEs is the weak governance structure due to ill-defined
rights and duties of enterprise managers and the Government. The core
of the SOE reform is to convert the more than 300,000 SOEs into
shareholder-owned corporations and open them to foreign competition.
This would involve mergers of many companies into large corporations

and result in laying off redundant workers in these enterprises. Another
key challenge facing the PRC is the reform of its financial sector. The
asset quality of the banks has deteriorated over time and doubtful assets
now constitute a significant portion of the banking sector's portfolio. A
substantial part of these doubtful assets is accounted for by loans to the
SOEs. Cleaning the banking systems portfolio is inextricably linked to the
reform of the SOEs. A notable institutional development in the field of
monetary policy is the formation of the Monetary Policy Committee by
the State Council in April 1997, which isin accordance with the recently
enacted Central Banking Lawand reflects the resolve of the Government
to pursue a more independent monetary policy. With the wide disparity
in economic development among provinces, the Government has adopted
economic policies to reduce regional disparities and to accelerate
development in the interior provinces.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s revised country operational strategy for
the PRC was discussed with the Government in 1996 and subsequently
with the Board of Directors in February 1997. The strategy emphasizes
three broad objectives: (i) enhancing economic efficiency; (ii) promoting,
growth to reduce poverty in poor inland provinces; and (iii) improving
environmental protection and natural resource management. These three
broad objectives will help maximize employment creation, further eliminate
factor market distortions, and address market failures of rapid growth by
spreading the benefits of growth more evenly and reducing environmental
degradation. This strategyis fully supportive of the Govemment’s objective
of preserving social stabilityand maintaining public support for the continued
implementation of the reform program. In line with this strategy, about
two thirds of the proposed projects that are location-specific (excluding
lines of credit and sector-type projects that have national coverage) during
the period 1998-2000 will be located in the inland provinces. Within the
framework of the country operational strategy, Bank operations in the
PRC will focus on (i) strengthening macroeconomic management and
the policy, legal, and regulatory frameworks necessary to support the
continued implementation of market-oriented reforms; and (ii) addressing
issues and constraints primarily in three key sectors: physical infrastructure
(covering energy, transport, communications, and water supply); finance
and industry; and agriculture and rural development. To achieve
macroeconomic stability and improve investment efficiency, the
Government will need to continue to (i) develop greater expertise in
the use of effective fiscal and monetary policy tools; (ii) establish
efficient financial markets; (iii) accelerate enterprise reforms; and
(iv) strengthen the legal and regulatory frameworks. T hese four areas will
be the focal points of much of the Bank’s economic and sector work and
related advisory technical assistance.

Policy dialogue: The policy dialogue between the Government and.
the Bank covered a broad range of areas to support the PRC operational
program. At the macro level, the Bank is supporting fiscal reforms through
an ongoing series of technical assistance grants. During 1997, discussionsRegional Highlights

 

in the area of fiscal reform focused on social security, off-budget revenues
and expenditures, and municipal finance. As part of the ongoing Bank
assistance in strengthening governance in the financial sector, issues were
addressed related to developinga national payments system, policies affecting
foreign and joint-venture banks, and reforming the rural cooperative
system. Enterprise reform to increase commercialization and responsiveness
to market forces was promoted in the context of individual projects, as
well as by providing broader assistance to address issues related to
restructuring insolvent state enterprises. Improving environmental
management continues to be a major element of the Bank’s policy dialogue
in the PRC. Environmental issues addressed in 1997 included the use of
market-based instruments for environmental management, building capacity
related to environmental impact assessment procedures, and promoting
clean coal technology. The Bank also promoted energy conservation through
policy dialogue, price adjustments to provide incentives for energy
conservation, and the provision of technical assistance. T o help mobilize
the resources necessary to finance the huge infrastructure expenditures
that are neededin the PRC, the Bank isactively promoting tariff adjustments
to enhance cost recovery. The Bank also playsa leading role in promoting
alternative sources of financing (e.g., build-operate-transfer; leasingand
securitization) in the transport, energy, and water resources sectors.

Loans and technical assistance: Five loans totaling $656 million
were approved in 1997, which wasa decline in volume from recent annual
levels. The Government's attention to project quality, provision of adequate
counterpart funds, and careful preparation of new projects, particularly
in the context of declining domestic growth rates and concerns about
foreign debt exposure and currencyrisks, largelyaccounted for the slowdown. Of the five loans approved, two were for transport projects($250 million), and one each for environmental improvement ($156 million), energy
($150 million), and social infrastructure ($100 million). Thirty-six technical
assistance grants were approved in 1997, amounting to $19.5 million. Of
these, ten were for the preparation of new projects.

Project implementation: Of the 64 loans approved as of end-1997,
17 had been closed and 47 were under implementation, including six
waiting to become effective. During the year, contracts amounting to
$693.6 million were awarded, bringing cumulative contract awards to
$3,897.4 million. The contract award ratio for 1997 was 25.6 percent.
Disbursements for the year amounted to $714.7 million. Cumulative
disbursements reached $3,355 million. The disbursement ratio for 1997
was 19.6 percent. The PRC portfolio performed generally well due to
several contributing factors: (i) rigorous screening process before projects
are proposed for Bank financing; (ii) strong technical capabilities of the
executing and other government agencies; (iii) strong ownership of the
projects by executing agencies, local governments, and government
authorities; and (iv) clear accountability for project implementation.

Mongolia
Economic performance

Economic growth: Economic growth recovered despite continuing problems
in the banking sector, a softening of international copper prices, and
constraints in energy supplies. Real GDP growth in 1997 increased to
3.3 percent from 2.4 percent in the previous year. The services sector,
growing by5.3 percent, provided the main impetus for the improved
economic performance. The stability in the exchange rate, the initiation
of bank restructuring and reforms, and the abolition of price controls
contributed to the services sector growth. Agricultural output, which
accounts for almost 37 percent of GDP, grewby2.6 percent. The increase
in livestock and higher cashmere output was offset by weak meat prices
and lower international prices of cashmere. Crop harvest, however, improved
as a supply response to an improved policy environment, due to the
liberalization of wheat prices and favorable weather conditions. The industry
sector recovered with a 2.3 percent growth, compared with 0.5 percent
in 1996. The decline in output of SOEs continued to offset the gains made
in the private manufacturing sector.

Inflation: The inflation rate began to decline during the latter half
of 1997 as seasonal factors became positive with the beginning of the
livestock slaughtering season and the onset of the new wheat harvest in
October. Also, most large price adjustments have been completed, pushing
down inflation to an annual average rate of 20 percent from 49.6 percent
in 1996.

External sector: T otal export earnings reached $461 million, an
increase of about 9 percent from the 1996 level, owing to the increase
in copper and gold exports. Cashmere exports continued to decline, reflecting
the drop in international prices. Imports declined by 1.5 percent. The
trade deficit has become smaller and the current account deficit improved
to 5.6 percent of GDP. The inflow of concessional external finance was
substantially larger in 1997 and was sufficient to finance the current
account deficit and build up net foreign exchange reserves to $89.9 million by the end of 1997.

Domestic policies The Government has restored the momentum of
reforms, and reached agreement with IMF on anew three-year stabilization
and structural reform program which provides the framework for maintaining
macroeconomic stabilityin the near term. The uncertainties associated
with the transition process are still significant but the completion of price
and tariff reforms, accelerated privatization, and a greater role of the
private sector are gradually creating the basis for more stable growth in
the country. With fiscal balance as one of the main components of theRegional Highlights

deterioration of health, education, and other social services have become
major areas of concern. While the long-term solution to the rising social
concems rests on sustained economic growth, these social problems must Mongolia:

be made to the operational program to accommodate these shifting
development emphases and priorities as economic recovery progresses.
Policy dialogue: The Bank’s 1997 program reflected the policy dialogue
undertaken with the Government on major issues in Mongolia’s energy,
health, urban, and water supply sectors. Asa result of the Bank’s policy
dialogue in the energy sector, the Energy Authority is on track in implementing the Energy Law of 1996, increasing tariffs in January 1997 and
removing subsidies for small consumers in May 1997. In addition, the
Government has agreed to implement an automatic quarterly tariff
adjustment mechanism to cover cost increases arising from higher fuel
costs, inflationary trends, and exchange rate depreciation. The Bank
provided policy advice to the Government with respect to restructuring
the electricityand heat sector and to introducing private sector participation.
A major focus of the policy dialogue was the improvement of primary
health care systems with increased private sector participation. The resulting
introduction of family group practices and a capitation payment system
— changing the modes of payment to health service providers to introduce
market signals and incentives for improving cost efficiency for the delivery
of primary health care — will result in the provision of cost-efficient
services. The Bank provided policy advice regarding issues related to the
urban and water supply sectors which covered decentralization, investment
priorities, institutional reforms and strengthening of local agencies, and
cost recovery. Asa result, the Government agreed to undertake a thorough
reassessment of its investment plans and priorities in the urban sector.
The Government is more committed to increase self-financing capabilities
for infrastructure development in provincial capitals through tariff reforms
and introduce appropriate cost-recoverymechanisms. The Bank coordinated

its policy dialogue with the Government, IMF, World Bank, and other
aid agencies.

Loans and technical assistance: Four loans for three projects totaling
$62.7 million were approved in 1997 in the energyand social infrastructure
sectors. The Ulaanbaatar Heat Efficiency Project will improve district
heating in the world’s coldest capital and will improve sector efficiency
byintroducinga tariffand billing system based on metered heat consumption.
The Health Sector Development Program and Provincial Towns Urban
Services Project will support policy reforms in the social infrastructure
sector, particularly health, water supply, sanitation, and solid waste disposal
services. Fourteen technical assistance grants totaling $7.4 million were
approved, of which five were for the preparation of new projects.

Project implementation: Of the 19 loans approved as of end-1997,
three had been closed and 16 were under administration. During the year,
contract awards and disbursementsamounted to $52.2 million and $67.4 million, respectively. The respective cumulative figures were $257.7 million.
and $210.2 million. The contract award ratio for 1997 was 37.1 percent,
while the disbursement ratio was 39.4 percent. In September 1997, a
country project implementation and administration seminar was held to
familiarize staff of executing agencies and other government offices with.
the Bank’s policies and procedures on procurement, use of consultants,
and disbursements. During the country portfolio review undertaken in
September, the Mongplian project directors and managersagreed to establish.
a forumand hold informal meetings on a quarterly basis to address problems
related to project implementation. The Bank plans to provide technical
assistance to help the Government identifyand address key implementation
issues. The Bank isalso preparinga technical assistance in the development
of procurement legislation and implementing guidelinesand capacity building
for project accountants in the executing agencies of Bank-financed projects.

Economic growth: The economy of Kazakstan grewat an annual rate of
2 percent in 1997, higher than the 0.5 percent expansion in 1996. The
strength of the economy comes from the export-oriented sectors dealing
with oil, gas, and some nonferrous metals. These sectors have benefited
relatively from the terms-of-trade shift since independence and have
received the bulk of FDI in the country. Agriculture depends heavily on
rainfed grain and while crop production improved, there is little sign of

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The main objectives of the country operational
strategy include (i) encouraging the transition to a market-based economy
bysupporting the Government's reform agenda, promoting institutional
change and strengthening social protection; (ii) promoting the rehabilitation
of the environment; (iii) strengthening the long-term potential for sustainable growth; and (iv) encouraging the creation of anew output structure and new production capacity through private sector investment.
Cofinancing with other donors is actively sought to address difficulties in
sourcing local counterpart funds.

Kazakstan’s developmental needs are vast, but the Bank's resources
and experience in working with the country are limited. Moreover, other
funding agencies provide extensive support and technical assistance.
Therefore, Bank activities will focus on a limited number of strategic
sectors and subsectors: (i) strengthening the management of reform at the
Central Government and local government levels; (ii) infrastructure,
especially rehabilitation projects; (iii) education and training; (iv) industry,
focusing on the problems of medium-sized enterprise reform; and
(v) agriculture. In implementing this strategy, a number of strategic
considerations must be addressed, including coordination with other
multilateral finance institutions.

Several of the sectors in which the Bank will be active involve crossborder issues within the subregion of Central Asia. Notable examplesare
transport, electric power, the environment, and water resources. Beyond.
ensuring that its activities in each country are consistent with what is being
done in the others, the Bank will endeavor to undertake regional investment
and policy coordination, and promote efforts to ensure a rational pattem. of
resource use in the area asa whole.

Policy dialogue: Discussions were held in support of policy and
institutional reforms in agriculture, education, and the pension system.
The main objectives of policy dialogue were to (i) improve the efficiency
of water resource management in selected areas in south Kazakstan;
(ii) rationalize the education sector and improve the efficient use of basic
education resources; and (iii) support the transition of the existing pay-as-yougo pension system to a fully funded, defined contribution system. The policy
support program also explored possibilities of regional cooperation among
PRC, Kazakstan, KyrgyzRepublic, and Uzbekistan in areas such as transport
and communications, energy, payment systems, and trade policy.

Loans and technical assistance: Five loans totaling $185 million
were approved in support of the Government’s efforts in strengthening
basic education and water resource management, and reforming the pension.
system. The Bank also approved seven technical assistance grants amounting
to $3.9 million. Of these, two were for the preparation ofnew projects.

Project implementation: Of the ten loans extended to Kazakstan
since it became a member in 1994, nine are under implementation. In
1997, contracts amounting to $99.5 million were awarded, resulting in a
contract award ratio of 36.4 percent, while disbursements were $71.6 million. The disbursement ratio for 1997 was 54 percent. Cumulative contractsawarded totaled $198.2 million and disbursements were $167.6 million.Regional Highlights

 

In view of the continuing expansion of the Bank’s loan and technical
assistance portfolio, the approval of the establishment of the Kazakstan

industry, the services sector has been somewhat sluggish in 1997. The Energy 1 30.0 12.0
progress made in macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform has

Inflation: Inflation continued to decline from 30 percent in 1996

helped to subdue domestic inflationary pressures, as did greater stability
in nominal exchange rates. Broad money growth slowed down from Kyrgyz Republic:

External sector: External balances remain fragile, although some
improvement is detectable. The importation of capital goods needed to
develop the Kumtor mine has, to some extent, exacerbated trade and
current account deficits, but structural weaknesses are also apparent.
Although investment-related imports for the Kumtor gold mine were
reduced in 1997, the current account deficit was still substantial at 10.5 percent of GDP. Imports for consumer goods have gone upas the continued
economic recovery increased the demand for consumer goods. The Kyrgyz
Republic continues to rely largely on official transfers to finance its current
account deficits.

Domestic policies Significant progress has been made in achieving
macroeconomic stabilization. The contraction in output has ended; inflation
and the fiscal deficits have been reduced; external trade has expanded;
a credible stabilization policy has been established; and international
reserves have been built up. The Goverment has made efforts to accelerate
structural reform, including privatization of many SOEs; long-term leases
of agricultural land; restructuring of the banking sector; liberalization of
the external trade and exchange rate system, and the development of a
legal framework required for a market economy.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The primary objective of the operational strategy
is to facilitate the country’s transition to a market economy and to help
the country build a solid base for sustainable development. The basic
elements of the strategy include (i) supporting the Government's reform
agenda, encouraging institutional change, and strengthening social
protection; (ii) arresting the rapid deterioration of economic potential by
investing in physical infrastructure and human development; and
(iii) encouraging the creation ofa newoutput structure, andnewproduction
capacity through private sector investment and job creation. The strategy
concentrates the Bank’s operations on four priority areas: (i) improvements
in the provision of public services, particularly social services provided by
local governments, and management of reform by the Central Government;
(ii) agriculture, including rural finance; (iii) human development; and
(iv) infrastructure, especially in the road and energy sectors.

Policy dialogue: The Bank’s policy dialogue with the Government
focused on supporting policy and institutional reforms in the infrastructure,
rural finance, and education sectors and strengthening the competitiveness
of enterprises as well as improving their corporate governance. Key policy
areas addressed included (i) establishing appropriate funding and costrecovery mechanisms in the road subsector; (ii) providing the institutional
framework to support a credit union system for rural finance; (iii) improving
the efficiency of the education sector and the quality ofbasic education; and
(iv) encouraging greater efficiency through incentivesand improved corporate
structure and governance in public and private enterprises. Special efforts
were also made to promote regional cooperation among neighboring DMCs
in communications, transport, energy, and payment systems.

Loans and technical assistance: Five loans totaling $89.2 million
were approved to support the Government's efforts in strengthening the
education sector and corporate governance and in establishing a rural
credit union network. Five technical assistance grants amounting to
$3.6 million were also approved. Of these, two were for the preparation
of new projects.

Project implementation: As of end-1997, nine loans totaling
$249.2 million had been approved for the Kyrgyz Republic. Contract
awards in 1997 amounted to $55.2 million, while disbursements reached.
$51.9 million. In 1997, the contract award and disbursement ratios were
42.4 percent and 36.8 percent, respectively. A country project
implementation and administration seminar was held in October 1997 to
familiarize executing agencystaff with the Bank’s procedures and guidelines
on procurement and use of consultants.

difficulties, the Government adopted programs of macroeconomic
stabilization and structural reform to contain the decline in output, reduce
inflation and the fiscal deficit, and improve the balance-of-payments
position. Progress has been made in achieving many of these objectives.
After a persistent decline from 1990 through 1995, real GDP grewby
1.6 percent in 1996, led bya strong performance of the trading sector and
arecovery in industry. Economic performance improved further in 1997,
registering growth of 5.2 percent. The recovery in income was reasonably
broad-based, with agriculture sector growth at 5.8 percent and industry
sector growth at 6.5 percent. The agriculture, energy,
mining, and services sectors performed well due to
their comparative advantage and growing private sector
activity. Output of petroleum and natural gas continued to increase as a result of the Government’s
efforts to encourage development of the sector. The
services sector also expanded in 1997 as private sector
activity grew significantly in urban retail trading,
restaurants, bars, hotels, and taxi services. Industry
continued to experience difficulties as enterprise
reforms resulted in downsizing and closure of nonviable state enterprises.

Inflation: Inflation declined further to about
30 percent in 1997 from more than 60 percent in
1996. The Government's tighter fiscal stance, an
expansion in agricultural output, anda general easing
of shortages and bottlenecks all helped to reduce

External sector. The balance-of-payments situation improved in 1997

after difficulties in 1996. The current account deficit declined from7.9 percent of GDP in 1996 to about 6 percent of GDP in 1997, resulting from
an improvement in the merchandise trade account. T otal exports grew
steadily in 1997 because of increases in exports of energy and manufactured goods. Import growth was constrained in 1997 as the Government’s
efforts to increase grain production reduced the need for grain imports.
Imports were also restrained by foreign exchange restrictions introduced
by the authorities in late 1996.

Domestic policies Uzbekistan adopted gradual approach to structural
reform and progress has been achieved in the transition to a market
economy. Prices of consumer goods were liberalized; prices of oil and oil
products were brought closer to world market levels; and privatization of
small enterprises and housing is virtually complete. T 0 offset the impact of
Price increases, the Government continued to adjust the minimum wage, thus
imposing additional burden on the budget. Conscious ofthe need to minimize
the social cost of the transition froma centrally planned to a market economy,
the Goverment considers the provision of social services and protection for
vulnerable groups as integral components of the reform process. The restoration of fiscal balance is also a principal goal of the Government’s macroeconomic stabilization program. During 1997, the Government persevered
with a conservative fiscal policystance and the consolidated state budget
deficit was maintained at 3 percent of GDP. Despite resource constraints,

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’sinterim operational strategy for Uabekistan,
is aimed at assisting the Government to further the transition to a market
economy. This entails providing support for policy reforms, capacity building,
and institutional strengthening; and sector investments that promote
growth, improve efficiency, and rehabilitate deteriorating infrastructure.
The strategy sharply focuses the Bank’s assistance program in the near
termon three priority sectors: (i) agriculture, including financial support
of small and medium agro-industrial enterprises; (ii) infrastructure
rehabilitation, especially in the road and railway subsectors; and
(iii) education. The Bank’s technical assistance projects will focus on
sector studies to lay the foundation for future sector lending programs,
institutional strengthening, and capacity building, In addition, the Bank
will play a catalytic role in mobilizing cofinancing sources.

Policy dialogue: The Bank’s operations in Uzbekistan began in 1996.
In developing the first loan project, the Bank started the process of policy
dialogue. The initial focus was on reforms needed to create a marketoriented, competitive, and efficient agro-processing subsector. During
1997, extensive discussions were held with the authorities to accelerate
the overall pace of structural reforms. The policy dialogue in 1997 focused
on the following areas: (i) policy and institutional reforms in the roads
subsector; (ii) restructuring of the national railways and policy initiatives
to enhance financial sustainability; and (iii) reforms in agriculture to
provide incentives for augmenting productivity and increasing private
investment. The Bank also actively supports regional cooperation of
Uzbekistan with other DMCsin the areas of transportation, energy, trade,
and payments systems.

Loans and technical assistance: T wo loans for one project amounting
to $40 million were approved in 1997. Six technical assistance grants
amounting to $4.35 million were also approved. T wo of these were for
the preparation of new projects.

Project implementation: A Rural Enterprise Development Project
amounting to $50 million, approved in December 1996, became effective
in June 1997. Twonewloansamounting to $40 million were still waiting
to become effective. No contract awards or disbursements were made in
1997. During the year, a seminar was held to familiarize government
officials with the Bank’s operational policies and procedures, including
those relating to project implementation. During 1997, the Bank approved the establishment of the Uzbekistan Resident Mission, which is
expected to expedite project implementation.

the subregion. Since then, the Indonesian and Philippine governments GDP Geowth Rares

have floated their currencies and the Malaysian ringgit has depreciated
as well. These events have put pressure on banks and other financial
institutions. The most severely affected country in terms of economic
growth was Thailand, which registered negative growth, followed by
Indonesia with 4.6 percent, Philippines with 5.1 percent, and Malaysia
with 7.5 percent. Following the depreciation of the Thai baht, the Lao
kip depreciated by as much as 40 percent although the low level of
monetization of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has
buffered the real economy from the contractionary effects of the crisis.
Viet Nam, with a closed capital account, has remained relatively insulated
from direct financial pressures of these currency depreciations. Cambodia’s
economic slowdown was largely due to the political crisis in July 1997,

while Myanmar’s dual exchange rate system has increased its economy’s
vulnerability to the regional financial crisis. The subregion’s countries
confront this financial crisis with comparatively high savings ratios, historically strong fiscal positions, and history of market-friendly policies
which have produced economic success. These fundamentals suggest that

if ongoing reforms, especially in the financial and public sectors, are

Economic performance

 

Economic growth: Cambodia’s economy in 1997 exhibited a general
slowdown in growth. GDP growth was2 percent (5 percent below target),
compared with robust growth of 7.4 percent in 1996. The sharp reduction.
in real GDP growth is largely due to the political crisis in early July that
severely disrupted economic activity and slowed the economy's regional
integration. In particular, the rapidly expanding key subsectors of the
garment industry, construction, and tourism were seriously affected. The
extent of the economic slump is manifested in the contraction of the Cambodia:

services sector by0.4 percent, after an average growth of 8 percent in Cumulative Bank Lending
previous years, and the sharp downturn in industry sector growth to (as of 31 December 1997)
0.6 percent, compared with 11 percent growth in previous years. The
agriculture sector, which contributes 44 percent of GDP and provides

employment to75 percent of the labor force, grewby4.9 percent, due in part

Anal 19934997 formally agreed performance criteria.

Domestic policies: Cambodia urgently needs a revival in foreign
tourism, FDI, and external assistance. Political stabilityand a permanent
cessation of hostilities in the northwest of the country will, in part,
determine the pace of much-needed recovery, particularly in regard to
tourism and foreign investment. External assistance providers are closely
monitoring the actions of the Government in implementing the structural
reform agenda, which aims to complete the transition to a durable market
economy. The main thrust of the fiscal policyis taxation reform to broaden
the revenue base, maintain spending within acceptable levels, and mobilize more revenue through improved tax and.revenue collection measures.
The adoption of the Lawon Taxation in February 1997 was aimed at
expanding the revenue base. However, the Goverment has been slowin
implementing the provisions of the law, which inhibited the achievement
of the budget revenue targets.

 

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy in Cambodia is
focused on (i) building capacity for good govemance and project management

through an integrated program of technical assistance and sector program
lending activities; (ii) human development asa national priority with a

focus on the provision of basic health and education services, especially
in rural areas; (iii) promoting economic growth as the principal means of
creating employment and reducing poverty; and (iv) natural resource
conservation and environmental protection as critical inputs for sustain
able development, taking account of the Government's limited financial

and technical resources.

Policy dialogue: In light of Cambodia’s nascent stage of economic
development and transition to a market economy, it is essential for the
Bank to continue dialogue with the Government on macroeconomic
management, particularly public investment planning, and policyreform
in the agriculture, finance, and trade and industry sectors. The Bank also
assisted in strengthening good governance practices in Cambodia in various
areas such as external auditing, public procurement, project accounting,
external aid management, and national account statistics.

Loans and technical assistance: No new loans were approved in
1997. Three technical assistance projects were approved for a total amount
of $1.91 million.

Project implementation: Ten loanstotaling $247.7 million had been
approved as of end-1997. Eight loans are currently under administration.
Contractsamounting to $41.5 million were awarded, bringing the cumulative
total to $129.7 million. The contract award ratio for 1997 was 31.1 percent. Disbursements in 1997 totaled over $10.7 million, with cumulative
disbursements totaling $96.8 million. The disbursement ratio for 1997 was
6.9 percent. Due to rapid expansion of the loan portfolio in 1996 with

five newloans totaling $105 million, the disbursement ratio deteriorated
rapidly in 1997. The political disturbance in July 1997 also delayed project
implementation. Institutional strengthening and capacity building are
keys to efficient project implementation. As of end-1997, the Bank had
provided technical assistance amounting to about $40.8 million, along
with cofinancing of about $9.8 million from other sources. Approximately
60 percent of the technical assistance is focused on capacity building and
institutional development. A regional technical assistance was provided
by the Bank for capacity building in project accounting in Cambodia,
Lao People’s Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam, to help improve good.
governance through the Govermment’s adherence to submission of audited
financial accounts.

Indonesia
Economic performance

Economic growth: Despite the economy's strong performance during the
first half of 1997, the rupiah began to weaken in the second week of July
1997, following the floating of the Thai baht, and by the end of the year
had fallen precipitously. GDP growth for the whole of 1997 declined to
4.6 percent owing to subdued increases in all components of aggregate
demand. Growth in the manufacturing sector slowed to 6 percent on
account of liquidity constraints. A griculture sector performance was seriously
hampered by the El Nifio-related drought. At the same time, the forest
fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan have imposed real resource costs and
dampened tourism, which isa major foreign exchange earner.

Inflation: The steep decline in the rupiah’s exchange rate fueled inflation. This was evident in the last two months of 1997 when the CPI
increased bymore than 10 percent, although for the whole year inflation was
recorded at only6.6 percent. Following the currency's depreciation, the prime
lending rate reached30 percent, compared with 20 percent in 1996.

External sector: Export growth in 1997 rose to 11.2 percent. Import
growth, on the other hand, decelerated markedly, resulting in a larger
trade surplus and smaller current account deficit. With the depreciated
currency, debt service in rupiah termsis significantly higher. Public sector
debt continued to drop due to accelerated repayment of high-cost loans.
Nevertheless, the apparent creditworthiness of Indonesian borrowers,
coupled with low-interest foreign commercial loans, increased corporate
exposure to short-term external debt. International reserves were about
$19 billion bythe end of December, including $3 billion drawn from the
IMF standby facility in November 1997.

Domestic policies: To restore investor confidence and shore up
foreign exchange reserves, the Government and IMF in late 1997 agreed
upon a financial assistance package of $23 billion, including ADB support
of $3.5 billion over the next three years. The Government has committed
to implement a range of reforms, including restructuring the financial
sector; reducing import and export tariffs; removing trading monopolies for
some key staple foods; and allowing foreign companies to set up their own

stability in the foreign exchange and capital markets and resuming sustained long-term economic growth.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s current operational strategy for Indonesia
supports the Government's objectives of growth with stabilityand equity.
The current strategy emphasizes promotion of efficient growth as its
centerpiece to raise the country's international competitiveness by improving,
total factor productivity. This is to be achieved by (i) improving physical
infrastructure; (ii) enhancing the quality and productivity of human
resources; and (iii) integrating sustainable resource management and
environmental protection. The strategy calls for the Bank to activelysupport
the Government's ongping effortsat liberalizing the economyand carrying out
policy changes to improve efficiency. The strategy also underscores the
importance of more balanced regional development by intensifying the
Bank’s support of activities in less-developed areas, including the eastern
islands where poverty is more severe than the national average. In light
of the financial turmoil that began in mid-1997 and intensified later in the
year, the Bank is reviewing the strategy and reprioritizing the operational
program. The newstrategy will have to paycloser attention and put greater
emphasis on keyissuesin the banking sector and capital markets, public sector
financial management, and further industry and trade sector reforms. At the
same time, the newstrategy willneed to addresssocial and economic dislocations
arising out of the economic crisis.

Policy dialogue: A centerpiece of policy dialogue during the year was
the currency and financial crises, including problems in the banking
sector, capital markets, and public finance. The ADB’s policy dialogue on
the financial sector was carried out in coordination with IMF and the
World Bank toward the formulation of a major financial sector program
loan as part of the bigger IMF assistance package. Policy dialogue also
dealt with other major sectoral issues. In the agriculture Avater resource
subsector, the dialogue addressed (i) beneficiary participation in planning,
implementation, andmanagement; (ii) options for sustainable management
of irrigation and water supply systems, and enhanced cost recovery;
(iii) innovative financial and technical assistance modalities to farmers or
farmer groups, and (iv) policy and institutional reforms for the sector to
respond more efficiently to the changing domestic and global trade
environment. In the urban sector, substantive progress was made in
decentralization, with provincial and local governmentsbeing: fully. involved
in project planning, implementation, and financing portion of investment
requirements. In the transport sector, policy dialogue focused on issues
of public-private partnership in infrastructure financing, financial and
administrative autonomy of state-owned corporations, transport sector
safety, service charges, and cost recovery. In the education and health
sectors, policy dialogue continued to focus on closer interagency cooperationRegional Highlights

 

and coordination, efficient planning of education and health financing,
and promotion of private education and health systems.

Loans and technical assistance: Fourteen loans for 12 projects,
totaling $1,108.8 million, were approved during the year, of which $30 million for two projects were financed from the Bank's concessional funds
to blend with loans funded by the Bank’s ordinary capital resources. The
total approved amount washigher than the approved lending of $952.1 million in 1996. Five loans were for the agriculture Wvater resource development
sector ($313.4 million), two for education ($260 million), one for health
($87.4 million), three for the urban sector ($224 million), and two for
transport ($224 million). The Bank also approved 20 technical assistance
grants totaling $10.16 million. Of these, ten were for the preparation of
new projects.

Project implementation: Of the 235 loans approved as of end-1997,
153 were closed and 82 were under administration. Eleven loans were
waiting to become effective. Contract awards during the year totaled
$422.4 million, bringing the cumulative total to $7,671.6 million. The
contract award ratio for 1997 was 11 percent. T otal disbursements for the
year amounted to $676.6 million, with cumulative disbursements, including
interest during construction and private sector loans, reaching $8,218.2 million. The disbursement ratio for 1997 was 14.7 percent. The disbursements
for the year were lower than projected due mainly to shortage in counterpart
fundsbecause of the economic difficulties stemming from the currency turmoil
encountered since the middle of the year. Project implementation continued
to be generally satisfactory with the Indonesia Resident Mission (IRM) providing assistance to the Govemment and executing agencies. An increasing
number of projects have been delegated to IRM for administration; anda
disbursement unit was also established within IRM in October 1997 to expedite disbursements. With a view to address several cross-sectoral project
implementation issues, a country portfolio review was conducted jointly
with the Government in November 1997. Also, a country project
implementation and administration seminar was held in April 1997 to
familiarize executing agency staff with the Bank’s procedures and guidelines on procurement, use of consultants, and disbursements.

Lao PDR
Economic performance

Economic growth: The Lao PDR continued its steady growth of the
1990s through 1997, although flooding in 1996 took its toll on growth
in GDP which slipped to 6.9 percent. In 1997, more favorable weather
conditions and increased government incentives to farmers augured well
for the agriculture sector (particularly crops) as it recorded a substantial
increase in output from the 1996 level. Being a landlocked economy
heavily dependent on trade with its neighbors, particularly with Thailand,
the Lao PDR has not escaped the effects of the Southeast Asian financial
crisis. However, the heavy dependence of the economy on subsistence
agriculture and a correspondingly low level of monetization buffered the

real economy from the contractionary effects of the crisis to some
extent. The improved performance in the agriculture sector as well as
the expansion in the services sector boosted GDP growth to 7.2 percent in 1997.

Inflation: With the Thai baht as the principal currency for crossborder trading between the Lao PDR and Thailand, much of the inflation
has been imported. Estimates indicate that inflation edged up to over
19 percent in 1997 due to the effects of the floods on agricultural prices,
and the financial crisis in the region.

External sector: Following the rapid depreciation of the Thai baht,
uncertainty spread to the Lao kip which depreciated to a level more than
40 percent lower than at the beginning of 1997. This has improved the
Lao PDR’s export prospects. Thailand remains the principal source of
imports bya large margin but since 1994, Viet Nam has been the leading
destination for Lao PDR exports. At present, wood products remain the
largest source of export earnings followed by electricity sales.

Domestic policies Widespread use of the Thai baht andthe US dollar
limits the Central Bank’simplementation of effective monetary policy. As
the kip depreciated, restrictions were placed on the use of foreign currency
for imports. Foreign currency restrictions limited the dollars available to
the banking system and further undermined public confidence in the
Government and banks. Membership in ASEAN is expected to increase
trade liberalization and facilitate foreign investment, as is the promise of
most-favored-nation (MEN) status from the US. Asa requirement for
MEN status, the Government has adopted a legal framework which should.
also facilitate accession to the W orld Trade Organization.

Policy dialogue: The Bank’s policy dialogue with the Government
focused on energy sector efficiency. Power sector agencies were reorganizedRegional Highlights

 

andanewgrid company isexpected to be established with Bank technical
assistance. Policy dialogue resulted in an increased electricity tariff to a
level which complies with the financial covenants. In the financial sector,
restructuring the commercial banks and encouraging transparent operation
under prudential regulations continued to be emphasized during policy
dialogue. Under the Secondary Towns Urban Development Project, a
decree was issued to create Urban Development and Administration
Authorities, which enabled overall planning and management for four
provincial towns in the country. In the road sector, the Bank has discussed
institutional capacity building, privatization, and the development of a
viable and efficient domestic construction industry, and adequacy of roaduser charges. Policy dialogue also focused on developing National
Procurement Guidelines and Regulations, and on establishing an
independent national audit office for the country.

Loans and technical assistance: Three loans totaling $103 million
were approvedin 1997. Nine technical assistance grants were also approved.
for a total of $5.1 million, of which three were for project preparation.
The remaining six were advisory technical assistance.

Project implementation: Of the 42 loans approved as of end-1997,
23 had been closed and 19 were under administration. During the year,
contractsamounting to $65.9 million were awarded, bringing the cumulative
total to $540.2 million. The contract award ratio for 1997 was 31.2 percent. Disbursements in 1997 totaled $87 million and cumulative
disbursements amounted to $451.9 million. The disbursement ratio for
1997 was 32 percent. Overall performance of ongoing Bank projects was
generally good. To helpimprove the Government’sadherence to submission
of audited financial accounts, the Bank provided a regional technical
assistance for Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Viet Nam for capacity building
and good governance in project accounting. The Bank has been also
assisting the Government in preparing national procurement regulations
and strengthening its Procurement Monitoring Office.

Malaysia
Economic performance

Economic growth: The financial crisisin the region that unfolded during
the second half of 1997 dampened Malaysia’s economic performance.
Economic growth for the year slowed to 7.5 percent owing to a smaller
increase in all components of aggregate demand, in turn attributable to
diminished confidence in the markets and negative wealth effects. Fiscal
and monetary restraints also contributed to the growth slowdown. The
agriculture sector performed well, expanding by3.5 percent in 1997. Palm
oil, sawnlogs, and livestock output improved, but rubber and cocoa production declined as a result of land use conversion and labor shortages.
Manufacturing output growth eased, particularly due to the weak
performance of the electrical and electronics industry. Growth in the
construction sector also decelerated due to the imposition of a cap on
bank lending to the broad property sector and the slackening of demand

for office spaces, condominiums, and retail outlets. The services sector
was buoyant on the back of strong performance of the storage and transport
and communications subsectors. However, finance, insurance, real estate
and business services, as well as wholesale and retail trade, hotel and
restaurants, recorded lower growth.

Inflation: The aim of Malaysia’s monetary policy in 1997 was to
sustain high growth in a stable price environment. The inflation rate, as
measured by the CPI, wasslightly higher at 4 percent for the year. During
the first half of the year, the monetary policy tried to accommodate strong
growth in loans to the private sector. Since July when the effects of the
Thai financial crisis began to spill over into Malaysia and the ringgit came
under pressure, the Central Bank intervened by raising interest rates.
However, this had the effect of channeling liquidity from the stock exchange to the money market, causing a decline in equity prices. It also
dampened private sector investment.

External sector. Merchandise exports increased by about 6 percent
in 1997, slightly lower than the increase in the previous year due mainly
to continued soft global demand for electrical and electronics products.
Commodity exports increased marginally byjust under 1 percent, reflecting
the higher export volume of palm oil and palm kernel oil. Export earnings
from crude petroleum declined by 1.7 percent as global prices softened.
Mining exports registered a high growth of above 15 percent, underpinned
bya sharp increase in export of liquefied natural gas. However, growth
in exports of textiles, clothing, and footwear — traditionally the second
largest foreign exchange earner among manufactured goods— grewonly
slightly owing to stiffer competition from low-cost countries. Growth in
imports rose to around 7 percent in 1997, reflecting largely capital goods
imports and such lumpy items as ships and commercial aircraft. Imports
of intermediate and consumption goods grew more moderately due to the
ringgit’s depreciation. The higher growth of imports relative to exports
resulted in a smaller trade surplus in 1997, contributing to a wider current
account deficit of 5.5 percent of gross national product (GNP).

Domestic policies: In response to the regional financial crisis, the
Government instituted foreign exchange controls in August to stabilize
the foreign exchange and equity markets. These include restrictions on
access to ringgit in the offshore swap market, trading curbs on 100 designated
blue-chip stocks, and the use of pension and unit trust funds. However,
these proved counterproductive, stepping up the ringgit’s decline and the
exodus of investors from the stock market, prompting the lifting of these
measures. The high dependence on imports, lack of interindustry linkages,
structural weaknesses of the services sector, and high rate of investment
in the nontradable sector are being addressed to improve the current
account position. The decision to scale back or defer the implementation
of several large projects and to review the purchase of expensive foreign
goods by government agencies represented further efforts to strengthen
the balance-of-payments position. The Government also announced a
number of measures to curb imports of luxury products, increase the
savings rate, encourage exports, and develop the financial and services
sectors to reduce the country’s reliance on external resources.Regional Highlights

years which prevent the economy from moving to a higher growth path.
Myanmar’s accession to the ASEAN in 1997 is expected to further boost
trade and investment. Despite being a closed economy to a large extent,
Myanmar felt the impact of the financial crisisin the region which highlighted.
the country’s economic frailty and policy shortcomings.

Inflation: The fiscal deficit and expansionary monetary policy have
kept the inflation rate at high levels. Serious flooding in Julyand August
1997 in the south and in the Irrawaddy delta region destroyed 1.2 million
hectares of rice crop. This drove up food pricesin late 1997 which isexpected
to result in a substantial increase in consumer prices during the year.

External sector: Although financing problems have kept import
growth at moderate levels, weak export growth has kept the current
account deficit high. International reserves stood at $200 million, equivalent to about one and a half months of imports.

Domestic policies: The single most critical issue Myanmar faces is
the dual exchange rate system which, in light of the devaluations throughout
the region, has made it difficult for the country to spur growth, investment,
and trade; hold inflation at bay; and keep its shaky economy on track.
The second important issue that needs to be resolved is the recurrent
large fiscal deficit which results froma small tax base. Despite a significant
reduction in government expenditures, the nonfinancial public sector
deficit remains at 5-6 percent of GDP. This has been routinely financed
with credit from the Central Bank which contributes to inflationary pressures.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank continued to monitoreconomic developments
in Myanmar. An operational strategy will be formulated when appropriate.

Loans and technical assistance: No loan has been provided to
Myanmar since 1986 and no technical assistance since 1987.

Project implementation: Of the 32 loans approved, 31 have been
closed and one loan, which was approved in 1986, remains open with no

under this loan before Bank operations in Myanmar were held in abeyance.
The loan has been kept open at the Government's request. No contract
award or disbursement was made in 1997.

Philippines
Economic performance

Economic growth: Economic performance in 1997 was satisfactory despite
disruptions caused by the regional currency crisis in the latter half of the
year. Real GDP posted a growth rate of 5.1 percent, slightly lower than
5.7 percent achieved in 1996. Fairly creditable growth rates were achieved
by the industry and services sectors at 5.7 percent and 5.6 percent,
respectively. Notwithstanding pessimistic expectations based on the El
Nifio phenomenon which caused adverse weather conditions, including
severe droughts, the agriculture sector posted.a growth rate of 2.8 percentRegional Highlights

 

which was better than anticipated. The year witnessed substantial buildup
in stocks, sharp slowdown in imports of raw materials, and higher interest
rates. With the continuing financial market turbulence, pressure on the
peso was intense. Overall aggregate employment growth slowed down to
1.9 percent in 1997 with the agriculture sector most adversely affected.

Inflation: Inflation averaged 5.1 percent in 1997 despite the sharp
peso depreciation. Tight controls on money supply expansion, which were
maintained until about the middle of 1997, and the moderate growth in
the year, resulted in lowinflation.

External sector: The Philippines continued to sustain robust export
growth. Merchandise exports, boosted by a strong electronics sector
performance, grewby 22.8 percent in 1997, while imports grewby 14 percent. The trade deficit narrowed to $11.1 billion but the current account
deficit increased to $4.3 billion. Following the currency instability, private
capital inflows slowed markedly. By the end of 1997, overall balance of
payments recorded a deficit of $3.4 billion, which was financed through
a drawdown of reserves.

Domestic policies: The economic recovery in recent yearshasbeen
the product of stabilization and structural reforms on the one hand, and
political stability on the other. The public sector and fiscal imbalanceshave
been reducedandmany public enterprises have been privatized. Quantitative
restrictions on foreign trade have been substantially reduced and the
tariffs rationalized. FDI in almost all sectors is now allowed. A number of
domestic industries including telecommunications, shipping, and power generation have been opened to market competition. Some important tax reform.
measures, such as the Comprehensive T ax Reform Program, have been
implemented recently. In July1997, the Government responded to mounting
pressures in the currency market by floating the peso and tightening fiscal
and monetary policies. Since then, interest rates have also increased

sharply.
Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for the Philippines
was revised in 1997. In line with the Government’s updating of the
national development plan, the Bank’s newstrategy gives increased
importance in Bank operations to the reduction of poverty, human
development, promotion of regional equity, and improved environmental
management. While concern with sustaining economic growth through
support for physical infrastructure development continues to be an important
element of the Bank's strategy, the Bank’s assistance program has begun
tobe oriented towardan increased allocation of Bank resources for promoting
more equitable development throughout the country, improving the
provision of social services in keyareassuch as primary health care and basic
education, and sustaining the development of the natural resource base and.
bettermanagingand protecting the rural and urban environment. The promotion
ofmore equitable growth will require increased attention to rural development,
more balanced regional development (with special emphasis on programsand
projects for the southern Philippines), and continuation of policies to improve
the country's infrastructure, with increased emphasis on participation of the

Policy dialogue: The Bank’s policy support program in 1997 built on
earlier interventions in key sectors. The issue of governance has figured
prominentlyin the Bank’s policyagenda with the Government. Discussions
have focused on the Government's efforts to improve public sector
management, upgrade planning and administrative capacity within agencies,
developand strengthen independent regulatorybodies, decentralize functions
to local governments, and privatize public sector enterprises — all with
a viewto enhancing transparencyandaccountabilityand promoting efficiency
andeconomy. In addition to these broad issues of development administration,
the Bank’s policy dialogue with the Government also continued to focus
on the refinement of micro policies in the agriculture, water supply, road
transport, power, health, education, and environment sectors to improve
overall sector efficiencyand performance.

Loans and technical assistance: Five loans for four projects totaling
$341.6 million were approved in 1997 for power ($191.4 million), transport
and communications ($93 million), agriculture ($35.2 million), and social
infrastructure ($22 millicn).In 1997, the Bankalsoapproved15 technical

Project implementation: Of the 160 loans approved as of end-1997,
107 had been closed and 53 were under administration. Contract awards
totaled $137 million, bringing the cumulative total to $3,903.1 million.
The contract award ratio for 1997 was 10.3 percent. T otal disbursements
for the year amounted to $389.6 million and cumulative disbursements
reached $4,193.1 million. The disbursement ratio for 1997 was 24.5 percent.
A joint portfolio review with the Goverment was conducted to find solutions
to residual issues from the past and to address newones that had emerged
due to such factorsas decentralization ofnational government functionsand

the Bank held procurement seminars during the year.

Economic growth: Thailand’s recent era of high growth ended in 1997.
Initially, the downturn was mainly due to the virtual stagnation of export

growth, the Government's restrictive monetary policy, and the political
uncertainty prevailing throughout the year. This was followed by severe
pressure on the baht and the closure of several finance companies constituting the prelude to a financial crisis of unprecedented magnitude,
which spread to other economies of the region. Given the magnitude of
the crisis and the poor performance of the economy in the second half
of the year, GDP growth for the whole of 1997 was negative 0.4 percent.
The lack of liquidity, caused by the financial crisis, has severely affected
manufacturing,

Inflation: The inflation rate started rising in August 1997 mainly on
account of the higher unit value of all imports following the depreciation
of the baht. The price rise also reflects the first-round effects of an

 

increase in the value-added tax from 7 percent to 10 percent. By Decem- Thailand: :

economy. The current economic crisis has revealed flaws in Thailand’s Ania, 1993-1997
economic policy and in its institutional and sectoral structures. Many
aspects of Thailand's current economic crisis remain obscure because of
a lack of transparency and inadequate information, particularly in the
financial sector. However, the current crisis is primarily traceable to an
exchange rate policy of tying the baht to a basket of currencies heavily
weighted by the dollar, combined with imprudent lending policies, and
inadequate supervision of banks and private finance companies. These
factors also brought to the surface T hailand’s declining competitiveness
in low-technology, labor-intensive products, the shortage of skilled labor,
and the consequent difficulties of shifting to a high-technology production structure. The severe deterioration of the Thai economy reflected the
need for correction of some accumulated structural imbalances. These
adjustmentsneed to work within a framework of stabilizing macroeconomic
policies, combined with microlevel reforms in the financial sector, and
measures to improve supply-side efficiency. Stable political conditions and
sound development management are also necessary.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The operational strategy is under reviewin response
to the current economic crisis in the country. The newstrategy is expected
to redress the causes of the crisis and the longer-term factors that impede
development and undermine the quality of life. Its objectives are, therefore,
expected to be to assist the countryin (i) restoring stability in the economy;
(ii) strengthening competitiveness and sustainable growth; and
(iii) improving T hailand’s quality of life, with a focus on social and
environmental goals. To attain these objectives, the Bank will focus on
policy reform in key sectors; key supporting factors for improved
competitiveness, through support for human development, selective physical
infrastructure, rural development, and subregional economic cooperation;
and sectoral crosscutting issues with special emphasis on natural resource
management and improvement of the environment. The newstrategy is
scheduled to be finalized in 1998.

Policy dialogue: Dialogue in 1997 was extensive at both the macro
and micro levels, including the reform program of the financial and social
sectors in light of the current economic crisis in Thailand, and keyissues
in water resource management. The dialogue led to formulatinga financial
sector reform program loan approved in December
1997. This reform program included a comprehen

to domestic financial resources, and develop longterm institutional sources of funds. It was also followed by a number of policy actions and measures,
including the strengthening of the autonomy of the
Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand.
Dialogue for the water resource sector focused on
cost recovery of water services and restructuring of
water tariffs. Capacity building and decentralization
were also in the dialogue agenda for all Bank operations in the country.

($300 million). The last two loans were extended in response to the
Government's urgent need, internationally supported in light of the current economic crisis of the country. Commercial cofinancing in the amount
of $1,000 million was mobilized for the Financial Markets Reform Program loan. Technical assistance grants totaling $4.45 million for nine
projects were also approved, two of which were for project preparation.

Project implementation: Of the 77 loans approved as of end-1997,
58 had been closed and 19 were under administration. Contractsamounting
to $632.5 million were awarded, bringing the cumulative value to $2,886 million. The contract award ratio for 1997 was 42.4 percent. Disbursements

A country project implementation and administration seminar was also
conducted during the year to help executing agencies, particularly those

project implementation performance and be familiarized with Bank
procedures and requirements. The financial crisis which occurred during
the latter half of the year had serious effects on project implementation
and will require the Bank’s close monitoring on future development. As
part of the financial assistance package arranged by the IMF to deal with
the crisis, ADB provided a financial markets reform program loan amounting
to $300 million, which was fully disbursed by the end of the year. Another

bythe regional currency crisis and bya sharp real appreciation of the dong
against the currencies of Viet Nam’s trading partners. Import growth was
subdued by the introduction of import restrictions on a number of goods.
The scarcity of foreign exchange and accumulating inventories of domestic
products, particularly with the state enterprises, have prompted the
Government to reimpose import restrictions on a number of commodities.
The current account deficit in 1997 was substantial at 7.7 percent of GDP
and was financed largely by FDI and official flows.

contraction in FDI. To mitigate inflation and foreign exchange risks, more
contractionary economic policies maybe needed. A managed depreciation of the local currency would help preserve competitiveness in key
export sectors. To secure future growth in a context where other regional
economies are strengthening their industry and financial sectors, there is
a pressing need to accelerate the economic reform process. In particular,
this calls for expediting the restructuring of state enterprises and implementing reforms for making the financial and banking sector more effi
cient and transparent.
Bank operations

Operational strategy: The principal objective of the Bank’s operational
strategy for Viet Nam is to promote efficient economic growth and reduce
poverty. The strategy is designed to facilitate the transition to a market
economy, while promoting balanced and sustainable development. The
Bank’s support to Viet Nam in the medium term addresses critical constraints in the following areas: (i) policy reform and institutional development; (ii) infrastructure development; (iii) rural development; (iv) human
development; and (v) environmental and natural resource management.

Policy dialogue: A vital component of the Bank’s operations in Viet
Nam is to encourage policy and structural reforms to improve public
sector efficiency, and develop the private sector. The Bank’s first policybased loan to support the Government's A griculture Sector Program has
been concluded successfully. The major achievement of this Program is
the enhancement of market orientation and economic efficiency through
trade liberalization in input and output markets. Another policy-based
loan in the financial sector is under implementation, and aims at facilitating policy reforms to increase efficiency of the banking sector. In
addition to program lending, policy dialogue is an important feature in
all of the Bank’s loan projects. Dialogue includes support for increased
efficiency through tariff reform and other measures to increase cost recovery and strengthen financial management, policy analysis, and planning within state-owned utilities. Policy dialogue also playsan important role
inimprovingnatural resource management and environmental protection. To
facilitate policy dialogue, advisory technical assistance was provided to key
government agencies that formulate and implement policy changes.

Loans and technical assistance: The Bank approved six loans totaling
$359.6 million for the agriculture, social infrastructure, and energy sectors.
Sixteen technical assistance grants totaling $16.5 million were also approved,
three of which were for project preparation.

Project implementation: Of the 31 loans approved as of end-1997,
11 hadbeen closed and 20 were under administration. Contract awards
in 1997 amounted to $154.31 million, bringing the cumulative figure to
$351 million. The contract award ratio for 1997 was 14.5 percent.
Disbursements amounted to $149.3 million, with cumulative disbursements
reaching’ $254.7 million. The disbursement ratio for 1997 was 15.8 percent.
Viet Nam has experienced project implementation difficulties due toRegional Highlights

 

centralized decision-making procedures, lack of counterpart funds, and

lack of project management know-how. The Bank has engaged the
Government in policy dialogue and also provided technical assistance for
resolving these issues. Asa result of efforts made by the Government as
wellasthe Bank, there hasbeen an improvement in project implementation.

Project implementation reviews were frequently conducted and regular
monthly meetings held. These deliberate efforts and the cooperation
extended by the authorities have increased the disbursement ratio. How
ever, improved project implementation performance was largely attrib
uted to the smooth implementation of program loans. Greater efforts are

still required to improve disbursements under project loans and to under
stand better the Goverment ’s processingand implementation procedures.
Through a series of workshops and discussions with the Government, the

Bank prepared a list of recommendations to improve project implemen
tation in Viet Namin certain keyareas such as counterpart fundingfund

release system, procurement and contract administration, and the
Government's approval procedures. Several recommendations have al
ready been implemented by the Government, and the Bank will continue

to monitor the progress. The Bank is also preparing a technical assistance

to strengthen the financial management capacity of the Ministry of Fi

South Asia

South Asia’s economies remained buoyant with an average 4.9 percent
growth in 1997 after an impressive growth of 6.8 percent in 1996. South
Asia’s export growth remained strong, helped by further liberalization of
trade regimes and domestic deregulation, along with an expansion of
market access for the subregion’s textile exports and a slowdown in exports
in the NIEs and the PRC. Largely because of the relative smallness of the
subregion’s financial sectors and limited exposure to external capital flows,
the regional financial crisis had minimal impact on economic performance
in 1997. Strongeconomic growth in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka was mainly
attributable to rebounds in agricultural production. In Bhutan, the increase in GDP growth was predominantly due to a hefty service sector.
In India, growth moderated in 1997 after two years of strong growth due
to slowdown in agriculture and industry. Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan
likewise experienced declines in their GDP growth due to sluggish agriculture and industry sectors. A major challenge facing the economies of
South Asia is the reduction in fiscal deficits to sustainable levels. This
is complicated by low tax elasticity due to weak enforcement and exemptions. Although some long-term measures have been taken to reverse this
position in the intervening period, additional efforts may be required to
curtail the current account deficits.

Economic performance

Economic growth: GDP growth accelerated to 5.7 percent in fiscal year
(FY)1996 97 (ending 30 June), the highest achieved since FY1990 1.
The performance of the agriculture sector was particularly impressive with
a growth rate of 6 percent for the year. This achievement wasattributable
mainly to favorable weather, although the improved availability of agricultural inputs such as seeds, urea, and other fertilizers helped boost
foodgrain production. However, growth in the industry sector was disappointingat 3.6 percent, the lowest in the 1990s. Unresolved supply bottlenecks in
the power sector and sluggish private investment contributed to the weak
performance. The services sector grewby 6.2 percent. The slack in trading
services reflected low imports and reduced industrial activities. The pace of
economic reformsin finance, public enterprise, and trade remained slow. Aid
utilization and reforms in the implementation of the Annual Development
Program remained stagnant. Although stock market capitalization issmall, a
tumultuous boom followed bya drastic bust in the stock market affected
investor confidence negatively. While the fiscal deficit was largely under
control, its financing was a cause for concern. Rapid growth of public borrowing from the limited resources of the banking sector resulted in slow
growth of credit to the private sector.

Inflation: Sufficient food crop production and moderate monetary
expansion kept inflation under control. The inflation rate measured by
the Dhaka Middle Class Index was3.9 percent during FY1996 97. Inflationary pressure, however, built up in the last quarter of FY1996 97 when
food prices started to rise.

External sector: Export growth was buoyant at 13.8 percent, with
merchandise exports at $4.4 billion in FY1996 97. Imports, on the other
hand, grewslowlyat 3.5 percent, mainly due to a decline in food grain
imports. The weak growth of the industry sector and stagnant private
investment also reduced the import demand for rawmaterials and machinery.
Slowimport growth anda surge in workers’ remittances brought down the
current account deficit to 2.7 percent of GDP from 5.2 percent in the
previous year. However, the deterioration in the capital account outweighed
the improvement in the current account. Food and commodityaid decreased
and many project aid disbursements were behind schedule. Net private
capital inflows showed a $120 million deficit, reflecting a large outflow
of foreign portfolio investments. Asa result, foreign exchange reserves fell
belowthree months of import cover at the end of the fiscal year.

Domestic policies On the reform front, the Government has increased
some keyadministered prices which could have a positive impact on the
budget. Reforms in banking and capital market areas have also made some
progress. To improve the country’s international competitiveness, the
Government has been pursuing a more flexible exchange rate policy.
However, progress on structural reforms remains sluggish. There has been
little progress in the restructuring and privatization of SOEs and in the
implementation of trade policy reforms. Following the extreme move-Regional Highlights

 

ments in the stock market, the Government exerted considerable efforts
to developa more efficient capital market. Other concernsinclude issues
of governance, especially public sector management and local government
reform, and the slow pace of aid-related project implementation.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for Bangladesh
focuses on poverty reduction. Ways to create economic opportunities for
the poor and improve their access to basic social services through equitable
and sustainable growth are being emphasized. A significant component
of the Bank’s operations in the country in support of economic growth
ishuman development, particularly of women, through education, and
the provision of employment and income opportunities. The Bank pays
attention to protecting and improving the environment, promoting broadbased and equitable economic growth through greater market orientation
and support, and enhancing private sector partici
 

pation.

 

Policy dialogue: During 1997, extensive policy
dialogue was conducted on issues in a number of
sectors. One major area was the restructuring and
reform of the capital markets in Bangladesh through
a capital market development program loan. The
Bank continued its long-standing dialogue to improve the efficiency of the Bangladesh Railways with
the ultimate objective of corporatization. Increasing
the role of nongovemmment organizations (NGOs) and
beneficiaries in development activities was encouraged
through an innovative approach to deliver basic health
services in urban areas and by promoting microcredit
for rural livestock development. The Bank also pro

vided technical assistance for improving cooperation
between NGOsand the Government, establishinga
regulatory agency in the natural gas sector, and improving the training
of civil servants.

Loans and technical assistance: In 1997, the Bank provided seven
loans amounting to $459.7 million to Bangladesh for six projects in the
agriculture, social infrastructure, transport, and financial sectors, and one
Private sector loan without government guarantee. The Bank also approved
15 technical assistance grants totaling $8.1 million.

Project implementation: Of the 129 loans approved as of end-1997,
90 had been closed and 39 were under administration. Contracts worth
$202.8 million were awarded during the year, bringing the cumulative
total to $3,616.8 million. The contract award ratio for 1997 was 17.9 percent. Disbursements for the year totaled $193 million, bringing cumulative disbursements to $3,683.8 million. The disbursement ratio for 1997
was 16.2 percent. Disbursement performance was adversely affected by
project implementation and procurement delays. Discussions were held
with the Government to address this persistent problem.

Economic performance

Economic growth: Macroeconomic developments in FY1996 97 (ending
30 June) were generally favorable, with real GDP growth increasing to
6.6 percent from 6.1 percent in the previous year. While the agricult ure
and servicessectors maintained their respective average growth rates, industry
sector growth was largely determined by the commissioning of projects
under construction, particularly in the power sector.

Inflation: Monetary growth, which remained at 20 percent in FY1996 /
97, was mainlyattributedtothe increase in reserves resulting from grant aid
and the accumulation of net domestic credit by the private sector. Inflation averaged 7 percent for the fiscal year, largely reflecting price movements in India.

External sector: Exports in FY1996 97, 94 percent of which went to
India, increased by 8.5 percent as the output of recently commissioned
projects was exported. Import growth expanded to 25 percent due to the
construction of major infrastructure projects. Asa result, the current
account deficit deteriorated to 22 percent of GDP. However, with the net
external resource flows from abroad — mainly concessional official loans
and grants — being much larger than the current account deficit, the
overall balance-of-payments position remained strong. Although Bhutan’s
external debt will expand asa result of major projects under construction,
the country’s debt situation will remain comfortable due to the highly
concessional nature of bilateral assistance financing these capital
investments.

Domestic policies: Fiscal policy continued to be prudent. Measures
aimed at encouraging efficiency in the financial sector include:
(i) liberalization of rates for deposits above ngultrum (Nu)5 million;
(ii) introduction of a government securities auction; (iii) the conversion
of Unit Trust of Bhutan to a second commercial bank; and (iv) actions
tostrengthen the legal framework in commercial and business activities.
The Eighth Five-Year Plan (FY1997 98-FY2001 (02) retains the thrust of
the macroeconomic objectives and policy strategy of earlier plans, aiming,
for accelerated growth and improved living standards while ensuring the
preservation of Bhutan’s environment and cultural heritage. While the public
sector continues to dominate the economy, the Government iscommitted to
reducing the state’s role in the commercial sectors of theeconomy.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank seeks to assist Bhutan’s efforts for a
further shift from a subsistence to a more diverse and modern economy,
with emphasis on (i) improving the capacity ofmacroeconomic management
and development administration; (ii) developing infrastructure; and
(iii) protecting the environment. Due to the limited absorptive and debtservicing capacities of the countries, the Bank has limited its lending

12.8 percent. Disbursements during the year amounted to $7.2 million and
brought cumulative disbursementsto $40.9 million. The disbursement ratio
for 1997 was 49.7 percent. Common implementation issues impeding
timely project implementation in nearly all sectors were (i) shortage of
skills, (ii) weak procurement and contracting regulations, (iii) inadequacies in monitoring and coordination, (iv) delays in the recruitment of
consultants, and (v) poor performance of some contractors. Although
disbursement performance exceeded the projection for the year, it is likely
to fall next year unless contractsare awarded on time. The Bank’sassistance

Economic performance

Economic growth: Following two years of strong performance, growth in
the Indian economy moderated in FY1997 98 (ending31 March) to an
estimated 5 percent. A ftera strong recovery in the previous year, agriculture
sector contracted by 2 percent. The delay in the onset of the monsoon
in some areas led to a fall in the area under cultivation and, hence, a
decline in the production of kharif crops, while heavy off-season rainfall

in much of the country in October/November adversely affected rabi
crops. Industry sector growth is also estimated to have slowed down to
6 percent, compared with 7.2 percent in the previous year. The sector’s
performance in both years was well below the 12 percent per annum
growth target set under the Government’s Common Minimum Program.
Continued slow growth in consumer demand, subdued export demand,
and worsening infrastructure constraints were the main factors accounting
for the slowdown in industrial growth, although heightened political
uncertainty, which finally led to the dissolution of Parliament in December 1997, wasalso a factor. Despite the success of the Government's tax
amnesty scheme, the Voluntary Disclosure Income Scheme, the economy,
and especially industry, failed to respond to the budgetary stimulus and
revenues fell short of target. The Government's plans for disinvestment
had to be cut back due to the downturn in global stock markets in the

year were marginally lower than in FY1996 97. In fact, India experienced
net outflows of portfolio investment in November and December as a
result of the worsening Asian financial crisis.

Domestic policies: Fiscal reform, designed to achieve a substantial
reduction in the fiscal deficit while reducing fiscal disincentives, has been
akeycomponent of India’s economic reforms. The Central Govemment’s
1997 98 budget was designed to continue this process while at the same
time giving a strong push to growth, particularly in industry. Besides deep
cutsin direct taxation, the budget also included a range of other measures
designed to boost saving and investment and revive the capital market.
Progress continued to be made in the area of economic reform, although
with heightened political instability which finally led to the dissolution
of Parliament in December, this development was slow. The most important

 

124Regional Highlights

 

reform, announced along with the much-delayed increase in the price of
petroleum products, was the decision to phase out the Administered Price
Mechanism for these products by the year 2000. Asan important step in
this direction, subsidies on diesel, fuel oil, and naph
 

tha (other than for use in fertilizers) were completely
removed, their prices being adjusted monthlyin line
with international prices. At the same time, measures
were taken to clear the arrears owed to oil companies
from the oil pool account. In a significant move to
strengthen fiscal discipline while providing greater autonomy to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the
Govemment announcedin the budget that from April
1997, it would discontinue the use of ad hoc T reasury
Bills. The RBI also outlined a series of measures to
continue the liberalization of the financial sector.
Apart from efforts to give a boost to economic growth,
particularly industry growth, economic management
in 1997 was dominated by concerns over the ex

change rate and, at least by the latter part of the
year, by efforts to limit contagion from the Asian
financial crisis. Monetary policy was eased further in April and October
1997 to encourage credit offtake and boost industry growth. However, in
November, the central bank tightened monetary policy in an effort to ease
pressure on the rupee. Other than the exchange rate, the adverse impact
ofthe crisison the economy hasbeen limited. Given the massive devaluations
that have occurred in Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines,
and Thailand and in order to maintain external competitiveness, some
correction is possibly needed in the rupee’s exchange rate.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for India is to
assist the Government of India to promote employment and reduce poverty
through support for improved efficiency and higher sustainable economic
growth. These objectives are to be accomplished through (i) improving
the supply-side efficiency of the economy; (ii) developing and improving
the policy, institutional, and regulatory framework so as to enhance the
efficiency of public sector operations; (iii) encouraging private sector
investment through an improved incentive framework; and (iv) supportingimproved public resource mobilization and management at the state
level. While support for financial and capital market reforms continues
to be an important area of Bank activities, the Bank is also providing
critical support in the infrastructure sectors. Consistent with the Bank’s
overall strategy, the Bank's operational program is guided by the principle
of selectivity in both sectoral and geographical aspects. At the sector
level, assistance has focused on energy (power and hydrocarbon), transport
(ports, railways, and roads), urban development, and housing finance.
Geographically, state-level operations are under way in two states (Gujarat
and Madhya Pradesh). State-level operations will account for about
50 percent of annual lending in the next few years.

Policy dialogue: Policy dialogue with the Government of India
continued during the year on tax reforms, infrastructure development,
resource mobilization in housing finance, and the establishment of the
Development Finance Corporation. Policy dialogue with the State of Gujarat
also continued with regard to the restructuring of the power sector, including,
tariffadjustment and legislative reform. In preparation for the Madhya Pradesh
Public Resource Management Program Loan, intensive policy dialogue was
initiated with the State Goverment of Madhya Pradesh, the second state the
Bank selected forstate-level operations. The program loan will support structural
reformin Madhya Pradesh and will focus on improving efficiency in the public
sector, including SOEs. It will also seek to promote greater participation of
the private sector in infrastructure development. The Bank hasalso played.
an active role in promoting increased commercialization in the energy, transport, financial, and social infrastructure sectors with a view to improving
efficiency and encouraging increased private sector participation. The activities of policy dialogue were undertaken in close consultation with IMF, W orld
Bank Group, and Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund.

Loans and technical assistance: In 1997, the Bank approved six
loansamounting to $563 million in the housing, energy, ports, and financial
sectors. In addition, the Bank provided ten technical assistance grants
totaling$6.27 million.

Project implementation: Of the 52 loans approved as of end-1997,
16 had been closed and 36 were under administration, including six
waiting to become effective. Contract awards for the year totaled $550.1 million, bringing the cumulative total to $4,074.6 million. The contract
award ratio for 1997 was 17.6 percent. T otal disbursements for the year
amounted to $645 million, with cumulative disbursements reaching
$3,827.7 million. The disbursement ratio for 1997 was 24.6 percent. The
Bank emphasized the need to formulate a project administration strategy
to expedite project implementation and provided assistance to the working group established bythe Govemment to evolve the strategy. The country
portfolio review mission, conducted during the year, identified and discussed
with the Government the reasons for project implementation delays which
include systemic problems across most sectors, both at the policy and
operational levels, and technical problems in individual projects.

Maldives
Economic performance

Economic growth: Preliminaryestimates indicate that GDP growth in 1997
shouldbe approximately6 percent. Higher tourist arrivals and brisk construction activity offset a relatively stable output of the fisheries sector. Construction was mainly related to infrastructure (ports, schools, and hospitals) in the
outlying atolls and the start of construction of new tourist resorts.
Inflation: Inflation in the Maldives is expected to be about 8 percent
for 1997, somewhat higher than the 6.2 percent observed in 1996. TheRegional Highlights

 

increase in the price of fish, caused by the lower catch, was the main
reason behind the increase.

External sector: The trade deficit is estimated to have deteriorated.
to $200 million in 1997, compared with $168 million in 1996. The increase in fish prices partly offset the reduced catch, while higher tourism
receipts compensated for the growth in imports. Asa result, the overall
balance-of-payments position improved. At the end of 1997, international
reserves stood at about four months of imports, despite the repayment of
a balance-of-payments support loan contracted earlier.

Domestic policies: The Maldives continued to pursue a prudent
fiscal policy in 1997, and it is expected that the modest deficit will be
financed through concessional foreign loans, thus eliminating for the
second consecutive year the need to resort to monetary financing from
the Monetary Authority. Over 90 percent of government revenues are
still dependent on import duties and tourism tax receipts, but some diversification is expected in 1998, with the introduction ofa rental income
and business turnover tax. There is also considerable scope for liberalization of the financial sector and, in the medium term, for shifting from
direct to indirect instruments of monetary control, accompanied by conversion of the existing debt of the Monetary Authority into governmentissued bonds.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: T he Bank’sstrategyaims to promote equitable and
sustainable economic growth in the Maldives. To achieve this objective,
the Bank’soperations over the medium term will accord priority to improving,
regional planning and atoll development as well as improving human
development.

Policy dialogue: Policy and institutional matters in the power sector
were the principal areas of dialogue with the Government during 1997.
Bank technical assistance also facilitated dialogue in the areas of legal
development, post-secondary education, and regional development.

Loans and technical assistance: One loan amounting to $7 million
wasapproved during 1997. The Bank also approved four technical assistance
grants amounting to $1.5 million.

Project implementation: Of the seven loans approved as of end1997, four had been closed and three were under administration. Contracts
worth $300,000 were awarded during the year, bringing the cumulative
total to $34 million. The contract award ratio for 1997 was 4.8 percent.
Disbursements amounted to $2.9 million in 1997, with cumulative
disbursements reaching $33.8 million. The disbursement ratio for 1997
was 55.7 percent. Technical assistance was provided to strengthen the
institutional capacity of the Maldives Audit Office, which would help the
Government achieve a greater degree of financial accountability in its
activities, including Bank-financed projects. A country loan and technical
assistance portfolio review was also conducted in joint effort with the
Goverment.

Economic performance

Economic growth: The overall economic performance during
FY1996 97 (ending 15 July) was mixed. While economic growth slowed
down moderately, the external position improved although the trade
deficit continued to widen. The fiscal position also improved marginally.
Real GDP growth in FY1996 97 declined to 4 percent, compared with
5.3 percent in FY1995 6. The slowdown was evident in all sectors, particularly the industry and services sectors. Growth in the agriculture
sector was 4.1 percent, close to the average annual growth rate of the
sector for the past two decades. Industry growth slowed to 3.2 percent
from5.9 percent in FY1995 96 mainly due to a continued decline in the
growth of construction and manufacturing. Limited infrastructure, power
shortages, and lack of skilled human resources are the main obstacles to
further industrial development. The services sector grewby5 percent,
down from 7.9 percent in 1996. This reflected significant slowdown in
finance and real estate, and of community and social services. The overall
budget deficit (including foreign grants) improved slightly from 5.6 percent of GDP in 1996 to 5.3 percent in 1997.

Inflation: Monetary expansion continued to slow down to 10.7 percent, mainly due to the slowdown in accumulation of net domestic assets,
particularly domestic credit to the private sector. Consumer price increases
declined to 7.8 percent in FY1996 97 from 8.1 percent in FY1995 6. This
was largely the result of price changes in food and beverages, which
constitute about 62 percent of the commodity basket, as well as in nonfood and services. The increase in electricity tariffs did not have a significant impact on overall inflation. Due to open-border trading with
India, price developments in Nepal often. closely reflect those in India.
The exchange rate was relatively stable, with a depreciation of about
3 percent against the dollar during FY1996 97, and exerted no inflationary
Pressure on the economy.

External sector. Export growth recovered to 10.3 percent in FY1996/
97. Exports are heavily dependent on two countries, Germany and the
United States, and two products, carpetsand garments. Eamings from carpets
and garments contributed 65 percent of export earningsin FY1996 97. Import
growth increased to 10 percent in FY1996 97, widening the trade deficit to
23 percent of GDP. Significant increases in workers’ remittancesand investment income contributed to the improvement in the service account. Asa
result, the current account deficit was reduced by38 percent to7.2 percent
of GDP in FY1996 97. Inflows of official grantsand concessional aid continued
to finance a substantial portion of the current account deficit. T otal foreign
reservesat mid-July1997 amounted to about $812 million, which was equivalent to six months of imports. The debt-service ratio stood at 8.2 percent of
exports; however, outstandingexternal debt remainedat more than50 percent
ofGDP.

Domestic policies: Despite substantial development efforts and
generous financial support by external agencies, Nepal’s economy has not

and social infrastructure projects, capacity building, human development,
poverty reduction, and natural resource management, particularly
environment protection.

Policy dialogue: Economic liberalization to increase reliance on market
forces and promotion of the private sector were the main focus of the
discussion. To maintain fiscal and macroeconomic stability, the
Government was encouraged to mobilize domestic resources, including streamlining the collection and administration of taxes. The
Government was able to introduce a value-added tax with effect from
November 1997. The Government was also urged to prioritize development expenditure for both ongoing and new projects, and to improve budgeting, release, and reimbursement procedures. Improvements
in the institutional, financial, and technical capacity of implementing
agencies were also emphasized, including the performance of the portfolio
of Bank-assisted projects.

Loans and technical assistance: Only one loan of $27 million was
approved in 1997 to provide for the expansion and improvement of key
facilities at the Tribhuvan International Airport and to assist in the
reform of the civil aviation management. The loan wascofinanced by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund for Intemational
Development with $11 million. Twelve technical assistance grants amounting to $6.32 million were also approved.

Project implementation: Of the 90 loans approved as of end-1997,
63 had been closed and 27 were under implementation. Contract awards

actions to address issues of (i) staffing, (ii) time-consuming administrative
procedures, (iii) the need for improved project coordination and monitoring at the national and project levels, (iv) delays in consultant recruitment, and(v) inadequate counterpart budget allocations. To improve
project implementation further, a technical assistance grant was approved
during the year to strengthen the capacity of the Government's programming,
budgeting, and management of development projects. A country project
implementation and administration seminar was conducted during the
year to familiarize staff of executing agencies and other goverment officials
with the Bank’s policies and procedures on procurement, use of consultants,
and disbursements.

 

 

 

 

Pakistan
Economic performance

Economic growth: Pakistan’s real GDP registered.a growth rate of 3.4 percent for FY1996 97 (ending30 June), compared with 4.2 percent in the
previous year. The slowdown waslargely due to sluggish growth in agriculture
and manufacturing. The agriculture sector registereda growth rate of 0.7 percent in FY1996 97, compared with 5.3 percent in the preceding year.
Manufacturing’s poor performance can be attributed to a fall in cotton production and the impact on industrial output with itsstrong textile component,
lack of credit, slowexportsand outdated production capacity. Investment and
savingsrates remained very lowat 18.4 and11.4 percent of GNP, respectively.
A variety of internal and extemal factors were responsible for the economys
Weak performance as domestic political developmentsand uncertaintiesabout
the availability of external resources complicated the task of sound macroeconomic management. Economic performance also suffered from weaknesses
stemming from infrastructure inadequacies, environmental degradation, and
human resource constraints.

Inflation: Inflationary pressures remained uncomfortably high.
Measured by the CPI, inflation rose from 10.8 percent in FY1995 6 to
11.8 percent in FY1996 97, compared with the target of 9 percent for the
year. The sensitive price indicator, which is more relevant for the cost
of living of the low-income groups, increased even faster by 12.4 percent
in FY1996 97. This was the fourth consecutive year of double-digit inflation
in the country.

External sector: The balance-of-payments position weakened
considerably in FY1996 97. Exports declined by2.7 percent mainly because
excessive rains curtailed cotton production. Persistent inflation, lowRegional Highlights

 

technology, anda shortage of financial resources constrained the recovery

of exports despite the sharp depreciation of the rupee. The rise in capital

goods imports was offset by the decline in imports of food, chemicals, and

metals, resulting in a contraction in imports by5 percent. Increased debt

servicing, reflected in a debt-service ratio of 37 percent, exacerbated the

deficit on the service account which increased the current account deficit

to $4.2 billion or 6.5 percent of GDP in FY1996 97. At the end of June

1997, gross foreign exchange reserves fell to about $1 billion, equivalent

to only four weeks of imports, and total external debt rose to $29 billion.

Moreover, mounting demand pressures and market speculations led to a

sharply widening gap between the official and the free-market exchange

rates, adding to the balance-of-payments difficulties. In October 1997, the

IMF announced a new three-year, $1.56 billion loan agreement. The

agreement helped alleviate some pressure on Pakistan, which was facing Pakistan:

difficulties meeting payments both on its current account deficit and Cumulative Bank Lending

foreign debt obligations. (as of 31 December 1997)
Domestic policies: A strong reaction of the business community to

taxation measures in the FY1996 97 budget adversely affected the economic

and financial conditions, contributing to market uncertainties and slippages

in several areas. To offset the slippages, additional measures, including ee ms ase a04

Operational strategy: The Bank’s current strategy for Pakistan focuses
on human development (including education, health, population welfare,
and water supply and sanitation). High priority is particularly given to
improving the situation of women asbeneficiariesas well as providers of social
services. The Bankalso continues to support economic growth to ensure job
opportunities for a rapidly growing population and to generate the financial
resources for sustained investment in human and physical capital in both the
private and public sectors. Infrastructure bottlenecks in the agriculture,
transport, and energy sectors will be addressed on a priority basis, and
natural resource management remains an important consideration. To underpin the ongoing comprehensive economic reform program of the Government, the Bank also highlights policy-based lendingassistance in keyeconomic
sectors, as well as support in the areas of govemance, economic management,

and public sector restructuring. The Bank’s country operational strategy for
Pakistan will be reviewed and updated in 1998.

Policy dialogue: Extensive policy dialogue was conducted on
macroeconomic reforms, financial management, and aid utilization, in
close coordination with the Bretton W oods institutions and bilateral
donors concerned. On the sectoral level, the focus was on the financial
and trade sectors. The Capital Market Development Program loan, approved in November 1997, includes a number of measures to increase the
mobilization of long-term resources and improve the efficiency of their
allocation through a diversified and efficient capital market. Cross-sectorally,
the main areas of policy interventions included participatory approaches
to beneficiaries and the private sector, cost-recovery mechanisms for operation and maintenance, and domestic resource mobilization, as well as
strengthening management capacities of provincial and local governments. A
dialogue for strengthening the country's legal and judiciary system was also
initiated in the latter part of the year.

Loans and technical assistance: Six loans, including one program
and one technical assistance loan, were approved in 1997 totaling$501 million in the agriculture, financial, and social infrastructure sectors. Fourteen
technical assistance grants amounting to $7.3 million were also approved
during the year.

Project implementation: Of the 179 loans approved as of end-1997,
107 hadbeen closed.and72 were under administration, includingseven yet
tobecome effective. Contract awards during the year amounted to $424.3 million, bringing the cumulative figure to $6,389.3 million. The contract
award ratio for 1997 was 20.2 percent. Disbursements for the year totaled
$451.9 million, with cumulative disbursements reaching $6,327 million.
The disbursement ratio for 1997 was 15.7 percent. The Bank undertook
a country portfolio review during the year to assist the Government in
identifying and resolving project implementation constraints. Timely
implementation of Bank projects has been hampered by a number of
project management, financial, and. procurement constraints. Timelyand
adequate release of counterpart fundsalso remainsa problem. Many issues
raised during the previous country reviews still require urgent action by
the Goverment. A time-bound action plan wasagreed with the Govemment
in resolving problems which will be followed up by missions concerned
with its implementation.

Sri Lanka
Economic performance

Economic growth: Real GDP growth in Sri Lanka recovered to 6.3 percent in 1997, after the slowdown to 3.8 percent in 1996. Rebounds in
agricultural production, tourist arrivals, and manufacturing exports all
contributed to bringing the growth rate back to its 1990s average. The
agriculture sector grewby5.4 percent, following contraction of 4.6 percent in 1996. Manufacturing was the most dynamic sector, growing atRegional Highlights

 

around 9 percent, stimulated by buoyant demand for Sri Lanka’s
manufactured exports, such as garments and rubber goods. Growth in the
services sector was also robust, particularly in the communications, banking and finance, and tourism-related subsectors. The investment rate
improved to 25.8 percent of GDP and domestic savings rate to 16.5 percent of GDP, compared with 24.2 percent and 15.5 percent, respectively,
in 1996. Increased business confidence and the recent decline in interest
rates translated into higher private domestic investment. The reduction
of the budget deficit and the use of privatization proceeds to retire public
debt also stimulated private investment. The country started to diversify
its power supply away from hydroelectric plants to reduce dependence on
weather conditions. Resumption of growth had a positive impact on unemployment, which declined to about 10 percent of the labor force.

Inflation: The inflation rate declined to 9.6 percent in 1997 from.
15.9 percent in 1996. Improved supplies of rice, vegetables, coconut, and
other food crops; a reduction in the fiscal deficit; low increases in the
money supply; and a decline in interest rates all contributed to more
moderate price dynamics.

External sector: Exports grewby approximately 13 percent while
imports expanded bynearly7 percent in 1997. Consumer goods exports,
particularly garments, leather, and rubber products, led export growth.
Agricultural exports also improved, largely due to favorable tea prices and.
increased export volumes of tea and coconut. Investment and intermediate goods dominated imports, followed by consumer products, reflecting
a rebound in consumer demand. T ourist arrivals and earnings as well as
workers’ remittances also registered robust growth, bringing the current
account deficit to 2.1 percent of GDP, compared with 5 percent in 1996.
Improved business confidence, stock market recovery in the first half of
the year, and significant privatization undertaken during 1997 have resulted
innet capital flowstotaling$776 million, resulting in a balance-of- payments
surplus of $362 million and strengthening the international reserves position to approximately five months of imports.

Domestic policies Despite being plagued by prolonged ethnic strife,
there hasbeen continuingimprovement in the economic fundamentals
in Sri Lanka. Commitment to budget discipline and to economic
liberalization, aided by fair weather conditions, led to improved growth,
reduced inflation, anda declining current account deficit in 1997. Sri Lanka
continued on the path of fiscal deficit reduction. The deficit decreased
from 8.9 percent of GDP in 1996 to 4.9 percent in 1997. Privatization
proceeds were used to reduce the amount of public debt outstanding,
sending a positive signal to the markets. Some relaxation of monetary
policy took place at the beginning of the year to support an orderly
reduction in interest rates. Action on large structural items of expenditure
would be necessary to support further the process of fiscal consolidation.
Strengthening the financial sector — through improved accountability
and performance of the two state-owned commercial banks, and more
stringent prudential regulations and banking supervision — should also be
considered in the future.

‘ue Operational strategy: Bank operations in Sri Lanka aim to reduce poverty
tn and unemployment through supporting measures which would raise the
Antal 19934997 level of economic performance and efficiency. The key objectives of the

strategy are to (i) promote sound macroeconomic and sector policies to
improve domestic resource mobilization; (ii) improve the capacityand
efficiency of the public sector; (iii) provide adequate basic infrastructure
to avoid bottlenecks to balanced national development; and (iv) ensure
an appropriate matching of labor force skills to meet market requirements.
Efficiency gains are expected to emerge through supporting public sector
reforms and increasing the scope for private sector participation in the
economy.

Policy dialogue: Policy discussions were a feature of Bank operations
during 1997, particularly in the roads and water sectors. In the roads
sector, agreements were reached on improved operation and maintenance
and institutional arrangements and increased participation of the private
sector in road works in the Southern Province. This model for the efficient management of provincial roads is expected to be extended nationallyin the coming years. In the water sector, a comprehensive dialogue
was undertaken, including water and sewerage tariffs, private participation in the sector, institutional autonomy for water utilities, and operation.
and maintenance. In the energysector, technical assistance was approved
toexamine the main policyand investment issues for the future development
of the sector. In the interim, dialogue was continued on the key issues
of electricity tariffs and the financial performance of public sector electricity
utilities.

Loans and technical assistance: Six loans amounting to $166.6 million were approved during the year in agriculture and natural resources
($36.6 million), social infrastructure ($95 million), transport ($30 million), and financial ($5 million) sectors. The Bank also approved 11 technical assistance grants amounting to about $7 million.

Project implementation: Of the 84 loans approved as of end-1997,
57 had been closed and 27 were under administration, including six yet
to become effective. Contract awards during the year amounted to
$128.9 million, bringing the cumulative total to $1,421.4 million. The
contract award ratio for 1997 was 21.1 percent. Disbursements during the
year amounted to $100.5 million, with cumulative disbursements reaching,
$1,377.7 million. The disbursement ratio for 1997 was 20.8 percent.
Technical assistance was provided to improve the implementation of
Bank projects and an action plan was agreed with government authorities
on measures to streamline portfolio implementation and performance. A
Project implementation and administration seminar wasalso heldin Colombo
to familiarize executing agency staff with the Bank’s loan administration
proceduresand requirements. Specific measures were undertaken to improve
portfolio performance: (i) a project implementation and administration
seminar was held to familiarize staff of executing agencies with the Bank’s
procedures and requirements; (ii) the Bank provided technical assistance
to improve procurement procedures, resultingin the establishment of the
Sri Lanka Tender Support Bureau; and (iii) two workshops were held

Pacific islands

In terms of overall economic performance, 1997 wasa tough year forthe —_g.4.-4o0 Pacific Eeemoaies
Pacific DMCs. Most Pacific DMCs experienced contractions in their real GDP Growth Rares

GDP growth rates, compared with 1996 and five — Fiji, Marshall Islands,

Federated States of Micronesia, Papua NewGuinea, and Solomon Islands
— registered absolute declines in their GDP. Inflation rates in 1997
remained subdued in most Pacific DMCs, reflecting the sluggish economic

performance. In terms of monetary management, the choice of policy
instrumentsis limited for six of the DMCs who have no national monetary
unit. Large trade and current account deficits were a common feature of
the external accounts of the Pacific DMCs in 1997. Sluggish demand for

the commodity exports of Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Vanuatu gener
ated deficits in their current accounts. For Cook Islands, Fiji, Samoa,

Tonga, and Vanuatu, tourism receipts continued to be a principal source

of foreign exchange. In the case of the Marshall Islands and the Federated

States of Micronesia, official transfers from the US continue to be the
main source of external income. The Bank has responded to the deterio
rating economic performance of the Pacific DMCs in the form of financ
ing policy advisory and fiscal and economic management teamsin the case

of the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of
Micronesia, Samoa, T uvalu, and Vanuatu. The Bank has also financed
programs of public sector and economic reform in Cook Islands, Marshall

Islands, and Federated States of Micronesia, which aim at reducing both

the size and the role of government in the economy and fostering private

sector investment and economic development. Ongoing regional analyses
of comparative economic advantage and economic and public sector policy
support these national interventions. Other regional activities supported
by the Bank are in the areas of fisheries, aviation, air transportation,

financial and investment advisory services, and the provision of venture

capital.

 

 

 

 

Cook Islands
Economic performance (growth, inflation, and external sector)

Following contraction at an average annual rate of 5.5 percent during
1995-1996, the level of economic activity in the Cook Islands stabilized
in 1997, with a small positive growth of about 0.5 percent. With the
implementation of an economy-wide restructuring program that included
a sharp reduction in the size of the public sector, the share of public
administration in GDP fell to about 17 percent in 1997, compared with

25 percent in 1994. The shares of the tourism and agriculture sectors in
GDP increased in 1997. Consumer prices in the Cook Islands have shown
little movement over the past three years, with the inflation rate remaining
below 1 percent. This is attributed mainly to stable food and transportation costs. There is a close relationship between price movements in the
Cook Islands and New Zealand, the latter supplying the bulk of the
country’s imports. The country’s external account position continued to
be characterized by a large trade deficit, partially offset by substantial
receipts from the export of services (tourism), aid inflows (both grants and.
soft loans), and some FDI. Merchandise exports, which had been declining, showed signs of recovery, especially with increases in the export of
pearls and papaya.

Domestic policies: Since March 1996, the Government has dealt
with the dual problems ofa serious fiscal crisis and a contracting economy.
A comprehensive Economic Restructuring Program (ERP) isbeingimplemented.
This program embraces measures over the short term to stabilize and improve
the Government's financial operations through expenditure reduction, asset
sales, and the retirement and restructuring of debt; and over the longer term,
to restructure the economy through policyand institutional reforms so as
to facilitate private sector-led growth.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s strategy for the Cook Islands supports
implementation of the ERP. The main focus is on three key areas:
(i) supporting policy, institutional, and economy-wide structural reforms; (ii) enhancing the role of the private sector; and (iii) developing
social and physical infrastructure to promote private sector growth
and the development of the outer islands. In addition, the Bank plays
an active role in donor coordination through the consultative group
process. A Consultative Group meeting for the Cook Islands was held in
July 1997.

Policy dialogue: The Cook Islands’ ERP was formulated and is being
implemented with Bank assistance. The Bank’s ongping policy dialogue
hasbeen within the framework of the ERP, focusing in particular on fiscal
stabilization, including the introduction of institutional and legislative
measures to ensure greater transparency and accountability in the
management of the Government's financial functions. Bank support is
also being extended to facilitate a multilateral process for a possible
restructuring of the country’s official external debt.

Loans and technical assistance: One loan amounting to $800,000 was
approved in 1997 for rehabilitation of areas devastated bya cyclone. One
advisory technical assistance grant amounting to $600,000 was approved
to strengthen the institutional capacity for financial and economic
management.

Project implementation: Of the 11 loans approved as of end-1997,
six had been closed and five were under administration. Contract awards
in 1997 totaled $4 million, with cumulative contracts awarded. totaling
$18.6 million. The contract award ratio was 41.8 percent. Disbursements
during the year amounted to $2.4 million, with total cumulativeRegional Highlights

 

disbursements at $18.9 million. The disbursement ratio for 1997 was
36.6 percent. Project implementation experienced delays which were
attributed to general institutional weakness and shortage in staffing.

Fiji
Economic performance (growth, inflation, and external sector)

The economy of Fiji contracted in 1997 by about 1 percent, compared.
with growth of 3.1 percent in 1996. Money supply growth, which was
above average in 1996, also slowed down in 1997. Domestic credit grew
by about 5 percent while foreign assets declined by about 10 percent.
Consumer prices increased by 2.9 percent during 1997. The trade deficit,
which corresponded to 2.3 percent of GDP in 1996, widened in 1997 due
toa decline in exports of sugar, fish, gold, and timber and an increase
in imports of textiles, machinery, pharmaceuticals, minerals, fuels, and
lubricants, among others.

Domestic policies: The 1997 budget deficit deteriorated to around
9 percent of GDP, exceeding the average annual deficit of 2.4 percent
of GDP forecast for the decade. The Government approved additional
borrowing during 1997, bringing the total borrowing for the amortization
of domestic and external debt, and payment of government services to
about $267 million or 9.2 percent of GDP. While external borrowings
averaged only7 percent of GDP since 1992, domestic borrowing reached
41 percent of GDP in 1997.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for Fiji is to support
the Govemment’s ongping efforts to expand and diversify the economic base,
strengthen the pace of public sector reforms, and develop export-led growth
policies. Key components of the Bank’s program include assistance in policy
formulation, planning, and monitoring and evaluation capacities of central
and keysectoral departments; commercialization and corporatization of public
enterprises; and reorienting policies to focus on the needs of the private sector.

Policy dialogue: Discussions during the year focused on improving
policies and operational capacities in the transport, energy, and environment
sectors; and on capital market development, agricultural diversification,
and corporatizing public entities.

Loans and technical assistance: One sector loan of $40 million was
approved in 1997 for road upgrading. The Bank also approved three
advisory technical assistance grants amounting to $1.57 million for
cost recoveryimprovements ($100,000), safety and traffic management
($70,000), and reform and safety improvements ($1.4 million) of the
road sector.

Project implementation: Of the 13 loans approved as of end-1997,
11 had been closed. Contract awards for the year amounted to $20,000,
bringing the cumulative total to $109.2 million. Disbursements for the
year amounted to $1.8 million and cumulative disbursements reached

Kiribati
Economic performance (growth, inflation, and external sector)

Kiribati maintained economic growth of around 2 percent in 1997, while
inflation rate was around 2 percent. Large trade deficits continued to be a
feature of the economy of Kiribati, although earnings from investments,
fishinglicenses, and.extemnal aid were sufficient to maintain external balances.

Domestic policies The Goverment of Kiribati started implementation
of a national development strategy in 1996 aimed at promoting private
sector investment, including FDI, and improving the Government's efficiency and rationalizing its role in the economy.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s strategy for Kiribati seeks to promote
sustainable growth and improvements in the living standards. The focus
of Bank operations are on (i) strengthening policy and public sector
reforms, with emphasis on improving government resource efficiency and
on the restructuring//eform of public enterprises; (ii) developing social
infrastructure; and (iii) promoting outer island development.

Policy dialogue: With Bank assistance, a comprehensive program
hasbeen prepared for infrastructure improvementsin water supply, sewerage,
and solid waste management. Institutional reforms, designed to improve
operation and maintenance of public utilities, have also been identified.
The Bank's policy dialogue with the Government during the year included.
corporatization of the Public Utilities Board (PUB), and operation and
maintenance of sector assets in an efficient and effective manner. The
corporatization of PUB is suggested as a measure to operate public utilities
with clear responsibility and accountability.

Loans and technical assistance: No loan was approved in 1997. Two
advisory technical assistance grants were approved, totaling $275,000 for
the corporatization plan for PUB ($100,000), and the aerial photography
and mapping of Tarawa ($175,000). The latter is financed by the Australian
Agency for International Development and administered by the Bank.

Project implementation: All of the five loans approved as of end1997 have been closed. No contract awards or disbursements were made
during the year.Regional Highlights

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for the Marshall —
Islands continues to focus on providing policy advice and facilitating Annusd 19934997

donor coordination. The main objective is to assist the Government in
achieving sustainable and self-reliant economic growth in the face of the
termination of the United StatesCompact Assistance after 2001. Structural
constraints are addressed by focusing the technical assistance program.on
improvingmacro and sector policies, strengthening institutional capacities,
and carrying out civil service reforms.

Policy dialogue: The principal areas of the Bank’s policy dialogue
with the Govemment remain concentrated on governance issues to enhance
economic and financial management of the country. The dialogue focused
on public sector reforms, private sector development, and issues relating
to good governance. A policy-based program loan supporting the reforms
was approved during the year, including technical assistance for program
implementation. To support the policy reform program of the Government,
Bankassistance also focused on institutional strengthening of the transport
sector, establishment of the private sector unit, and fisheries management.

Loans and technical assistance: A $12 million loan was approved
in 1997 for the Public Sector Reform Program. During the year, the Bank
continued to provide assistance for capacity building through seven advisory
technical assistance grants amounting to $2.75 million for the development
and strengthening of the transportation, tourism, health, fisheries, and
Private sectors.

Project implementation: Of the seven loans approved at the end of
1997, two had been closed and five were under administration. Contract
awards for the year amounted to $7.6 million, bringing cumulative contract
awards to $23 million. The contract award ratio for 1997 was 33 percent.
Disbursements amounted to $10.1 million, bringing the cumulative total
to $18.2 million. The disbursement ratio for 1997 was 28.6 percent.
Project implementation, in general, suffered from weaknesses in project
management, frequent staff changes, and counterpart fund shortages.

Federated States of Micronesia
Economic performance (growth, inflation, and external sector)

Real output growth was less than 1 percent in 1995, and estimates for
1996 and 1997 are not yet available but are expected to continue at low
ifnot negative levels as the country undertakes a process of significant
structural adjustment. Inflation in 1997 is likely to remain at its 1996 level
of3 percent. The current account deficit, excluding official transfers, has
remained about 50 percent of GDP. The external deficit is substantially
funded by external grants, primarily through the Compact with the United
States. This dependency continues to be a major threat to economic and
social stability.

Domestic policies: The Government is addressing the need fora
restructuring of the economy through the implementation of a Public
Sector Reform Program. The Program, discussed at both national and
state economic summits in 1995 and implemented in 1997, involves tax
increases, reductions in public sector employment and expenditure, and
aims at improving the environment for private sector investment. The
Program includes a new foreign investment law, the elimination of export
taxes, a new tax regime, business training, and examination of means to
improve access to land and to improve operations of the banking and
financial sectors.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for the Federated
States of Micronesia focuses on the need to shift the economy from one
that is dominated and overlycontrolled by the public sector to an economy
that is increasingly sustained bya competitive private sector. The time
for necessary reforms and restructuring is set for 2001 when large fund
transfers from the United States end.

Policy dialogue: Policy reform and policy dialogue continue to be the
major focus of the Bank’s program of assistance to the Federated States
of Micronesia. The core of this dialogue is moving from an emphasis
on fiscal and macroeconomic stability and management to the stimulation of private sector investment, and to public sector prioritization
and reorganization. The Bank is starting to examine and discuss land

This is likely to be an increasingly important component of future
overall development policy. The Bank convened the second Core
Group meeting of the countrysdonorsat the Bank’s30" Annual Meeting

Loans and technical assistance: A program loan amounting to
$18 million was approved in 1997 to promote public sector reforms. Four
advisory technical assistance grantstotaling $2.4 million were approved.

Project Implementation: All three loans approved as of end-1997
are under administration. Contract awards in 1997 totaled $14.9 million,
while disbursements totaled $11.3 million. Cumulative contract awards
and disbursementsamounted to $15.6 million and $11.8 million, respectively.Regional Highlights

 

The contract award ratio for 1997 was 49.4 percent, while the disbursement
ratio was 32.7 percent. Project implementation suffered from weak

Nauru
Economic performance (growth, inflation, and external sector)

Lower phosphate export earnings and lower royalty payments from the
Nauru Phosphate Royalty T rust fund adversely affected Nauru’seconomic
growth in 1997. Consumer spending declined and the countryhad to undergo
structural adjustments to cut budgetary deficits. The inflation rate remained
at single-digit level. Imports continued to decline as the economy remained
on the downturn. The value of exports declined due to the drop in the
production of phosphate and a limited availability of suitable markets,
resulting in a substantial trade deficit.

Domestic policies Nauru introduced measures to augment govemment
revenue and reduce expenditure byabout 50 percent for FY1996 97 (ending
30 June). Significant downsizing in civil service and state corporations
and other policies to reduce government expenditure further are under
consideration.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for Nauru is to
achieve long-run economic and financial sustainability through a reform
program which includesimproved fiscal management, consistent application
of national policies, better public debt and trust fund management, and
restructuring of the public sector.

Policy dialogue: In 1997, the Government of Nauru sought Bank
assistance for a comprehensive reform program. Discussions are under way
regarding the specific measures to achieve macroeconomic stability and
fiscal balance.

Loans and technical assistance: No loan or technical assistance
grant was approved in 1997.

Project implementation: No loans have been approved.

The Papua NewGuinea economy recovered froma contraction of GDP by
4.7 percent in 1995, to growat 3.9 percent in 1996. In 1997, overall GDP
again contracted byan estimated 6.5 percent due to a decline in miningand
petroleum output, exacerbated by the effects of ElNifio-related drought.
During 1997, inflation continued to be subdued, with overall price rises of
about 4 percent on an annualized basis. The current account contracted to

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for Papua New
Guinea focuses on improving living standards through sustainable
employment generation and improved social services. The strategy aims
to strengthen development management; improve governance; promote
employment growth and private sector development; and improve social
conditions. The sectors of focus are agriculture, transport, education,
health, and public sector management.

Policy dialogue: The most pressing issue for policy dialogue in recent
years has been the financing of Papua New Guinea’s fiscal and external
deficits, which was largely met by standbyand quick-disbursing facilities
from the World Bank, IMF, Australia, and Japan. With the easing of the
overall 1994-1995 fiscal crisis, attention has returned to the underlying
weaknesses in development management which hamper effective planning,
andmanagement throughout the economy. The Bank isassisting, in particular, in reforming the Govemment's financial management systems, with a view
to move toward program budgeting, Improving the efficiency of service deliveryand ensuring adequate coverage have been the core of dialogue in both
the health sector andin technical and vocational education, where the Bank
is assisting the Government to develop a policy agenda.

Loans and technical assistance: Three loans totaling $60 million
were approved in 1997 for the Health Sector Development Program
($50 million) and Health Sector Development Project ($10 million). The
Bank also approved five technical assistance grants amounting to $1.12 million, of which two were for preparation of new projects ($300,000) and
three for advisory and operational purposes ($812,000).

Project implementation: Of the 45 loans approved as of end-1997,
36 had been closed and nine were under administration. Contract
awards for the year amounted to about $28.8 million, bringing the
cumulative total to $456.4 million. The contract award ratio for 1997
was 21.3 percent. Total disbursements for the year amounted to
$24.3 million, with cumulative disbursements reaching $448.7 million. The disbursement ratio for 1997 was 15.7 percent. Project
implementation suffered from limited government appropriations and
inadequate staff. Changes in leadership positions and key personnel
disrupted the normal functioning of several government departments.Regional Highlights

 

Samoa
Economic performance (growth, inflation, and external sector)

In 1997, the economy of Samoa grewat a slower pace than the average
8 percent real GDP growth rate achieved in 1995 and 1996 due to the
slower performance of the agriculture and tourism sectors. The inflation rate rose to 8 percent in 1997 from 7 percent in 1996. The
balance of payments in 1995 96 recorded an overall surplus of 1.9 percent of GDP due to a significant increase in the current account
balance, but the Government expected a sharp reduction in the current account balance and an overall deficit of 2.9 percent of GDP in
199697.

Domestic policies: In the wake of a series of natural disasters in
the early 1990s, the Government has adopted a policy of fiscal restraint
and promoted private sector investments to attain sustainable growth. It Samoa:

formulation, planning, and economic management. Only after achieving
some progress in these core areas would the Bank be able to address
longer-term human development and social sector issues and assist in

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for T onga focuses
on strengthening financial and economic management, creatingan enabling
environment for the private sector, and catalyzing development in the
outer islands. These aims are to be achieved through support for public
sector and public enterprise reforms; private sector development, including basic infrastructure; agricultural diversification; and human development.

Policy dialogue: In terms of economic management, the major effort
hasbeen directed at introducing program budgeting within the Govemment.
The newbudgeting system has been designed and is being installed for
application by all Ministries in the coming year. For private sector
development, the Bank will continue to encourage the Government to
simplify regulations on business and to establish effective policies with
respect to the promotion and regulation of foreign investment. Further
progress on the corporatization and privatization of public enterprises will
be pursued. The Bank has also initiated a study in December 1997 on
women in development in T onga to identify appropriate policy directions
and opportunities for advancing women’s welfare.

Loans and technical assistance: No loan was approved in 1997. One
advisory technical assistance grant amounting to $280,000 was approved
to prepare and implement a strategic plan for the Tonga Development
Bank.

Project implementation: Of the 14 loans approved as of end-1997,
ten had been closed and four were under administration. Contract awards
during the year totaled $3 million, bringing the cumulative total to $35.3 million. The contract award ratio for 1997 was 28.5 percent. Disbursements
for the year totaled $2.1 million, with the cumulative total reaching
$31 million. The disbursement ratio for 1997 was 10.8 percent. The
implementation of projects progressed slowly and delays were experienced
at the initial stages, indicating the need to strengthen institutional capacity.

Tuvalu
Economic performance (growth, inflation, and external sector)

Tuvalumaintained growth of around 2 percent in 1997. Inflation remained
very low, reflecting continuing lowrates of price increases in Australia and
New Zealand, the main sources of imports. Export eamingscan finance only
4 percent of imports. Fishing license fees, foreign aid, migrant remittances,

and the eamings from the T uvalu T rust Fund account for the difference and
are sufficient to maintain the external balance.

Domestic policies In April 1997, the Government presented a longterm policystrategy, “Vision 2015.” Emphasis was given to education and
health, good governance, and more equitable income distribution among
the islands.

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for T uvalu aims
at sustainable economic and social development through (i) human
development; (ii) upgrading the transport sector, including interisland
transport; (iii) enhancing private sector development; and (iv) improving
the economic conditions of the outer islands. Assisting the Government
in donor coordination is an important task of the Bank.

Policy dialogue: The dialogue between the Government and the
Bank focused on economic management, international and domesticRegional Highlights

 

transport by sea and air, urban and environmental management, outer

Loans and technical assistance: No loan was approved in 1997. One
technical assistance grant of $100,000 was approved to prepare for anew
project on establishing an investment fund.

Project implementation: Tuvalu became a member of the Bank in
1993. No loans have been provided yet.

Vanuatu
Economic performance (growth, inflation, and external sector)

Economic activity in Vanuatu continued to be dampened by political
instability, which affected investor confidence. Real GDP growth remained
about 3 percent, while real per capita incomes have been falling andthe
overall investment rate declining. Some recovery in agriculture sector
output and increased visitor arrivals were positive factors. Inflation declined
steadily from an average rate of about 4 percent in 1992, reflecting the
falling overseas inflation rates, declining levels of economic activity in
Vanuatu, and the absence of hurricanes during the period. A number of
distortions in the market place, such as import licensing on a range of
essential goods, bear heavily on the level of pricesin the country. During
1997, inflation remained subdued withoverall price increases of 2.5 percent
onan annualized basis. During the first half of 1997, the balance of payments
showed a deficit of vatu (Vt) 439 million, compared with a surplus of
Vt1,018 million achieved in the same period in 1996. Much of this deficit is
reflected in a relatively large reduction in the foreign assets of the Reserve
Bank anda much smaller surplus in commercial bank foreign exchange
holdings. T he capital account recorded a marginal decline of Vt63 million
to June 1997, reflecting a decline in both extemal debt flows (net) and FDI.

Domestic policies During 1997, the Govermment’s financial position
became more precarious with an estimated deficit of Vt1.5 billion. By
mid-1997, the Government had exhausted all its financial reserves and
resorted to borrowing from the Reserve Bank to fund its day-to-day
requirements. Under the Comprehensive Reform Program (CRP), major
policyand institutional reformsare to be undertaken to strengthen financial
and economic management. This will include the introduction of legislation
to ensure the transparent and accountable management of public finances
based on key principles of fiscal responsibility.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The strategic thrust of Bank operationsin Vanuatu
during 1997 was to assist the Government in formulating its CRP. Bank
operations in Vanuatu will assist in the implementation of the CRP. In
particular, the Bank will focus on (i) addressing governance and public
sector reform issues, in coordination with other donors to achieve sustainable,
private sector-led growth; (ii) providing assistance to build institutional
capacity in financial and economic management; (iii) supporting outer

for a strategic plan for the National Bank of Vanuatu.

Project implementation: Of the seven loans provided as of end—
1997, five had been closed and two were under administration. Contract
awards for the year amounted to $980,000, bringing cumulative amount
to $17.2 million. The contract award ratio for 1997 was 10.6 percent.

and Support Activities

Corporate planning

objectives effectively and efficiently, it must be both a planning

anda learning organization. Accordingly, it followsa rolling threeyear planning cycle that is updated each year. In this planning cycle, the
coming year’s work program is firmed up and budgeted in light of the
current year’s results, and the ensuing two years’ work plans and priorities
are mapped out and sharpened. Specifically, each year (i) individual
country assistance plans covering the next three years are developed or
updated in close consultation with government planning and sectoral
ministries; (ii) these are translated into departmental work programs
within the Bank and aggregated into an overall work plan and budget
framework on which informal Board feedback is sought; and (iii) the
administrative budget for the coming year is proposed. The Bank’s planningand programming process is designed to retain the flexibilityrequired
to respondefficiently and adequately to unanticipated development assistance
needs in the region. Such flexibility was successfully exercised in 1997 in
responding to the currencyand financial crises that hit several Asian countries;
despite significant new Bank commitments to the Republic of Korea and
Thailand, the core assistance program of the Bank was maintained.

Asan essential part of its planning process, the Bank continuously
reviews its business practices to increase operational efficiency and development impact. This year, not only operational planningand project preparation and appraisal, but also financial management and administrative
processes, including the Bank’s accounting systems, have been scrutinized
for streamlining and strengthening opportunities. At the same time, both
a stronger performance management system and an accompanying management information system are being introduced in phases, to enable
more systematic performance assessment and improvement, both at the
corporate and individual project levels. This will be supported by the
Bank’s Information Systems Strategy (ISS), which was updated in 1997
and will be implemented at the Bank’s Headquarters and at the resident
and regional missions and representative offices.

These strategic planning and learning processes, most of which are
undertaken by interdepartmental work teams and task forces, continue
to guide gradual changes in staffing plans and organization. An effective
organization structure anda robust but flexible staff-skills mix are considered by Management to be critical success factors for the Bank’s business processes and objectives. Most recently, a business process redesign
has enabled the planning and phased implementation of organizational

basis of howit will effectively support the Bank’s operational strategies.

Economics and Development Resource Center

The Bank’s Economics and Development Resource Center (EDRC)
undertakes and promotes research on key development issues and strengthens analytical awareness of matters of economic relevance to Bank operations.
This primarily translates into (i) undertaking research and analysis on development policy issues and disseminating the findings for the use of developing
member countries(DMCs); (ii) extending operational support byreviewing
the quality of project evaluation and sector work; (iii) providing information
and advice to Management andother Bank staff on economic events,
studies, statistics, and policy debates in the field of development;
(iv) providing statistical information and assistance to DMCsand other
parts of the Bank; and(v) engaging in other resource center activities,
such as the provision of training to DMCs or assistance to other research
organizations.

The EmergingAsia Study was published in the first quarter of the year.
The results of this major study were disseminated in Frankfurt, Manila,
NewDelhi, and Washington, DC. Other studies completed during the
year include the studies on the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-MalaysiaPhilippines East ASEAN Growth Area, and the Emerging T rading Environment. T opics studied during the year included financial flows and
policy issues in DMCs, foreign direct investment and technology transfers
in Asian developing countries, and past trends and future prospects for
Asian exports. Toward the end of the year, a major study on financial
markets was initiated. The objective of this study is to improve understanding of the sources of the recent financial crisis to promote the design
of effective preventive measures. Approval was also obtained for a study
onnewtrade policyinitiatives and their impact on DMCs, tobe implemented
jointly with the Economic and Social Commission forAsia and the Pacific
and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.

Conferences and seminars were held on various economic issues.
These included a panel seminar on “Asia: The Next Thirty Years” held
at the 30 Annual Meeting of the ADB Board of Governors, and the
“Tenth Workshop on Asian Economic Outlook” which examined regional
economic growth. A conference on “The Future of Asia in the World
Economy’ was held jointly with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation.
and Development (OECD) in Paris. An Inaugural Symposium for the
ADB Institute discussed “The Currency Crisis and Beyond.”

In the area of improving economic evaluation and project quality
prior to loan approval, several measures were undertaken. The first biennial review of economic analysis for the following sectors was completed: education, health, water supply, urban development, agriculture
and rural development, transport and communications, and power. Revised
Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects were approved and distributed, and new Guidelines for Economic Analysis of TelecommunicationsCorporate Planning and Support Activities

 

Projects were also approved. An issues paper on the “Economic Analysis
of Health Sector Projects” was completed. W ork began on the Guidelines
for Economic Analysis of Subregional Projects, jointly with Programs Department (West), and on the Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Urban
Development Projects. Under a regional technical assistance, training
workshops for DMC government officials were conducted in Almaty,
Kazakstan; Manila, Philippines; and Hanoi, Viet Nam.

During the year, emphasis was given to strengthening coordination
in data collection and improving data provision to Bank staff and outside
users. More applications to the central statistical database system (SDBS)
were developed. SDBS was made accessible to all Bank staff, including
those in the resident missions. The Bank continued to help strengthen
the statistical capacities of its DMCs. Newstatistical capacity-building
technical assistance projects were started in Bhutan, Nepal, and Philippines.

As part ofits efforts to strengthen institutions and human development
in DMCs, the Bank continued to produce and distribute numerous publications including the Asian Development Outlook, Asian Development
Review, Key Indicators of Developing Asian and Pacific Countries, ADB
Research Bulletin, and the Monograph Series. Issues addressed under the
Monograph Series included, among others, total factor productivity growth
in the newly industrialized economies (NIEs) and Southeast Asian countries; aspects of urban water and sanitation in developing Asia; challenges
for Asia’s trade and environment; the rural-urban transition in Viet Nam; the
experience on adjustment and distribution in India; andsome methodological
problems with recent analyses of the “Asian miracle.” Other notable publications during the year included The Global Trading System and Developing
Asia; East ASEAN Growth Area: Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Philippines; The Bangladesh Economy in Transition; and Investing in Asia
(Proceedings of the Joint ADB-OECD Conference: Second Intemational
Forumon Asian Perspectives) . The Russian language version of Fiscal Transition
in Kazakstan was published.

The Bank also implemented training programs on taxation and international finance for policymakers. The Bank collaborated with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a training program for government officials from South Asia and supported other organizations such as
the Association of Development Research and T raining Institutes of Asia
and the Pacific, and the Colombo Plan. The Bank also served as a resource
center on Asian economic issues for many external organizations from
both the public and private sectors.

Information systems

Toset newdirections for the Bank’s information systems, formulation of
the Information Systems Strategy (ISS) isnear completion. The proposed.
ISS acknowledges the importance of the Bank’s knowledge assets (its
intellectual capital), and the pivotal role that technology plays in the
management of these assets. The ISS (i) recognizes the expanded role of
technology through the entire information management cycle;
(ii) acknowledges that the Bank’s future success is linked to its ability to

become a full participant in the information age; (iii) encourages incorporation of effective information management asa priority for mainstreaming,
Bank thinking and operations; and (iv) anticipates continued evolution
of the external business and information technology environment.

The technical design andimplementation of the ADB Institute infrastructure were initiated and completed within the year. The infrastructure
includes fast networking, PABX with computer telephony, remote computing,
high-speed and color printing, multimedia, and audiovisual facilities, such as
video conferencing, and standardized hardware andsoftware.

The mainframe hardware was successfully replaced with a smaller,
more powerful, and efficient enterprise server. The installation of the new
enterprise server generated savings of about $40,000 in 1997 and is expected to provide a further cost saving of $170,000 annually for the next
three years due to lower maintenance, power, and cooling costs. Modifications have been ongoing to revise mainframe system applications for
century compliance (year 2000). Testing of the Bank’s microcomputers
for year 2000 problems was also completed, and they were determined to
be compliant with the standard workstation software.

The client Server Resident Mission Accounting System was
extended to the Bangladesh and Pakistan resident missions to streamline
the existing manual accounting system process. Project Administration
Committee Notes were extended to the resident missions using groupware,
and software packages were implemented for the investment back-office
system, on-line bank account reconciliation, and digital feed-based financial information distribution system.

The newBanking Transaction Processing System was implemented
in 1997, introducing a major reengineering of the payment processes in
the Bank's T reasuryServices Division. Newclient ferver platform systems
continued to be developed to streamline targeted administrative functions.
On the mainframe, anewsystem was developed to automate the processing
and disbursements of a newsupport scheme for housing, and the Individual
Consultant System (DICON) was redeveloped in groupware.

Major enhancements were made to the following mainframe-based.
system applications: Loan Accounting System to segregate ordinary capital resources and Asian Development Fund processing; Credit Risk Management System to consolidate and monitor the total risk of the Bank
arising from investments, borrowings, and foreign exchange, and incorporation of the revisions of the Bank’s risk-management guidelines; and
Multicurrency Payment Option for payment of a predetermined portion
of staff salary #etirement in home currency. The Technical Assistance
Information System and Staff Consultant System were enhanced to process automatic payment vouchers. The Private Sector System was improved to generate Private Sector Investment Management notes in
groupware. The Property and Materials Management System was enhanced to enable automatic issuance and receipt of standard office supplies by individual Bank units.

Groupware applications continued to be developed for Bankwide and
department-specific needs. The system for tracking documents was extended to additional departments. Databases were created for the Office
of the General Auditor to store and track past and present audits, forCorporate Planning and Support Activities

 

EDRC to store the Economic Analysis of Projects manual, for the Compensation and Benefits Division to store housing information, and for the
Controller's Department to store the Loan Disbursement Handbook. A new
optical character recognition system was implemented for the Office of
the General Counsel.

Resource activities
Library

The Bank’s Library, with a collection of more than 200,000 volumes,
serves as the Bank’s central repository for published information, in print
and electronic format.

The Bank’s operational staff working in 37 DMCs are supported
through a full range of library services. In addition, educational institutions
and individual researchers from around the world make regular use of the
Library's collections and services, through in-person visits or queries over
the Internet. More than 2,800 external visitors were served in 1997.

The Library sponsors an active donation program, extending the shelf
life of items no longer needed by the Bank. More than 2,000 books,
documents, and periodicals were granted to 17 institutionsin the Philippines
in 1997. These materials are nowhelping rebuild libraries destroyed by
Mount Pinatubo’slahar flow, stock library shelves in the country’s Mindanao
region, and serve government agencies.

In 1997, the Library's outreach initiatives broadened with the introduction of an ADB Sourcebook Series and a cross-sectoral exhibit addressing the environmental issues facing Asian megacities.

Public Information Center

The Bank’s Public Information Center (PIC), established in 1996 in line
with the Bank’s Information Policy and Strategy, makes available —
either free of charge or for purchase, depending on the publication — to
the public ADB publications, including information brochures, videos,
and documents covered by the Bank’s Policy on Confidentiality and
Disclosure of Information. The PIC is often the public’s first point of
contact with the Bank. In addition, the PIC is the dispatch point for the
Bank's Depository Library Program, a worldwide network of 106 libraries
where the public has free access to Bank documents and publications.

During 1997, over 3,500 visitors sought the services of the PIC either
in person or through mail, phone, or electronic requests; an estimated
6,500 books and 350 videos were sold; and 1,500 documents were dispatched. In addition, the PIC is the dispatch point for the Bank’s subscription publications, Business Opportunities and Asian Development Review
(ADR). During the year, about 2,500 people maintained subscriptions of
Business Opportunities and nearly 400 maintained subscriptions of ADR.
To serve an even wider audience, Business Opportunities and updated
information about the Bank are included on the ADB web site at
http://www.adb.org.

Asian Development Bank Institute

On 10 December 1997, the Bank inaugurated the Asian Development
Bank Institute in Tokyo, with a symposium entitled “The Currency Crisis
and Beyond.” The Institute is a subsidiary body of the Bank, established
to pursue the following objectives. First, through research, it will help
DMCsidentify development strategies suited to their particular social and
economic circumstances. Second, through capacity-building and training
activities, it will help improve the management capacity of agencies and
organizations in DMCs engaged in development work.

The Institute is expected to carry out two types of activities: research
and capacity building. The first will consist of research on issues with
longer-term and broader development implications and applied research
for identification and distillation of best practices and lessons. In addition
to research projects to be implemented by its research staff, the Institute
will invite external scholars to stay at the Institute, usually for one year
or less, to carry out research projects (Visiting Scholars Program). The
second, capacity-building activities of the Institute, are expected to consist of a customized capacity-building program and a regular training
program. The customized capacity-building program wouldhelp countries
address specific development issues and needs (for example, reforms in
the financial sector and restructuring of public enterprises) through applied research, conferences, workshops, study tours, and training. The
regular training program would provide a generic set of courses required
bydevelopment managers to enhance analytical and management skills.

The Institute will endeavor to reach a broad audience through dissemination of research outcomes, best practices, and lessons, with the
effective use of media and information technology. It will collaborate
closely with other research and training institutes to bring collective
experience and expertise to bear upon a particular issue or subject, or to
expand dissemination of lessons or skills. It will also help national and
regional institutesin the Asian and Pacific region strengthen their capacity.

The Institute is headed bya Dean and will have about 15 international staff recruited from the Bank’s members, to be supported by about
the same number of locally recruited staff. The Dean and core staff
members have been appointed and further recruitment is under way. The
Institute’s Statute stipulates that a seven-member Advisory Council will
be formed to provide guidance on the Institute’s strategic directions. The
Bank’s Board of Directors will exercise the same oversight powers and
functions vis-a-vis the Institute as it does for the Bank, and approve the
Institute's strategies, policies, work program, budget, and annual report.

The costs for the setup and operations of the Institute are financed
by the ADB Institute Special Fund.Administration

Human resource management and development

from 44 of its 56 members. The total comprised 658 profes
sional staff! and 1,298 supporting staff. During the year, there
were 51 appointments and 54 terminations of professional staff, while
67 supporting staffjoined the Bank, and 57 left. The Bank remainscommitted
to increasing the representation of women professional staff in the Bank.
At the end of 1997, the number of women professional staff was 111.

A major focus, started in 1997, is the development of a revised
human resource management information system. The system — which
will be built around an integrated and user-friendly database that will
improve and expand the human resource management services
available to Management and staff— will be implemented between 1998
and the year 2000.

Human resource management activities in 1997 concentrated on the
introduction of individual career advisory services, formulation of a plan
to manage staff performance problems, improvement in skills mix and
competencies for the Bank, implementation of the Sexual Harassment
Policy, and the introduction of noncash incentives as recognition for work
excellence.

Significant initiatives during the year included the Management
Development and Mission Leadership Programs, high-profile training
activities offered to managers as well as mission leaders to enhance leadership and managerial efficiency. Also in late 1997, an Orientation Program
for Developing Member Country (DMC) Officials was conducted to help
participants better understand Bank operations and upgrade their skills
in development planning and project management.

The Bank has continued to provide career development opportunities
and has encouraged participation of staff in short-term external learning
events, including assignments to executing agencies and international
organizations. Study visits have been considered significant opportunities
for staff as they review and learn from past and ongoing project experiences in selected sectors and member countries.

The demand for information technology training has risen significantly
over the past year. With the introduction of newcomputer systems and
software programs, there has been a substantial increase in the number
of training courses and tutorials for upgrading staff proficiency in the use

A T THE ENDof 1997, the Bank hada total staff of 1,956 coming

of these new technologies. Increasing use was also
made of self-instructional resources for information
technology training through computer-based instruction, in-house development of course materials, and
acquisition of commercial products.

Compensation and benefits

The annual review of professional and supporting
staff salaries was completed in July 1997. Based on
the review, the Bank’s professional staff salary structure was increased by4.3 percent and an overall pay

1997, based on individual staff performance. For
headquarters-based supporting staff, the salary structure was increased by
8.3 percent andan 11.4 percent overall pay increase was distributed,
effective 1 April 1997, on the basis of their performance assessments. The
multicurrency and multi-account payment schemes for professional staff
were also implemented on 1 January 1997.

Work processes were streamlined to reduce turnaround time and
enhance client responsiveness. T his included the on-line availability to
staff of information on the various benefits they are receiving and the use
of this system to simulate h ousing, pension, dependencyallowance, insurance, leave, beneficiaries, and other data. Direct assistance to helpprofessional staff find suitable housing was also introduced.

Representative offices and resident
and regional missions

Through its representative offices and resident and regional missions, the
Bank achieves strengthened representation in donor countries and broader
and more direct access to the Bank’s constituencies. To this end, in 1997,
the Bank opened one resident mission in Sri Lanka, and approved the
establishment of two others: Kazakstan and Uzbekistan, both of which
will be inaugurated in 1998.

With these new missions, the Bank will have three representative
offices, ten resident missions, and one regional mission with a total staff
strength of 149 positions, including 36 professional staff and 47 national
officers.

Administrative services

In line with the Bank’s thrust on streamlining business processes, simplification of work procedures, and automation enhancements, several measures
have been adopted to rationalize the Bank’s administrative services and.
enhance cost-effectiveness.Administration

 

The measures undertaken in the administrative area include computerization of various work processes. The Printing Management Information System resulted in increased operational efficiency through the use
of computer systems for planning, scheduling, job tracking, monitoring
staff productivity, and costing. The computerized Travel Request Processing System was developed to enable electronic transmittal of various
travel-related documents for processing. This is expected to speed up
processing of travel documents and improve the efficiency of travel services to Bank staff. Process improvements included on-line sourcing and
document delivery, automation of serials control, and elimination of manual
processes for material circulation. The development of the Shipment
Monitoring System was completed. The system is expected to improve the
quality of services and the control and monitoring of the large number
of shipments of the Bank and its staff. A computerized Vehicle Management System was developed. This provides a database for the Bank’s
vehicles and enables staff to request vehicle bookings electronically.

Budget

Intemal Administrative Expenses (IAE) for 1997 amounted to $190.361 million, an underrun of $9.136 million against the original budget of
$199.497 million. This underrun was realized despite substantial unanticipated expensesarising fromnewinitiatives taken during the year. The IAE
budget for 1998 of $204.817 million (summarized in Appendix7 ), which was
formulated within a framework ofa zro real growth scenario, represents one
of the lowest budget increases in the Bank’s history. Accordingly, the 1998
work program, inclusive of newinitiatives in responding to the financial
sector reform in Asia and implementation of various policy initiatives, will
be realized with greater emphasison resource redeployment, aswell aseconomy
andefficiencymeasures.

Review of financial management systems
and streamlining

The Bank is introducing changes in its financial, administrative, and
operational areas through the use of an information system that will
eventually replace most of the Bank's existing computer application systems. As anticipated, the initiative will take about five to six years to
complete. Asa preparatory step, the accounting and accounting-related
business processes and systems were analyzed. Opportunities for improving,
streamlining, simplifying, and automating the current processes were identified through leveraging information technology. Asa result, an overall
business process framework and concept were formulated, including systems infrastructure, to support a fully integrated system.

In the first phase, it has been proposed that the core financial management (including general ledger, budgeting, and procurement), treasury/
banking, human resources, and project program management systems will

157ANNUAL REPORT 1997

 

158

be replaced. To this end, a request for the acquisition and implementation
of the systems together with the establishment of the necessary hardware
platform, was initiated and was substantially completed in 1997. The new
systems are expected to streamline, automate, and integrate the business
processes in these respective areas, making them more efficient byreducing
staff time and expense.

Internal audit

The Bank’s internal audit function conducts periodic, independent, and
objective appraisals of Bank activities to ascertain the adequacy and
effectiveness of controls, and to identify means of improving economy and
efficiency in the use of resources in carrying out the Bank’s development
mission. The internal audit function reports directly to the President. Its
activities are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

The Bank’s internal audit function undertook initiatives during the
year to improve the cost-effectiveness of its activities through the custonized training of its staff in risk-based auditing and control
self-assessment. It also began a continuing dialogue with sister
organizations, with a major goal of identifying and adopting best
practices in auditing, by conducting study visits and exchange audits. In
addition, it conducted business process reform studies of its own activities
that led to the streamlining of its annual review of the status of outstanding audit recommendations, as well as to the reformulation of the selection criteria and audit approach to be used for its annual auditing of
consulting services contracts. T 0 improve its efficiency and effectiveness
in auditing the Bank’s client-server application systems, it acquired a
proprietary data analysis software tool.

To gain firsthand knowledge of problems and issues confronting the
Bank’s operations in the field, the internal audit function reviewed and
discussed audit-related issues concerming selected Bank projects with officials
of audit and executing agencies. This led to the formulation of more
practical and effective recommendations for the Programs and Projects
Departments, as well asimprovement of the Bank's project administration
policies and procedures. It also allowed the audit function to identify
opportunities for improving accountability for the proper utilization of
loan funds, and for improving project-related financial reporting processes.

The Bank’s internal audit function provided an audit perspective to
a number of Bankwide studies, including the reengineering of business
processes, the development of an information systems strategy, the formulation of an anticorruption policy, the development of a newstaff
performance management system, and the acquisition of new financial
management and human resource management information systems. Its
activities in 1997 included design reviews of newcomputerized systems
to ensure their effectiveness and efficiency, as well as the presence of
adequate controls to protect data integrity and reduce the risk of loss.

Internal audits conducted during 1997 led to recommendations to
improve the Bank’s procedures for administering its technical assistance
projects; enhance the security, effectiveness, and efficiency of a numberAdministration

 

of the Bank’s computerized application systems; institute risk-management
measuresin the Bank's treasury operations; and increase the use of domestic
experts as consultants in the Bank’s loan projects.

Expert consultants supported the internal audit function by conductingin-depth reviews of the Bank’s financial derivative investment operations; the security of the Bank’s internal computer network and of its
Internet connection, and, in continuation of the prior year’s efforts, the
internal controls attendant to business processes Bankwide.

The Bank’s internal audit function participated in the technical
assistance projects provided by the Bank to the Lao PDR and the Maldives
during 1997 to help these DMCs strengthen their governmental audit
function.

The Bank’sinternal audit function also provided integrated assistance
to its outside auditors, Price Waterhouse (International Firm).

T HE BANK'S resources are derived from its ordinary capital rethischapter.

Ordinary capital resources

The funds for the operations of the Bank’sOCR are sourced from paidin capital, reserves, and borrowings. In managing these resources, there
are five financial management and policy concerns: (i) capital resources
management policies, (ii) borrowing policies and strategies, (iii) net income
management policies, (iv) loan products and credit risk policies, and
(v) liquidity policies.

Financial policies: The Bank’s Income and Reserves Policy was
reviewed in 1997. Highlights of the Board-approved recommendations
include the following; (i) adopt a long-term minimum policy objective for
the interest coverage ratio (ICR) of 1.31 which is deemed prudent to
protect the Bank’s risk-bearing capacity, (ii) establish a planning goal of
about 25 percent for the reserve:loan ratio (RLR), and allocate the net
income to surplus when the level of equity capital associated with the
planning goal for the RLR is not sufficient to meet minimum income
requirements resulting from the minimum policy objective for the ICR of
1.31, (iii) effect a medium-term plan to reduce the actual RLR to about
25 percent by 2001; (iv) use the surplus account in the annual income
planning process to protect the Bank’s risk-bearing capacity and, at the
same time, impart flexibility in the disposition of net income, i.e., the
Technical Assistance Special Fund (T ASF) and the Asian Development
Fund (ADF); (v) give priority in the allocation of excess net income on
an annual basis to TASF and then to ADF; (vi) maintain the current
policy on loan charges; (vii) align the composition of currencies in reserves to those of outstanding loans with the alignment substantially
achieved by 2001; and (viii) maintain the Bank’s current policy of funding
liquidity with equity.

Capitalization: As of 31 December 1997, the Bank’s authorized
capital stock amounted to $47,102.2 million (SDR34,909.9 million). The
subscribed capital stock stood at $46,411.5 million (SDR34,398 million).

161ANNUAL REPORT 1997

 

Income and Expenses - Ordinary Capital Resources

 

Performance and allocation of net income

The Bank's decisive income indicators are the ICR andthe RLR. The ICR
is the ratio of net income (before deducting financial expenses on borrowings) to financial expenses on borrowings, and measures the Bank’s
capacity to meet interest obligations on its debts from income. The RLR
isa capital adequacy ratio that measures the Bank’s capacity to generate
net income, and is computed by dividing total reserves by outstanding
loans plus equity investments and the present value of guarantees. Both
the ICR and RLR measure the Bank’s risk-bearing capacity. As of
31 December 1997, the ICR and RLR were 1.55 and 33.6 percent, respectively, compared with 1.7 and 40.6 percent at end-1996.

On the basis of a review of the Bank’s income outlook and
allocation of the 1996 net income, the Board of Directors recommended
to the Board of Governors in March 1997 that the 1996 OCR net income
of $571.6 million, after appropriation of guarantee fees to the Special
Reserve, be allocated as follows: $315 million to the Ordinary Reserve,
and the balance of $256.6 million be retained in the surplus account. The
allocation of net income was approved by the Board of Governors in May
1997 with the adoption of Resolution No. 250.

Income and expenses Gross income decreased by7.2 percent, from
$1,561.7 million in 1996 to$1,449.7 million in 1997, despite relativelyno
change in the Bank’s average operating assets due to a decrease in the
realized rate of return on the investment portfolio. Of the total gross
income, $1,127.9 million was generated by the loan portfolio, $311.7 million by the investment portfolio, and
$10.1 million from other sources. For details, see Income and Expenses — Ordinary

Transfer of OCR surplus to ADF: To augment the ADF nondonor eae a Wee
resources, the Bank and ADF donors considered the possibility of trans- revels Brsoomantitpenbds
fers to ADF from OCR net income and surplus. To enable such transfers,
the Board of Directors confirmed an interpretation of the relevant section
of the Bank’s Charter. Approval by the Board of Governors must nevertheless be given for each transfer. In April 1997, the Board of Directors
recommended to the Board of Govemors that the total amount of $230 million held in the Bank’s OCR surplus (consisting of $70 million from the
1994 net income and $160 million from the 1995 net income) be transferred to ADF. The recommendation was approved by the Board of
Governors under Resolution No. 251 adopted in May 1997.

Lending rates: As a development institution, the Bank aims to
provide funds to its borrowers at the lowest possible cost. The Bank’s
lending rate is basically derived by adding a spread (currently 40 basis
points) to the average cost of borrowings. In addition, a commitment fee
of 0.75 percent per annum is charged on undisbursed portions of the
loans. Currently, the Bank has three lending windows for loans from
OCR. These are (i) the pool-based multicurrency loan window, established in July 1986, where loan disbursements are made in a variety of
currencies of the Bank’s choice; (ii) the pool-based single-currency loan
windowin US dollars, established in July 1992; and (iii) the market-based
loan (MBL) window, established in December 1994, which provides singlecurrency loans to private sector borrowers and to financial intermediaries
in the public sector.

The Bank's pool-based variable lending rates for the first semester of
1997 were 6 percent for multicurrencyloansand 6.79 percent for US dollar
loans. During the second semester of 1997, the lending rate for the
multicurrencyloans remained the same, while the lendingrate for US dollar
loans increased to 6.82 percent.

The lending rates for MBLs are determined on the basis of the sixmonth London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) plusa lending spread. For
Private sector borrowers, the spread is determined on a case-by-case basis,
while for financial intermediaries in the public sector, the spread is the
same as that which applies to pool-based variable-rate loans (currently

on their loans either fixed (at each disbursement) or floating, on the basis
of the six-month LIBOR.

Loans

Loan disbursements and repayments: OCR loan disbursements in 1997
totaled $5,303.7 million, a significant increase of 106.97 percent from
1996, caused mainly by the Bank’s lending activities in the financial sector
programs for the Republic of Korea and Thailand. Principal repayments
for the year were $1,332.7 million, of which $449.3 million represented.
prepayment on loans. On 31 December 1997, cumulative loans outstanding after allowance for possible losses amounted to $18,788.5 million. For
details, see Table 22 in the Statistical Annex.

Status of loans There were 42 OCR loans approved in 1997. About
73.7 percent of cumulative loan approvals were made to three countries,
viz, Republic of Korea, Indonesia, and People’s Republic of China.

Borrowings

The major objectives of the Bank’s borrowing and liability management
strategy are to ensure the availability of long-term funds for lending
operations and to minimize the cost of borrowing for the Bank and its
borrowing members. To achieve these objectives, the Bank seeks to

(i) maintain a borrowing presence in the major capital markets
and, where possible, increase the size of its public bond issues
to provide “benchmark issues” that increase liquidity in the
secondary markets, broaden the distribution of its bonds, and.
favorably align its funding and trading spreads with those of
other supranational borrowers;

(ii) emphasize borrowings in the longer-maturity range (to the extent
that the related borrowing costs remain attractive) to minimize
fluctuations in its lending rates and to ensure a reasonable
maturity relationship between borrowings and loans;

(iii) expand its investor base by borrowing in the private placement

markets of various currencies;

(iv) tapnewmarkets, especially where this will help develop capital
markets in the Asian and Pacific region;

(v) useswapmarkets where cost-efficient arbitrage can significantly
lower the cost of target currencies and transform structured
financing into conventional fixed-rate liabilities; and

(vi) use short-term bridge financing should temporary deficiencies
arise in currencies required for disbursements or debt service,
and if market conditions are not attractive for bond issues with
longer maturities.

Under its borrowing program for 1997 of $2.6 billion approved by the
Board of Directorsat the beginning of the year, the Bank raised fundstotaling
$2,262.7 million through long-term borrowings and $325 million through
Euro-commercial paper (ECP) issuance. The average life of the long-term
borrowingsin 1997 stood at 12.7 years, compared with 9.5 yearsin 1996. Of
the total long-term borrowings, fixed-rate US dollar liabilities amounted to
$2,149.6 million with an average after-swap cost of 6.58 percent, comparedBank Resources and Financial Management

 

with 5.92 percent in 1996. The remaining $113.1 million was raised in
the form of floating-rate liabilities. For more details, see table below.

The Board approved an increase in the 1997 borrowing program by
$3 billion to $5.6 billion in December 1997, when the deteriorating
financial crisis in the region led to the provision of a financial sector
reform program loan by the Bank to the Republic of Korea in the amount
of $4 billion. Following this approval, the Bank expediently raised additional funds in the amount of $3 billion through a combination of bridge
loans from commercial banks and ECP issuance, bringing total borrowings
for 1997 to $5,587.7 million. The Bank’s credit strength and borrowing
presence in the international capital markets contributed to the success
of this large funding transaction.

Ofthe total borrowings, $3,000 million were designated for the program
loan to the Republic of Korea, $2,149.6 million forthe pool-based US dollar
single-currency loan window, $369 million for the market-based loan
window, and the remaining $69.1 million for liability management activity. The cash requirements of the pool-based multicurrency loan window
were adequately covered by cash reflows and, therefore, no borrowings
were necessary for this loan window.

The year’s borrowings were denominated in deutsche mark (DM),
Japanese yen (¥), Swiss francs (SwF), and US dollars. Asin previous years,
global bond issuance continued to be a key strategy of the Bank for
maintaining its market presence in the global institutional investor community. Therefore, the Bank launched its third and largest US dollar
global bond issue in June in the principal amount of $1 billion with a tenyear maturity. In preparation for the third stage of the European Monetary
Union on 1 January 1999, the Bank launched its debut European currency
benchmark bond issue in the principal amount of DM1.5 billion in October.
Based on its pricing, the issue positioned the Bank’s funding spread in
deutsche mark appropriately against comparable issuers in the Euromarket.
With a viewto expanding its investor base, the Bank launched a 30-year,
$300 million put bond issue in August with distribution targeted toward.
US domestic institutional investors. In addition, the Bank entered into
a 25-year, ¥5 billion dual-currency private placement with one of the
major institutional investors in Japan.

As of 31 December 1997, the Bank’s outstanding long-term borrowingsamounted to $14,216.5 million, with an average remaining maturity of
6.36 years, and an average after-swap cost of 6.1 percent while the Bank’s
outstanding short-term borrowings amounted to $3,325 million, with an.
average remaining maturity of 0.42 years, andan average cost of 5.94 percent.

Liquid asset investments: Asof31 December 1997, the Bank's liquid
assets, consisting of investment holdings (net of special reserve investments)
and unrestricted cash, totaled $6,885 million, or approximately 41.9 percent
of undisbursed loan balances. Year-end levels of liquid assets are maintained.
at nolessthan 40 percent of undisbursed loan balances. This helps to ensure
the uninterrupted availability of funds for the Bank’s operations and adds to
flexibility in borrowing activities, especially when borrowings may be temporarily affected by adverse conditions in the capital markets.

The Bank invests its liquid assets with the primary objective of
ensuring the security and liquidity of funds invested. Subject to meeting
this objective, the Bank seeks to maximize income on its investments.
Indeed, the investment portfolio generates a substantial portion of the
Bank’snet income. The Bank actively manages its liquid asset portfolio
within the credit and market-risk parameters outlined under the Investment
Authority approved by the Board. Under this Authority, the Bank is
permitted to invest in the obligations of government and governmentguaranteed entities, engage in securities lending and borrowing, enter into
“short” securities positions, execute transactionsin exchange-traded financial
futures and options, and engage in covered forward investments.

The Bank’sOCR investments increased to $7,041.6 million equivalent
asof31 December 1997 from $6,332 million equivalent a year earlier. TheBank Resources and Financial Management

 

investment portfolio was denominated in 23 currencies. The realized rate
of return on OCR investments in 1997 was 5.2 percent, compared with
5.6 percent in 1996. Holdings of securities remained at approximately
42 percent of the portfolio, while investments in short-dated time deposits
and other banking instruments accounted for 58 percent of the portfolio.
The duration of the portfolio was 10.8 months at end-1997, compared
with 12.6 months at end-1996.

To further streamline the investment operations, a back-office automation system and a digital information delivery system were installed
during1997.

Special funds

The Bank is authorized by its Charter to establish and administer Special
Funds, which currently consist of the Asian Development Fund (ADF),
the Technical Assistance Special Fund (T ASF), the Japan Special Fund
(JSF), andthe ADB Institute Special Fund.

The ADF, whose resources consist mainly of contributions mobilized
under periodic replenishments from the Bank’s members, is designed to
provide loans on cancessional terms to those developing member countries
(DMCs) witha lowper capita grossnational product (GNP) and limited debtrepayment capacity. At the end of 1997, loans from the

 

ADF accounted for 29 percent of cumulative Bank

 

lending, The ADF and T ASF are multilateral sources
of concessional assistance dedicated exclusively to
the needs of the Asian and Pacific region.

The TASF wasestablished to provide technical
assistance on a grant basis to DMCsand for regional
technical assistance activities. TASF resources consist of direct voluntary contributions by member
countries, allocations from the net income of OCR
and from ADF contributions, and revenue from investments and other sources.

The JSF was established in 1988, when the
Government of Japan and the Bank entered into a
financial arrangement whereby the Government of

 

 

 

 

 

Japan agreed to make an initial contribution to the
Fund and the Bank became the administrator. The
purpose of the JSF is to help DMCs restructure their economies and
broaden the scope of opportunities for newinvestments, thereby assisting
in the recycling of funds to DMCs.

The ADB Institute Special Fund became operational in 1997 when
the Government of Japan made an initial contribution to meet the costs
for the setup and operations of the ADB Institute.

framework for the management of ADF resources. Developed in association with the negotiations on the sixth replenishment of the Asian
Development Fund (ADF VII), the new financial planning framework was
derived from lessons learned from implementation of the policies on ADF
income and loan repayments associated with the previous ADF replenishment (ADF VI). This new framework will maximize efficiency in the
use of resources other than donor contributions to the current replenishment to increase the ADF commitment authority. At the same time, it
is an essential component in the implementation of a long-term strategy
for financing ADF that was outlined in the Report prepared by ADF
donors in the course of the ADF VII negotiations (the Donors’ Report).

ADF VII: On completion of their negotiations in T okyo in January
1997, donors recommended $6,300,000,000 (SDR4,299,343,497) as the
level of ADF operations for the four-year period 1997-2000. They also
recommended that initially total new donor contributions amount to
$2,609,837,120 (SDR1,781,045,436) at the average of daily exchange
rates during the first quarter of 1996. In addition, the donors recommended that nondonor resources amount to $3,300,000,000
(SDR2,252,037,069). In March 1997, the Board of Governors adopted
Resolution No. 247 which set out the terms and conditions of the replenishment. ADF VII became effective on 30 September 1997 when the total
amount of unqualified contribution commitments received by the Bank
exceeded the minimum trigger of $1,316,193,560 required by the Resolution.

Bythe end of 1997, ADF VII Instruments of Contribution had been
received from 16 members, including an additional contribution of
$10 million from Indonesia, for a total amount of $2,004 million (at the
Resolution exchange rates). Fifteen of these members, i.e., Australia;
Denmark; Finland; France; Germany, Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan;
Malaysia; Netherlands; New Zealand; Norway; Sweden; Switzerland; and
United Kingdom deposited unqualified Instruments of Contribution. Canada
deposited an Instrument of Contribution containing a qualification, as
permitted by the Resolution, that all installment payments, except the
first, would be subject to budgetary appropriations. Fordetuils, see Table 42
in the Statistical Annex.

The Resolution envisaged that the contributions would become available
to the Bank for operational commitments in four equal tranches over the
four years covered by the replenishment.

ADF VI: The fifth ADF replenishment (ADF VI) was intended to
cover the four years 1992-1995. At the end of the period, a few contribution payments were still outstanding, In addition, as a consequence of
the outstanding payments, some donors had not released the balance of
their contributions to the Bank for operational commitments, as permitted
byResolution No. 214 authorizing the replenishment. At the end of 1997,
$441 million had not been released for operational commitments.

ADF loan approvals, disbursements, and repayments: In 1997,
49 ADF loans were approved, compared with 44 ADF loans approved inBank Resources and Financial Management

 

1996. Total ADF loans amounted to $18,468.5 million, down by1.5 percent, from $18,758.7 million in 1996. The largest borrowers were Pakistan,
Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Disbursements during 1997 totaled $1,154.1 million or 6.5 percent decrease from $1,234.1 million in 1996. At the end
of the year, cumulative disbursements from ADF resources were
$13,135.5 million. Loan repayments during the year amounted to $147.6 million, and cumulative repayments were $1,047.6 million. Asof31 December
1997, ADF loans outstanding amounted to $12,260.5 million, net of
allowance for possible losses in the amount of $5.6 million.

Four loans to Afghanistan and 12 loans to Solomon Islands were in
nonaccrual status as of the end of the year. T otal outstanding loans to
Afghanistan and Solomon Islands amounted to $28 million and $33.4 million, respectively, comprising about 0.5 percent of the total ADF loans
outstanding,

Portfolio position: The ADF investment portfolio at the end of
1997 amounted to $969.1 million, compared with $459.4 million at the
end of 1996. Of the portfolio, about 91 percent was invested in deposits
and other bank instruments in member countries. The remaining amount
was held in securities issued or guaranteed by governments of member
countries. The return on ADF investments over the year was3.9 percent,
compared with 4.2 percent in 1996.

The portfolio was denominated in 18 currencies. Japanese yen and.
US dollars formed 29 percent of the portfolio.

ADF revenue and expenses: In 1997, the excess of ADF revenue
over expenses (net income) was $56.7 million, bringing the accumulated
surplus to $1,067.5 million at the end of the year.

Gross revenue, consisting mainly of revenue from ADF investments
and service fees on ADF loans, amounted to $157 million. Expenses
consist mainly of administration charges payable to OCR of $96.5 million
and provision for losses of $3.8 million.

Technical Assistance Special Fund

Review of activities: There wasno allocation of net income of OCR to
TASF for 1997. During the year, there were four further direct voluntary
contributions to TASF amounting in total to approximately $1,318,000.
Singapore volunteered $1,000,000, its second contribution, and India
offered approximately $126,000, its fifteenth contribution. Both are completely untied and may be used to finance the costs of services and
facilities from all member countries. Pakistan offered its twenty-first partially
tied contribution amounting to approximately $62,000, which will be
made available for procurement from all DMCs. India’s fourteenth partially tied contribution of approximately $130,000, which was offered in
1996, was accepted by the Bank on 24 January 1997.

As of end-1997, total TASF resources amounted to $636.6 million.
Ofthe total TASF resources, $582.6 million had been used Lommitted,
leaving an uncommitted balance of $54 million. For details, see Table 43

Operations and resource position: The T ASF contributed 45 percent of funding for services to member countries, with 162 technical
assistance projects effective during the year. Revenue from investments
decreased from $8.8 million in 1996 to $5.8 million, due mainly to a
decrease in the size of the investment portfolio resulting from a decline
in contributions received during the year, while services to member countries
increased from $55.1 million in 1996 to $58.2 million. Asa result of these,
the uncommitted balances available for future commitments decreased
from $118.1 million in 1996 to $54 million.

At the end of the year, TASF investments stood at $154.4 million,
down 27 percent from 1996. Other assets, comprising dues from banks,
accounts receivable from ADF and contributors, advances to consultants,
and others, totaled $14.8 million. Accounts payable to consultants and.
others amounted to $234,000.

Japan Special Fund

Review of activities: As of 31 December 1997, Japan’s cumulative commitments, since JSF inception on 10 March 1988, amounted to ¥ 72.83 billion
(equivalent to about $633.9 million, excluding translation adjustments).
For details, see Table 44 in the Statistical Annex. The cumulative total
included regular contributions of ¥ 60.6 billion and supplementary contributions of ¥ 12.23 billion.

Of the total contributions received, $442 million had been used as
of31 December 1997 for technical assistance, including organizing symposia fraining and supporting women in development, environment-telated
activities, and activities to promote the private sector. As of 31 December
1997, there were a number of technical assistance projects programs that
had been approved by the Goverment of Japan and the Bank, but which
had not yet become effective. This amounted to $49 million. A further
$44 million had been approved by the Government of Japan and was
being processed by the Bank. The uncommitted balance available for new
commitments was $71 million as of 31 December 1997.

The Government of Japan agreed in November 1997 to allow the
Bank to convert available yen into US dollars prior to disbursement to
address better the mismatch between the available resources and the
US dollar denominated technical assistance. At year-end, a total of
¥20.02 billion (equivalent to $154.91 million) was converted for this
purpose.

Sectoral activities In 1997, the JSF financed 90 percent of the total
project preparatory technical assistance approved by the Bank. The breakdown of the aggregate JSF-funded technical assistance approvals by sector, including those not yet effective in 1997, is shown in the table.

185ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK - ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 1997

(With Comparative Amounts at 31 December 1996)

 

NOTE A — NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND
LIMITATIONS ON LOANS,
GUARANTEES AND EQUITY
INVESTMENTS

Nature of Operations

The Asian Development Bank, a development finance institution, was established in 1966 with its Headquarters in
Manila, Philippines. The Bank and its operations are governed by the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter). Its principal objective is to help
accelerate economic and social development of its developing member countries in the Asian and Pacific region by
providing financial and technical assistance for projects
and programs which will contribute to sustainable economic development and social advancement. As of
31 December 1997, the Bank is owned by 56 member
countries, 40 countries from the region and 16 countries
from outside the region.

Mobilizing financial resources, including cofinancing, is an
integral part of the Bank's operational activities. In addition, the Bank, alone or jointly, administers on behalf of
donors, including members, their agencies and other development institutions, funds restricted for specific uses which
include technical assistance for borrowers as well as for
regional programs.

The Bank’s ordinary operations comprise loans, equity investments and guarantees. It finances its ordinary operations through borrowings, paid-in capital and retained
earnings.

Limitations on Loans, Guarantees and Equity Investments

Article 12, paragraph 1 of the Charter provides that the
total amount outstanding of loans, equity investments and
guarantees made by the Bank shall not exceed the rotal of
the Bank's unimpaired subscribed capital, reserves and
surplus, exclusive of the special reserve. At 31 December
1997, the total of such loans, equity investments and guar
antees aggregated approximately 67.9% (55.6% — 1996) ;
the total subscribed capital, reserves and surplus as defined

Article 12, paragraph 3 of the Charter provides that equi
investments shall not exceed 10% of the unimpaired actu.
ally paid-in capital together with reserves and surplus, exclusive of the special reserve. At 31 December 1997, such
equity investments represented approximately 4.2% (3.9%.
~ 1996) of the paid-in capital, reserves and surplus, as
defined.

NOTE B ~ SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of members are all functional currencies.
The reporting currency is the United States dollar, and the
financial statements are expressed in thousands of current
United States dollars,

Valuation of Capital Stock

The authorized capital stock of the Bank is defined in
Article 4, paragraph | of the Charter “in terms of United
States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on
31 January 1966" (the 1966 dollar) and the value of each
share is defined as 10,000 1966 dollars. The capital stock
had historically been translated into the current United
States dollar (the Bank's unit of account) on the basis of its
par value in terms of gold. From 1973 until 31 March 1978,
the rate arrived at on this basis was $1.20635 per 1966
dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at which time the Second
Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect, currencies
no longer have par values in terms of gold, Pending the
Bank's selection of the appropriate successor to the 1966
dollar, the capital stock has been valued for purposes of
these financial statements in terms of the Special Drawing
Right (SDR) at the value in current United Stares dollars
as computed by the IMF, with each share valued at
SDR10,000.OCR-8

CONTINUED

 

As of 31 December 1997, the value of the SDR in terms of
the current United States dollar was $1.34925 ($1.435201996) giving a value for each share of the Bank's capital
equivalent to $13,492.50 ($14,352.00 — 1996). However,
the Bank could decide to fix the value of each share at
$12,063.50 based on the 31 March 1978 par value of the
United States dollar in terms of gold.

Translation of Currencies

Assets and liabilities are translated from their functional
currencies to the reporting currency generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period.
Income and expense amounts are translated for each semimonthly period generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period; such practice
approximates the application of average rates in effect during
the period. Translation adjustments other than those relating to maintenance of SDR capital values (see Notes I and
J), are charged or credited to “Accumulated translation
adjustments”.

Investments

All investment securities held by the Bank are considered
by management to be available for sale and are reported at
estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from net income and reported in “CAPITAL AND
RESERVES". Estimated fair value generally represents
market value. Cost or amortised cost is used to approximate fair value for certain short-term investments not traded
in the market (time deposits, etc.). Realized gains and
losses are included in income from investments and are
measured by the difference between average cost or amortised cost and the net proceeds of sales.

Loans

The Bank’s loans are made to or guaranteed by members or
their governments, with the exception of loans to the private sector, and have maturities ranging between 7 and 30
years. The Bank requires its borrowers to absorb exchange

risks attributable to fluctuations in the value of the currencies which it has disbursed. It is the policy of the Bank to
place in non-accrual status all loans for which principal,
interest or other charges are overdue by six months. When
loans are placed in non-accrual status, the related unpaid
interest and other charges are reversed and are deducted
from loan interest income and other charges, as appropriate. Interest and other charges on non-accruing loans are
included in income only to the extent that payments have
actually been received by the Bank. The Bank follows a
policy of nor taking part in debt rescheduling agreements.

The Bank determines that a loan is impaired and therefore
subject to provisioning when principal or interest is in
arrears for one year for public sector loans made to or
guaranteed by a member (unless there is clear and convineing evidence warranting the deferment or acceleration of
such provisioning) and six months for private sector loans.
If the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate is less than the
carrying value of the loan, a specific valuation allowance is
established with a corresponding charge to provision for
losses. In addition, the Bank establishes a general loan loss
allowance for private sector loan portfolio based on a rate

approved by the Board of Directors.

The Bank's periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the
general loan loss reserve factors and overall allowance for
possible losses is based on its past loan loss experience,
known and inherent risks in existing loans and commitments to extend credit and adverse situations that may
affect a borrower's ability to repay.

Equity Investments

Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are reported at cost less an allowance for
possible losses. The provisions for possible loss of value are
established quarterly based on Management's evaluation of
potential losses for such investments. Equity securities with
readily determinable fair values are reported at fair value,
with unrealized gains and losses excluded from net income

and reported in “CAPITAL AND RESERVES”. The Bank
applies the equity method of accounting to one investment
where it has the ability to exercise significant influence.

Property, Furniture and Equipment

Property, furniture and equipment is stated at cost and,
except for land, is depreciated over estimated useful lives
on the straight-line method. Maintenance, repairs and minor
betterments are charged to expense.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of the year and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
year. The actual results could differ from those estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Bank
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS". Certain amounts in the 1996 statement of cash flows have been reclassified to conform to the
1997 presentation.

NOTE C - RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF
CURRENCIES AND DEMAND
OBLIGATIONS OF MEMBERS

In accordance with Article 24, paragraph 2(i) of the Charter,’

the use by the Bank or by any recipient from the Bank of

for goods or services produced and intended for use in their
territories. With respect to the currencies of 36 developing
member countries for both 1997 and 1996, cash in banks (due
from banks) and demand obligations totalling $53,359,000
($59,879,000 — 1996) and $213,054,000 ($249,966,000 —
1996), respectively, may be, but are not currently so restricted.

In accordance with Article 24, paragraphs 2(i) and (ii) of
the Charter, two members have restricted the use by the
Bank or by any recipient from the Bank of their currencies
to payments for goods or services produced in their territories. Cash in banks (due from banks), demand obligations

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors. The main investment
management objective is to maintain security and liquidity.
Subject to these parameters, the Bank seeks the highest
possible return on its investments.

To reduce credit risk, the Bank is restricted by its Investment Authority to invest in (a) securities which are obligations of limited class of issuers, primarily government or
government-guaranteed obligations, multilateral banks and
selected commercial banks; and (b) exchange-traded derivatives of such securities. Exposure to interest rate risk may
be adjusted within defined bands to reflect changing market
circumstances, These adjustments are made through the
purchase and sale of both securities and exchange-traded
financial futures and options. The use of options has been
minimal and there were no outstanding options as of
31 December 1997 (nil — 1996). To increase returns, the
Bank may invest in securities denominated in currencies
other than the original functional currencies and then enter
into covered forward foreign exchange agreements in order to
maintain its original mix of functional currency holdings.
Accondingly, the financial futures, options and covered forwards
are held for risk management rather than trading purposes.

Futures: Futures are contracts for delayed delivery of securities or money market instruments in which the seller
agrees to make delivery at a specified future date of a
specified instrument at a specified price or yield. Initial
margin requirements are met with cash or securities, and
changes in the market prices are settled daily. Changes in
the marker value of open futures contracts are recognized
as gains or losses in the period of the change and included
in income from investments. Outstanding futures contracts
at 31 December 1997 include purchase contracts with
notional value of $9,664,000 (nil — 1996) and sales contracts with notional value of $9,477,000 (nil — 1996). All
contracts expire in 1998.

Covered forwards: Covered forwards are agreements in
which cash in one currency is converted into a different
currency and simultaneously a forward exchange agreement is executed providing for a future exchange of the nvo
currencies in order to recover the currency converted, The
Bank records the covered forward as an investment in the
underlying currency. A receivable is created for the forward
contract of the originating currency and a payable for the
underlying instrument to be converted into the originating
currency at maturity. Premiums or discounts are deferred
and amortised as income from investments over the life of
the underlying instrument. No covered forward agreements
were outstanding at 31 December 1997 (nil -1996).

Short sales: Short sales are sales of securities not held in
the Bank's portfolio at the time of the sale. The Bank must
purchase the security at a later date and bears the risk that
the market value of the security will move adversely between the time of the sale and the time the security must
be’ delivered. The payable created upon entering into a
short sale is stated at the market value of the secutity
subject to the short sale and gains and losses resulting from
changes in market value are included in income from investments in the period of the change. Short sales are used
by the Bank for adjusting the risk exposure of the investment portfolio and for establishing spread positions to enhance income, As of 31 December 1997, there was no open
short sale position (nil — 1996).

Prior to 1 July 1986, the lending rate of the Bank was based
on a multicurrency fixed lending rate system under which
loans carried interest rates fixed at the time of loan approval for the entire life of the loans. Effective 1 July 1986, —
the Bank adopted a multicurrency pool-based variable lending rate system. In addition, in July 1992, the Bank introduced a pool-based variable United States dollar lending
system, and in November 1994, a market-based variable
lending system was made available to financial intermediaries in the public sector and to the private sector. For
loans to the private sector, approximately 68% (64% —
1996) of the loans were based on variable interest rate.

Undisbursed loan commitments and an analysis of loans by
borrowing member countries as of 31 December 1997 and
1996 are shown in OCR-5.

Public Sector Loans

Loans outstanding to or guaranteed by members or their
governments with interest rates which vary based on the
pool-based variable lending rate system were fair valued
using an entry value method. Under this method, fair value
was determined based on the terms at which a similar loan
would currently be made by the Bank to a similar borrower.
Forsuch loans, fair value approximated the carrying amount.
For undisbursed balances of effective loans and for loans
not yet effective, the contractual amount approximated

fair value.

Loans outstanding to or guaranteed by members or their
governments with fixed interest rates (principally loans
made prior to | July 1986) were fair valued using a discounted cash flow method. This method takes into account
the scheduled cash flows over the average life, by currency,
of the loans, and current funding costs for the average life
including a factor for administrative costs. The effect of
expected prepayments are also taken into account.

The estimated fair value of loans to or guaranteed by members or their governments was not affected by credit risks
based on the Bank's experience with its borrowers.

 

190OCR-8

 

As of 31 December 1997 and 1996, there were no public
sector loans in non-accrual status,

Private Sector Loans

Loans outstanding to the private sector were fair valued
using a discounted cash flow method. The estimated fair
value of these loans was $343,590,000 ($349,615,000 1996).

Six private sector loans were placed in non-accrual status
as of 31 December 1997 (three - 1996), The principal
outstanding at thar date was $41,002,000 ($19,899,000 —
1996) of which $12,062,000 ($5,976,000 — 1996) was overdue. Overdue interest and other charges on these loans
totalled $8,376,000 ($4,832,000 — 1996). Placing these
loans in non-accrual status resulted in a reduction of
$4,464,000 ($1,415,000 — 1996) in income from loans for
the year ended 31 December 1997.

Loan Loss Provision

The Bank has not suffered any losses on loans made to or
guaranteed by members or their governments. No loan loss
provisions have been made against loans outstanding guaranteed by members or their governments, but specific and
general provisions were made against private sector loans
during the year. (See Note K.)

NOTE H - BORROWINGS AND SWAPS

The Bank uses derivative financial instruments in connection with its borrowing activities to diversify its funding
sources across public and private debt markets, currencies and instruments. Currency swaps are used to convert a currency borrowed under advantageous terms into
one of the Bank’s major operational currencies, taking
advantage of the opportunities offered in different financial markets. Such currency swaps enable the Bank
to raise operationally needed currencies in a cost-efficient way and to maintain its borrowing presence in the
major capital markets. Interest rate swaps are used generally to reduce balance sheet interest rate mismatches
arising from lending operations.

The Bank issues structured debt which includes embedded
currency and/or interest rate derivatives in order to decrease its cost of borrowing. However, the Bank enters into
simultaneous currency and/or interest rate swaps to fully
hedge against the effects of such embedded derivatives.

The Bank has a potential risk of loss if the swap counterparty
fails to perform its obligations (see Note P). In order to
reduce such credit risk, the Bank normally only enters into
long-term swap transactions with counterparties eligible
under the Bank's swap guidelines which includes a requirement that the counterparties have a credit rating of double
A or higher. The Bank does not anticipate that any of its
counterparties will fail to perform their obligations under
such agreements.

Interest rate swaps: Under a typical interest rate swap
agreement used by the Bank, one party agrees to make
periodic payments based on a notional principal amount
and an interest rate thar is fixed at the outset of the
agreement. The counterparty agrees to make floating rate
payments based on the same notional principal amount.
Amounts receivable or payable under the terms of the swap
are accrued over the period to which the payment relates
and the related cost or income is included in interest and
other financial expenses. The terms of the Bank's interest

rate swap agreements specifically match the terms of particular borrowings.

Currency swaps: Under a typical currency swap agreement, one party agrees to make periodic payments in one
currency while the counterparty agrees to make periodic
payments in another currency. The payments may be fixed
at the outset of the agreement or vary based on interest
rates. A receivable is created for the periodic payments to
be received and a payable is created for the payments to be
made. Swap premiums and discounts are deferred and
amortised into interest and other financial expenses over
the life of the underlying instruments, The terms of the
Bank's currency swap agreements specifically match the
terms of particular borrowings.

The fair value of borrowings outstanding is estimated using
prevailing market prices where available, or estimated replacement values where market prices were not available.

Outstanding currency and interest rate swap agreements
are fair valued at the estimated amount that the Bank
would receive or pay to terminate the agreements based
upon market quotes from dealers.

As of 31 December 1997 and 31 December 1996, the
carrying amounts and estimated fair values of borrowings
and swaps were as follows:

The authorized capital stock of the Bank as of the end Y
1997 and 1996 consists of 3,490,994 shares, of whic
3,439,799 shares have been subscribed by members. Of the
subscribed shares, 3,197,866 are “callable” and 241,933 are
“paid-in” for the years ended 31 December 1997 ani
31 December 1996. The “callable” share capital is subject
to call by the Bank only as and when required to meet
Bank's obligations incurred on borrowings of funds for inclusion in its ordinary capital resources or on guarantees
chargeable to such resources. The “paid-in” share capital
has been paid or is payable in instalments, partly in con-_
vertihle currencies and partly in the currency of the subscribing member which may be convertible. In accordance
with Article 6, paragraph 3 of the Charter, the Bank accepts non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing demand obligations in satisfaction of the portion payable in the currency
of the member, provided such currency is not required by
the Bank for the conduct of its operations. The settlement
of such amounts is not determinable and, accordingly, it is
not practicable to fair value these receivables.

As of 31 December 1997, all matured instalments amounting to $2,191,719,000 ($3,090,050,000 — 1996) were received except for $3,372,000 ($2,107,000 — 1996),

Capital Transferred to Asian Development Froud

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1 (i) of
the Charter, the Board of Governors has authorized the
setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired “paid-in” capital
paid by members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(a) of
the Charter and of the convertible currency portion paid by
members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(b) of the Charter
as of 28 April 1973 to be used as a part of the Special Funds
of the Bank. The resources so set aside amounting to
$64,237,000 as of 31 December 1997 ($68,329,000 — 1996)
expressed in terms of the SDR on the basis of $1.34925
($1.43520 -— 1996) per SDR ($57,434,000 in terms of
$1.20635 per 1966 dollar —see Note B), were allocated and
transferred to the Asian Development Fund.

Maintenance of Value of Currency Holdings

Prior to 1 April 1978, the effective date of the Second
Amendment to the IMF Articles, the Bank implemented
maintenance of value in respect of holdings of member
currencies in terms of 1966 dollars, in accordance with the
provisions of Article 25 of the Charter and relevant resolutions of the Board of Directors, The “Amounts required
to maintain value of currency holdings” under "RECEIVABLE FROM MEMBERS" represent the aggregate amounts
receivable resulting from changes in exchange rates of
member currencies from those previously used for the purpose of computing maintenance of value of the Bank’s
holdings of certain member currencies. The settlement of
such amounts is not determinable and, accordingly, it is
not practicable to fair value these receivables.

Since | April 1978, inasmuch as the valuation of the Bank's
capital stock and the basis of determining possible maintenance of value obligations are still under consideration,

notional amounts have been calculated provisionally as
receivable from or payable to members in order to maintain
the value of currency holdings in terms of the SDR. The
timing of any establishment and settlement of such amounts
is uncertain and, accordingly, it is not practicable to fair
value such receivables and payables. The notional amounts
as of 31 December 1997 consisting of receivables of
$627,349,000 ($605,000,000 - 1996) and payables of
$177,294,000 ($243,882,000 — 1996) consist of (a) the
increase of $307,089,000 ($458, 167,000 — 1996) in amounts
required to maintain the value of currency holdings to the
extent of matured and paid capital subscriptions due to the
increase in the value of the SDR in relation to the United
States dollar during the period from 1 April 1978 to
31 December 1997 and (b) the net decrease of $142,966,000
(net increase of $97,049,000 — 1996) in the value of such
currency holdings in relation to the United States dollar
during the same period.

NOTE J - ORDINARY RESERVE AND NET
INCOME, SPECIAL RESERVE AND
SURPLUS

Ordinary Reserve and Net Income

Under the provisions of Article 40 of the Charter, the Board
of Governors shall determine annually what part of the net
income shall be allocated, after making provision for reserves,
to surplus and what part, if any, shall be distributed to the
members. During 1997, $315,000,000 ($500,045,000— 1996)
of the net income after appropriation of guarantee fees to
Special Reserve for the year ended 31 December 1996 was
allocated ro the Ordinary Reserve, and $256,645,000
($160,000,000 — 1996) was allocated to Surplus.

The restatement of the capital stock for purposes of these
financial statements on the basis of the SDR instead of the
1966 dollar (see Note B) resulted in a net credit of
$29,752,000 to the Ordinary Reserve during the year ended
31 December 1997 ($19,358,000 — 1996). That credit is

Special Reserve

The Special Reserve represents commissions on loans and
guarantee fees on guarantees set aside pursuant to Article
17 of the Charter. Special Reserve assets consist principally
of government and government-guaranteed obligations and
are included under the heading “INVESTMENTS”. For
the year ended 31 December 1997, guarantee fees amounting to $416,000 ($441,000 — 1996) were appropriated to
Special Reserve. The commission charged on loans was
discontinued in 1986.

Surplus

During 1997, the Board of Governors allocated $256,645,000
($160,000,000— 1996) out of 1996 net income after appropriation of guarantee fees to the Special Reserve to surplus
of which $230,000,000 was subsequently reallocated and
transferred to Asian Development Fund. Surplus represents funds for future use to be determined by the Board of
Governors.

NOTE K — INCOME AND EXPENSES

Total income from loans for the year ended 31 December
1997 was $1,127,856,000 ($1,169,979,000 — 1996). The

the beginning and end of each month, excluding unrealized
gains and losses, was 5.24% (5.59% — 1996). If unrealized
gains and losses were included, the annualized rate of return would have been 5.08% (5.55% — 1996).

NOTE M — STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN

The Bank has a contributory defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (the Plan). Every employee, as defined under
the Plan, shall, as a condition of service, become a participant as of the first day of service, provided that as of such
a date, the employee shall not have reached the normal
retirement date at age 60. The Plan applies also to members
of the Board of Directors who elect to join the Plan. Retirement benefits are based on length of service and highest
average remuneration during two years of eligible service.
The Plan assets are segregated and are not included in the
accompanying balance sheet. The costs of administering
the Plan are absorbed by the Bank, except for fees paid to
the investment managers and related charges, including
custodian fees, which are borne by the Plan,

Participants are required to contribute 9 1/3% of their
remuneration to the Plan and may also make voluntary
contributions. The Bank’s contribution is determined at a
rate sufficient to cover that part of the costs of the Plan not
covered by the participants’ contributions.

Net periodic pension cost for the years ended 31 December
1997 and 31 December 1996, which have been included in
administrative expenses for the respective years, consisted

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1997
(With Comparative Amounts at 31 December 1996)

 

The discount rate used in determining the actuarial present
value of the projected benefit obligation was 7% (7.50% =
1996), The effect of projected compensation levels was
calculated based on a scale that provides for a decreasing
rate of salary increase depending on age; beginning with
13% (13.50% — 1996) at age 21 and decreasing to 4.5%
(5.00% — 1996) at age 59, The expected long-term rate of
return on assets was 8% for both 1997 and 1996,

NOTE N ~ POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL
BENEFITS PLAN

In 1993, the Bank adopted a cost-sharing plan for retirees
medical insurance premiums. Under the plan, the Bank is
obligated to pay 80% of the Group Medical Insurance Plan
premiums for retirees, including retired members of the
Board of Directors, and their eligible dependents who elected
to participate. The cost-sharing plan is currently unfunded.

Generally accepted accounting principles require an actuarially determined assessment of the periodic cost of
postretirement medical benefits. Net periodic postretirement
medical benefit cost for the years ended 31 December 1997
and 31 December 1996, which have been included in administrative expenses for the respective years, consisted of
the following components:

 

 

1997 1996

Service costs-benefits

eamed for the year $1,354,000 $3,357,000
Interest cost on accumulated

The accumulated postretirement medical benefit obligation was determined using medical cost trend rate of 12%
for 1998 grading down to 4% in 2009 (7.5% — 1996).
Increasing the medical cost trend rate by 1% would increase the accumulated postretirement medical benefit
obligation as of 31 December 1997 by $9,639,000
($7,204,600 — 1996) and the net periodic postretirement
benefit cost by $2,148,000 ($776,000 — 1996) for the year
then ended. The weighted average discount rate used in
determining the accumulated postretirement medical benefit obligation was 7% (7.5% — 1996).

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1997
(With Comparative Amounts at 31 December 1996)

Additional fair value information, including methods used
to estimate certain values, is included in the notes referenced in the above table.

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily require the use of
subjective judgments, Accordingly, the actual value at which
such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current
transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not determinable.

NOTE P — OFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT RISK

The Bank is a party to off-balance sheet financial instruments. These financial instruments involve elements of
credit risk in excess of amounts reflected on the balance
sheet. Credit risk represents the maximum potential accounting loss due to possible nonperformance by obligors
and counterparties under the terms of the contract.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1997
(With Comparative Amounts at 31 December 1996)

CONTINUED

 

NOTE A — NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Asian Development Fund (the Fund) was established
on 28 June 1974 to carry out more effectively the special
operations of the Bank by providing resources on
concessional terms which are made available almost exclusively to the poorest borrowing countries.

The resources of the Fund have been subsequently augmented by six replenishments, the most recent of which
became effective in September 1997 in a cotal amount
equivalent to US$2,657,777,000 to cover the operational
requirements for the four-year period from January 1997.
In 1997, unallocated net income in the amount of
$230,000,000 held in the surplus account of the Bank's
ordinary capital resources was allocated to the Fund to
supplement donors’ contributions.

NOTE B — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currencies anil Reporting Currency

The currencies of contributing members are functional
currencies. The reporting currency is the United States
dollar, and the financial statements are expressed in thousands of current United States dollars.

Translation of Crrrencies

Assets, liabilities, amounts available for loan commitments
and advance payments on contributions are translated from
their functional currencies to the reporting currency generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a
reporting period. Revenue and expense amounts are translated for each semi-monthly period generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period;
such practice approximates the application of average rates
in effect during the period. Translation adjustments relating to set-aside resources (see Note G) are recorded as
notional amounts receivable from or payable to Ordinary
Capital Resources. Other translation adjustments are

charged or credited to “Accumulated translation adjustments”, Exchange gains or losses on currency transactions
among functional currencies are included in revenue.

Investments

All investment securities held by the Bank are considered
by management to be available for sale and are reported at
estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from revenue and reported in “UNEXPENDED
BALANCES AND CAPITAL". Estimated fair value generally represents market value. Cost or amortised cost is
used to approximate fair value for certain short-term investments not traded in the marker (time deposits, etc.).
Realized gains and losses are included in revenue from
investments and are measured by the difference between
average cost or amortised cost and the net proceeds of sales.

Loans

Loans of the Fund are extended to eligible developing
member countries, bear only a service charge and require
repayment over periods ranging from 35 to 40 years, The
Fund requires borrowers to absorb exchange risks attributable to fluctuations in the value of the currencies disbursed. It is the policy of the Fund to place in non-accrual
status all loans made to eligible developing member countries if the principal or service charges with respect to any
such loan are overdue by six months. When loans are
placed in non-accrual status, the related unpaid service
charges are reversed and are deducted from revenue. Service charges on non-accruing loans are included in revenue only to the extent that payments have actually been
received by the Fund. The Bank follows a policy of not
taking part in debt rescheduling agreements.

The Bank determines that a loan is impaired and therefore
subject to provisioning when principal or interest is in
arrears for one year for public sector loans made to or
guaranteed by a member (unless there is clear and convineing evidence warranting the deferment or acceleration of
such provisioning) and six months for private sector loans.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1997
(With Comparative Amounts at 31 December 1996)

 

a

If the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate is less than the
carrying value of the loan, a specific valuation allowance is
established with a corresponding charge to provision for
losses. In addition, the Bank establishes a general loan loss
allowance for private sector loan portfolio based on a rate
approved by the Board of Directors.

The Bank's periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the
general loan loss reserve factors and overall allowance for
possible losses is based on its past loan loss experience,
known and inherent risks in existing loans and commitments to extend credit and adverse situations that may
affect a borrower's ability to repay.

Contributed Resources

Contributions by members are included in the financial
statements as amounts committed from the date Instruments of Contribution are deposited and related formalities are completed.

Contributions are generally paid or to be paid in the currency of the contributor either in cash or notes.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of
the year and the reported amounts of income and expenses
during the year. The actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Fund

considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS”.

Gross losses 1,000 192,000

The annualized rate of return on the average investments
held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the
beginning and end of each month, excluding unrealized
gains and losses, was 3.93% (4.23% — 1996). If unrealized
gains and losses were included, the annualized rate of return would have been 3.94% (4.06% — 1996),

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors. The main investment
management objective is to maintain security and liquidity. Subject to these parameters, the Bank seeks the highest
possible return on its investments.

NOTE D - LOANS AND LOAN LOSS
PROVISION

Loans
Loans are fair valued using an entry value method. Under

this method, fair value is determined based on the terms at
which a similar loan would currently be made by the Bank

to a similar borrower. Such terms generally include a service charge of | percent and a final maturity of abour 40
years. For such loans, fair value approximates the carrying
amount. The estimated fair value of loans is not affected by
credit risks because the amount of any such adjustment is
not considered to have a material effect based on the
Bank's experience with its borrowers.

Undisbursed loan commitments and an analysis of loans by
countries as of 31 December 1997 and 31 December 1996
are shown in ADF-4.

The principal amount outstanding of public sector loans
placed in non-accrual status as of 31 December 1997 was
$61,341,000 ($56,226,000 — 1996) of which $8,620,000
($7,237,000 — 1996) was overdue. Overdue charges on
these loans totalled $2,460,000 ($1,995,000 - 1996). Placing these loans in a non-accrual status resulted in a reduction of $736,000 ($744,000 — 1996) in revenue from loans
for the year ended 31 December 1997, The loans in nonaccrual status as of 31 December 1997 were four loans
made to Afghanistan and twelve loans to Solomon Islands.
(Four loans to Afghanistan and nine loans to Solomon
Islands were placed in non-accrual status as of 31 Decem
ber 1996),

Private sector loans outstanding as of 31 December 1997
were $13,518,000 ($14,539,000 -— 1996), net of accumulated provision for loan losses as of 31 December 1997 of
$1,634,000 ($1,778,000 — 1996), and there were no undisbursed loan commitments (nil — 1996).

Loan Loss Provision

The Bank makes specific provision for possible losses on
loans to the private sector when principal or service charges
are in arrears for six months or more, based on an evaluation by the Bank of the collectibility of loans outstanding.
On the remainder of the private sector portfolio, the Bank
makes a general loan loss provision at a rate approved by
the Board of Directors.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(With Comparative Amounts at 31 December 1996)

a ELT

The Bank makes specific provision for possible losses on
loans made to the public sector when principal or service
charges are in arrears for a year or more unless there is clear
and convincing evidence warranting the deferment or acceleration of such provisioning. The amount of any specific
loss provision is determined by comparing the carrying
value of the loan to the present value of expected cash
inflows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate.

As of 31 December 1997, loan loss provisions amounting to
$3,943,000 (nil — 1996) have been made against public
sector loans while $1,634,000 ($1,778,000 — 1996) have
been made against private sector loans.

NOTE E — NOTES OF CONTRIBUTORS

 

Notes of contributors are non-negotiable, non-interestbearing and, subject to certain restrictions imposed by applicable Board of Governors’ resolutions, encashable by the
Bank at par upon demand.

The Bank currently expects thar the notes outstanding at
31 December 1997 will be encashed in varying amounts
over the ten-year period ending 31 December 2007.

Notes of contributors are fair valued using an entry value
method whereby fair value is determined based on the
terms at which notes are currently being accepted from
contributors. On this basis, fair value of outstanding notes
of contributors approximates carrying amount.

NOTE F - ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
AND ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

Administrative expenses include an administration charge
from Ordinary Capital Resources amounting to $96,452,000

i

212ADF-6

 

($81,991,000 - 1996). The charge represents an apportionment of all administrative expenses of the Bank (other
than those appertaining directly to ordinary operations and
special operations) based on the number of loans and equity investments approved during the year.

NOTE G — SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph L(i) of
the Articles of Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter), the Board of Governors has
authorized the setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired
“paid-in” capital paid by members pursuant to Article 6,
paragraph 2(a) of the Charter and of the convertible currency portion paid by members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(b) of the Charter as of 28 April 1973, to be used
as a part of the Special Funds of the Bank. The capital so
set aside was allocated and transferred from the Ordinary
Capital Resources to the Fund as Set-Aside Resources.

The capital stock of the Bank is defined in Article 4,
paragraph 1 of the Charter, “in terms of United States
dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on 31 January
1966" (the 1966 dollar). Therefore, Set-Aside Resources
had historically been translated into the current United
States dollar (the Bank's unit of account), on the basis of
its par value in terms of gold. From 1973 until 31 March
1978, the rate arrived at on this basis was $1.20635 per
1966 dollar. Since | April 1978, at which time the Second
Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect, currencies
no longer have par values in terms of gold. Pending the
Bank's selection of the appropriate successor to the 1966
dollar, the Set-Aside Resources has been valued for purposes of the accompanying financial statements in terms of

the Special Drawing Right (SDR), at the value in current
United States dollars as computed by the IMF, As of 31
December 1997, the value of the SDR in terms of the
current United States dollar was $1.34925 ($1.43520 —
1996). On this basis, Set-Aside Resources amounted to
$64,237,000 ($68,329,000 — 1996). If the capital stock of
the Bank as of 31 December 1997 had been valued in terms
of $12,063.50 per share, Set-Aside Resources would have
been $57,434,000.

NOTE H - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations are nor readily available are valued using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily require the use of
subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which
such financial instruments could be exchanged ina current
transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not determinable.

The Fund's balance sheet carrying amounts are considered
to approximate fair values for all significant financial instruments. See Notes B, C, D and E for discussions with
respect to investments, loans and notes of contributors,
respectively,

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1997
(With Comparative Amounts at 31 December 1996)

 

NOTE A —- NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) was established to provide technical assistance on a grant basis to the
Bank's developing member countries and for regional technical assistance. TASF resources consist of direct voluntary
contributions by members, allocations from the net income
of Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR) and Asian Development Fund (ADF) contributions, and revenue from investments and other sources.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statements of the TASF are presented on the
basis of unrestricted, temporarily restricted and permanently restricted net assets.

TASF reports the contributions of cash and other assets as
restricted support if they are received with donor stipulations thar limit the use of the donated assets. When a
donor restriction expires, that is, when a stipulated time or
purpose restriction is accomplished, temporarily restricted
net assets are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and
reported in the Statement of Activities and Changes in Net
Assets as net assets released from restrictions.

Investments

All investment securities held by TASF are reported at
estimated fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and
losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value generally
represents market value. Cost or amortised cost is used to
approximate fair value for certain short-term investments
not traded in the market (time deposits, etc.).

Contributions

Contributions from members are included in the financial
statements from the date contribution agreements become

220

       

effective. Contributions from donors which are restri
by them to technical assistance (TA) projects/pr
with specified procurement sources are classified as temporarily restricted contributions. Those without any stipulations as to specific use are accounted for as unrestricted
contributions.

Services to Member Countries

Services to member countries are recognized in the financial statements of TASF when the TA projects/programs —
are approved and effective. Upon completion of the TA
projects/programs, any undisbursed amounts are written
back as a reduction in the services to member countries for
the year and the corresponding undisbursed commitments
are reduced.

Reporting Currency

The financial statements of TASF are expressed in thousands of current United States dollars. As a matter of
convenience, the United States dollar, the reporting currency, is used to measure exchange gains and losses.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities and uncommitted balances in currencies
other than United States dollars are translated at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period.
Contributions included in the financial statements during
the year are translated initially at applicable exchange rates
as of the respective dates when the contributions become
effective. As to cumulative contributions received, the
utilized portions are translated at the applicable exchange
rates as of the respective dates of use whereas the unutilized
portions are translated at the applicable exchange rates as
of the end of a reporting period. Revenue and expense
amounts in currencies other than United States dollars are
translated for each semi-monthly period generally at the
applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period; such practice approximates the application of average |
rates in effect during the period. Translation adjustmentsTASF-6

CONTINUED

 

are accounted for as exchange gains or losses and are charged
or credited to operations.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of
the year and the reported amounts of income and expenses
during the year. The actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the TASF
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS”.

NOTE C — INVESTMENTS

The currency compositions of the investment portfolio as

of 31 December 1997 and 31 December 1996 were as
follows:

Currency 1997 1996
Australian. dollar $ 5,231,000 $ 6,213,000
Canadian dollar 89,047,000 89,423,000
Deutsche mark 5,821,000 7,243,000
French franc 10,000 4,131,000
Italian lira 4,490,000 4,834,000
Japanese yen 77,000 25,523,000
Netherlands guilder 2,286,000 3,222,000
Swedish krona 1,205,000 1,281,000
Swiss franc 40,040,000 60,602,000
United States dollar 1,982,000 2,923,000
Others 4,232,000 5,472,000

Totals $154,421.00 $210,867,000

The annualized rate of return on the average investments
held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the
beginning and end of each month was 3.18% (3.63% —
1996).

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors. The main investment
management objective is to maintain security and liquidity.
Subject to these parameters, the Bank seeks the highest
possible return on its investments.

NOTE D - FUNDING

Since 1967, contributions have been made by 31 member
countries. In February 1992, the Board of Governors, in
authorizing a $4,200,000,000 replenishment of the ADF,
provided for an allocation to the TASF in an aggregate
amount equivalent to $140,000,000 to be used for technical assistance to poorer developing members and for regional technical assistance. This replenishment became
effective in August 1992.

The Board of Governors allocated $81,000,000 to TASF
from the 1994 net income of the OCR in 1995. Since then,
there has been no further allocation.

Some of the contributions received were restricted to use
upon procurement sources, while some were given on condition that the technical assistance be made on reimbursable basis.

The total contributions received for the years ended
31 December 1997 and 31 December 1996 were as follows:

1997 1996
Unrestricted contributions $1,126,000 $4,651,000
Temporarily restricted
contributions 192,000 63,000
Total contributions $1,318,000 $4,714,000

NOTE E - UNDISBURSED COMMITMENTS

Undisbursed commitments represent effective ongoing grantfinanced TA projects/programs which are not yet disbursed
as of the end of the year. The fair value of such commitments approximates the amounts undisbursed because the
Bank expects that grants will be made for all projects/
programs covered by the commitments. When technical
assistance provided as a project preparatory grant leads to
a Bank loan, the amount of the grant exceeding $250,000
will be refinanced under the terms of that Bank loan.
Refinanced amounts of $656,000 ($317,000 — 1996) were
charged to such loans and credited to revenue from other
sources of the TASF during the year ended 31 December
1997,

NOTE F — FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

222

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily require the use of
subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which
such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current
transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not determinable.

The Fund’s statement of financial position carrying amounts
are considered to approximate fair values for all significant
financial instruments. See Notes B and E for discussions
with respect to investments and undisbursed commitments,

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CONTINUED

 

NOTE A — NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Japan Special Fund (JSF) was established in March
1988 when Japan and the Bank entered into a financial
arrangement whereby Japan agreed to make an initial contribution and the Bank became the administrator. The
purpose of JSF is to help developing member countries of
the Bank restructure their economies and broaden the
scope of opportunities for new investments, thereby assisting the recycling of funds to developing member countries
of the Bank. While the JSF resources are used mainly to
finance technical assistance (TA) operations, these resources may also be used for equity investment operations
in the Bank's developing member countries. Under the
agreement between the Bank and the Government of Japan,
the Bank may invest the proceeds of JSF pending disbursement. The revenue from such investments, if retained by
the Bank, may only be used to pay for direct and identifiable costs incurred in the administration of JSF.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statements of the JSF are presented on the
basis of unrestricted and temporarily restricted net assets.

JSF reports the contributions of cash and other assets as
restricted support if they are received with donor stipulations that limit the use of the donated assets. When the
donor restriction expires, that is, when a stipulated time or
purpose restriction is accomplished, temporarily restricted
net assets are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and
reported in the Statement of Activities and Changes in Net
Assets as net assets released from restrictions.

Investments
All investment securities held by JSF are reported at esti
mated fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and
losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value generally

represents marker value. Cost or amortised cost is used to
approximate fair value for certain short-term investments
not traded in the market (time deposits, ete.).

Contributions

Contributions by Japan are included in the financial statements from the date indicated by the government of Japan
that funds are expected to be made available. Contributions which are restricted by the donor for specific TA
projects/programs are classified as temporarily restricted
contributions. Those without any stipulation as to specific
use are accounted for as unrestricted contributions and
reported as such.

Services to Member Countries

Services to member countries are recognized in the financial statements of JSF when the TA projects/programs are
approved and effective. In general, TA projects/programs
become effective when a letter of agreement has been
signed by the beneficiary. Upon completion of the TA
projects/programs, any undisbursed amounts are written
back as a reduction in the services to member countries for
the year and the corresponding undisbursed commitments
are reduced accordingly.

Functional Currency and Reporting Currency

The functional currency of JSF is the Japanese yen while
the reporting currency is the United States dollar. The
financial statements are expressed in thousands of current
United States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities and uncommitted balances are translated
from the functional currency to the reporting currency at
the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting
period. Contributions included in the financial statements
during the year are translated at the applicable exchange
rates as of the dates the contributions are received. Rev

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1997
(With Comparative Amounts at 31 December 1996)

i

enue and expense amounts in Japanese yen are translated
for each semi-monthly period at the applicable rates of
exchange at the beginning of each period; such practice
approximates the application of average rates in effect during
the period. Exchange gains or losses on currency transactions arise on translation differences between the date a
project/program is committed and the timing of disbursements. Exchange gains or losses are charged or credited to
operations.

Equity Investments

Equity investments with readily determinable fair values
are reported at fair value. The Bank makes provisions for
possible loss of value quarterly based on management's
evaluation of potential losses on investments without readily
determinable fair values.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of
the year and the reported amounts of income and expenses
during the year. The actual results could differ from those
estimates,

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the JSF
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS’.

NOTE C - INVESTMENTS

The currency compositions of the investment portfolio as

of 31 December 1997 and 31 December 1996 were as
follows:

228

Currency 1997 1996
Japanese yen $151,829,000 $416,146,000
United States dollar 117,085,000 ~

Totals $268,914,000 $416,146,000

As of 31 December 1997, the estimated fair value of the
investments was $269,452,000 ($416,146,000 — 1996), and
was due in one year or less.

The annualized rate of return on the average investments
held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the
beginning and end of each month was 0.68% (0.60% —
1996),

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors, The main investment
management objective is to maintain security and liquidity.
Subject to these parameters, the Bank seeks the highest
possible return on its investments.

NOTE D - EQUITY INVESTMENTS

The Bank used JSF resources to make an equity investment
in India in 1990 totalling $373,000 at 31 December 1997
($702,000 — 1996). The investment is reported at its estimated fair value and the unrealized loss (gain — 1996) is
included in income for the year.

NOTE E — UNDISBURSED COMMITMENTS

Undisbursed commitments are denominated in United States
dollars and represent effective technical assistance for
projects/ programs which have not been disbursed. The fair
value of such commitments approximates the amounts
outstanding because JSF expects that disbursements will
substantially be made for all the projects/programs covered
by the commitments.JSF-4

CONTINUED

 

NOTE F - UNCOMMITTED BALANCES

Uncommitted balances are composed of amounts which
have not been committed by the Bank as at 31 December
1997. These balances include TA projects/programs that
had been approved but which had not yet become effective.

As of 31 December 1997 and 31 December 1996 these
balances were as follows:

1997 1996

Uncommitted Balances $164,105,000 $272,960,000
TA projects/programs
approved by the
Government of Japan
and the Bank bur
not yer effective (49,243,000) (25,313,000)
TA projects/programs

Government of Japan
and not yet effective (44,236,000) (28,915,000)
Uncommitted Balances
Available for new
Commitments

$ 70,626,000 $218,732,000

NOTE G — CONTRIBUTIONS AND
TEMPORARILY RESTRICTED
NET ASSETS

All contributions for the years ended 31 December 1997
and 31 December 1996 were received during the respective
years. Some of the contributions received were with the
restriction that they were to be utilized for specific TA
projects/programs. Such contributions were classified as
temporarily restricted support.

Temporarily restricted uncommitted balances are available
for the following purposes as of 31 December 1997 and
31 December 1996;

1997 1996
Environment-telated Activities $20,113,000 $37,596,000
Private Sector Promotion 8,760,000 14,963,000
Women in Development 5,586,000 8,367,000
Training/Symposium 183,000 239,000
Totals $34,642,000 $61,165,000

Accumulated investment income net of accumulated administrative expenses has been categorized as temporarily
restricted net assets because, under the terms of the agreement between the Bank and the donor, it may only be used
for the defrayment of the Fund's administrative expenses.

Accumulated investment income net of accumulated administrative expenses of $41,942,000 at 31 December 1996
and related accounts in the 1996 statement of activities
and changes in net assets have been reclassified from unrestricted to temporarily restricted net assets to conform with
the 1997 presentation.

Net assets released from restrictions relate to commitments
for services to member countries satisfying the conditions
specified by the donor and, in the case of accumulated
investment income, to defray the administrative expenses
of the Fund.

NOTE H — FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

 

229ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK - JAPAN SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1997
(With Comparative Amounts at 31 December 1996)

JSF-4

 

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily require the use of
subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which
such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current

transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not determinable.

The Fund's statement of financial position carrying amounts
are considered to approximate fair values for all significant
financial instruments. See Notes B, C, D and E for discussions with respect to investments, equity investments and
undisbursed commitments, respectively.Price Waterhouse The Hague New York

NOTE A - NATURE OF OPERATIONS

In 1996, the Bank approved the establishment of the Asian
Development Bank Institute (the Institute) in Tokyo, Japan
as an integral part of the Bank. The Institute was inaugurated on 10 December 1997. The Institute maintains its
own financial accounts to be financed by a Special Fund.
The Institute's operations commenced upon the receipt of
the first fund from the Government of Japan on 24 March
1997. The Institute’s funds consist of voluntary contributions, donations, and grants from members, nongovernment organizations and foundations. The primary objective
of the Institute is the improvement of the capacity for
sound management of the agencies and organizations in
developing member countries (DMCs) engaged in development work. The Institute serves as a major focal point for
research on innovative development strategies and for training in development management for policymakers and senior managers from DMCs.

NOTE B — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statements of the Institute are presented on
the basis of those for not-for-profit organizations.

The Institute reports the contributions of cash and other
assets as unrestricted support as these are contributed by
donors without conditions other than for the purposes of
pursuing the objectives of the Institute.

Investments

All investment securities held by the Institute are reported
at estimated fair value, with realized and unrealized gains
and losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value generally represents market value, Cost or amortised cost is used
to approximate fair value for certain short-term investments not traded in the market (time deposits, ete.).

Property, Fiemiture and Equipment

Property, furniture and equipment is stated at cost and is
depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the
straight-line method.

Contributions

Contributions from donors are included in the financial
statements from the date indicated by the donors that
funds are expected to be made available.

Functional Currency and Reporting Currency

The currencies of contributing members are functional
currencies. The reporting currency is the United States
dollar and the financial statements are expressed in thousands of current United States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities and uncommitted balances are translated
from the functional currency to the reporting currency at
the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting
period. Contributions included in the financial statements
during the period are translated at the applicable exchange
rates as of the dates the contributions are received. Revenue and expense amounts in currency other than US
dollar are translated for each semi-monthly period at the
applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period; such practice approximates the application of average
rates in effect during the period.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of
the period and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the period. The actual results could differ
from those estimates.

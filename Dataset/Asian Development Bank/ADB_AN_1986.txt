1986The Asian Development Bank

The Asian Development Bank, an international partnership of
47 member countries, is engaged in promoting the economic and
social progress of its developing member countries in the Asia-Pacific
region

The Bank started functioning in December 1966 with its Headquarters in Manila, Philippines. It is owned by the governments of
32 countries from the Asia-Pacific region and 15 countries from Europe
and North America,

In 20 years of operations, the Bank has become a major catalyst
in promoting the development of the most populous and fastest growing region in the world today. The Bank's principal functions are:
{i) to make loans and equity investments for the economic and social
advancement of developing member countries; (ii) to provide technical
assistance for the preparation and execution of development projects
and programs and advisory services; (iii) to promote investment of
public and private capital for development purposes; and (iv) to respond to requests for assistance in cvordinating development policies
and plans of member countries. In its operations, the Bank is also
required to give special attention to the needs of the smaller or less
developed countries and give priority to regional, subregional and
national projects and programs which will contribute to the harmonious
economic growth of the region as a whole.

The financial resources of the Bank consist of ordinary capital
resources, comprising subscribed capital, reserves and funds raised
through borrowings; and Special Funds, comprising contributions
made by member countries and amounts previously set aside from
the paid-in capital. Loans from ordinary capital resources, which account for 68 per cent of Bank lending, are generally made to member
countries which have attained a somewhat higher level of economic
development. Loans from the Asian Development Fund are made
on highly concessional terms and almost exclusively to the poorest
borrowing countries.

The Bank has borrowed funds for its ordinary operations from
the capital markets of Europe, Japan, the Middle East and the United
States. The Bank's callable capital, which at the end of 1986 accounted
for nearly 88 per cent of its subscribed capital, backs Its borrowings
in the capital markets.

The Bank's operations cover the entire spectrum of economic
development, with particular emphasis on agriculture, rural development, energy and social infrastructure. Most Bank financing is designed
to support specific projects. In certain cases, the Bank also provides
program, sector and multiproject loans.

The Bank actively pursues co-financing activities with official as
well as commercial and export credit sources. The Bank has also
entered into equity investment operations. .

The Bank’s highest policy-making body is its Board of Governors which meets annually. The direction of the Bank's general operations is the responsibility of the Board of Directors — composed of
12 Directors (each with an Alternate) — eight representing regional
countries and four representing non-regional countries. The Board
of Governors conducts an election for the Board of Directors every
two years.

The President of the Bank is elected by the Board of Governors
for a term of five years, after which he may be re-elected. The President is Chairman of the Board of Directors and under its direction
he conducts the business of the Bank. In this he is assisted by the
Vice-Presidents, who are appointed by the Board of Directors on the
recommendation of the President.

The Bank has 21 departments and offices — including a Resident Office in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and a South Pacific Regional Office in Port Vila, Vanuatu — dealing with various operational, financial, administrative and general support functions.

Office of the President
20 March 1987

Dear Mr. Chairman:

In accordance with Article 39 of the Articles
of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank and
Section 13 of its By-Laws, I submit to the Board of
Governors the enclosed Annual Report of the Bank
for 1986, including a separate report on the activities
of the Special Funds of the Bank, which has been
prepared under the direction of the Board of Directors. The Annual Report also includes the financial
statements prescribed in Section 15 of the By-Laws.

Sincerely yours,

Vberns J tpubom

MASAO FUJIOKA
President and
Chairman of the
Board of Directors

 

Chairman of the
Board of Governors
Asian Development BankTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

THE Board of Governors is vested with all the powers of the
Bank. With the exception of certain powers specifically
resérved to them under the Charter of the Bank, the Board
of Governors has delegated its powers to the Board of Directors which is responsible for the direction of the general operations of the Bank. The Board of Directors performs its duties
on a full-time basis at the Bank’s Headquarters and meets in
formal! session under the chairmanship of the President of the
Bank.

The Charter provides for a Board of 12 Directors who are
elected by the Governors. A list of the 12 Directors and their
Alternates follows in this Chapter, while more details on the
Board membership and voting groups are provided in
Appendix 4.

Spain becaine a member of the Bank in February 1986 and
joined the constituency of Belgium, France, Italy and
Switzerland. Following the admission of the People’s Republic
of China to membership of the Bank in March 1986, arrangements were made for the representative of the People’s
Republic of China to attend the Board meetings on a nonvoting basis, pending the biennial eiection of Directors to be
held at the 1987 Annual Meeting. The Bank’s membership
now covers half the population of the world.

General

The Board held 48 formal meetings in 1986 as well as
informal meetings and seminars on various policy and other
issues.

The Board approved 52 loans totalling $2,001 million for
48 projects, four equity investments amounting to $8.2 million
and 134 grani-financed technical assistance projects amounting to $38.6 million of which $14.6 million is being provided
from non-Bank sources.

_ The Board approved borrowings totalling the equivalent of

- $812.8 million in US dollars, Swiss francs, Japanese yen,
Deutsche mark and Duich guilders, including the Bank’s first
zero coupon bond issue in the Swiss capital market.

' Notable “Firsts”

Following approval in 1985 of the Bank's policy on lending

to the private sector without government guarantee, the Board

approved the first loan to a private sector enterprise without
government guarantee for the Cherat Cement Company, Ltd.
in Pakistan to assist the company to double its existing
capacity. The loan was given in Swiss francs equivalent to
$5 million.

The first Bank loan to a financial institution without government guarantee was approved for the National Development
Leasing Corporation, Ltd. (NDLC) of Pakistan. This loan, also
equivalent to $5 million in Swiss francs, was to enable NDLC
to finance the foreign exchange cost! of directiy-imported
equipment intended for acquisition through lease financing
by its private sector customers; mainly in the manufacturing
sector.

The Bank's first loan to India was approved for the Industrial
Credit and Investment Corporation of India, Ltd. (ICICI) in
the amount of $100 million to provide a credit line for onlending to private sector industrial enterprises.

Policy Review

Early in 1986, the Board reviewed the policies and procedures in managing the environmental aspects of the Bank’s
various development projects, and noted the accomplishments
since the latest formal review of environmental considerations
in 1980. The Board urged Management to increase its efforts
in assessing the environmental effects of Bank projects and
in promoting the development of the institutional capacities
of the Bank’s developing member countries (DMCs) to plan
and follow a sound environment policy.

The Board reviewed the Bank's domestic procurement
policy and approved the adoption of a domestic preference
scheme for the procurement of works and goods under
international competitive bidding. This scheme is on similarlines to the World Bank scheme and will be in operation for
a trial period of five years, during which it will be reviewed
by the Board.

The Board, in view of the importance it places on technical
assistance io DMCs, discussed the future direction of the
Bank’s technical assistance operations and authorized various
adjustments in technical assistance practices and procedures
with the aim of improving its quality and effectiveness. A sum
of $72 million of the fourth replenishment of the Asian
Development Fund (ADF V) was earmarked for transfer to
the Technical Assistance Special Fund {TASF), thereby
ensuring a systematic replenishment of the TASF.

The variable lending rate system, approved by the Board
in 1985, came into effect on 1 July 1986. The lending rate,
which is adjusted every six months taking into account the
cost of the Bank’s borrowings, was initially determined at
7.65 per cent per annum. In January 1987, the rate was
lowered to 7.36 per cent per annum. As part of a planned
review of various aspects of financial policy in connection with
the move to the variable lending rate system, the Board
reviewed the Bank's policy and practices regarding the levying of premiums on prepayment of OCR loans. The Board
decided to retain a schedule of premiums on prepayment of
such loans, although calculated under a new methodology
suitable to the variable lending rate sysiem. The Board also
agreed that the Bank should continue to consider sympathetically any request for a waiver of the premium in the
light of prevailing circumstances.

At the Nineteenth Annual Meeting, the Board of Governors requested the Board of Directors to undertake a study
of the Bank’s future resource requirements for its ordinary
operations. As the first step in this study, the Board (in informai session} commenced a review of the Bank’s financial
policies, focusing particularly on liquidity, income, reserves
and borrowing limitations. Further steps in the process will
include a review of the Bank's operational priorities and plans
for the rest of the 1980s, and consideration of the possible
OCR lending program in the period of the next General
Capital Increase (GCI [V) and the organizational, staffing and
financial implications of such a program. The study, which
will continue through 1987, is intended to culminate in the
submission of a specific proposal on GCI [V to the Board of
Governors.

A preliminary discussion was held on the establishment of
criteria for considering new requests for Special Capital
Increases (SCI). The Board twice extended the date for
subscriptions to the SCls already approved by the Board of
Governors in 1985.

_ Board members continued to be concerned by the uneven
scheduling of projects for Board consideration, which resulted
in “bunching” of loan proposals towards the end of the year.
The problem was particularly acute in 1986, with the Board
considering and approving in the final quarter about 77 per
cent of the total lending commitments for the year. It was
recognized that certain unusual country specific reasons had
contributed to the imbalance in 1986, nevertheless, Directors
asked Management to review the causes and offered their
support in seeking to ensure a smoother project cycle in 1987
and beyond

Special Project Implementation Assistance

The Board held several informal meetings during the year
to discuss the specific difficulties being faced by two of its
borrowers — Indonesia and the Philippines — and to attempi
to develop types of assistance best suited to their situations.

After approving no loans to the Philippines in 1985, the
Board approved, in April, two Special Project Implementation Assistance loans totalling $100 million equivalent (half
from OCR, half from ADF} to finance the Government's local
currency expenditures in 1986 and 1987 for 36 ongoing Bankassisted projects. Four other loans and one equity investment
were also approved in 1986.

In recognition of the Indonesian Government's severe fiscal
and budgetary constraints in the face of falling oil and commodity prices, the Board approved in July the use of loan
savings to meet local currency shortfalls of ongoing Bankassisted irrigation projects in Indonesia while in November the
reallocation of loan savings and accelerated loan
disbursements were approved to help meet local currency
shortfalls of several ongoing projects in other sectors. In
December, a Special Project lmplementation Assistance loan
of $30.6 million was approved to meet the local currency
shortfalls of six ongoing Bank-assisted projects in Indonesia's
education sector.

Equity Operations

A further allocation of $25 million was made available for
commitment under the Bank’s equity investment operation
bringing the total allocation to $35 million. Although such
operations had been slow to start since the Bank introduced
its equity financing program in 1983, increasing interest has
been shown in utilizing this window of the Bank’s operations.

Resident Offices

With a view to increasing the effectiveness of the Bank’s
lending operations in Indonesia, the Board approved the
establishment of an Indonesia Resident Office (RO) in Jakarta
by mid-1987.

The Board approved an increase from four to six in the professional staff of the South Pacific Regional Office (SPRO).
This followed a Bank review of SPRO's operations which
recommended the strengthening of country economic and
programming work in the field and freeing existing staff to
spend more time on project administration.

The Board also established general criteria for use in
evaluating the need for Bank resident offices in DMCs and
authorized the Bank’s management to review the need for
temporary or “facilitating” offices in special situations.

A Working Paper was discussed on the possibility of
establishing a Bank resident office in a second time zone to
increase the effectiveness of the Bank’s treasury operations.
It was decided to resume discussions at a later date, after
various financial and other issues had been clarified.Administration

On the recommendation of the President, the Board reappointed Mr. Gtinther Schulz as a Vice-President of the Bank

_ for a term of three years and three months from 1 April 1986.

- . The Board approved a nine per cent increase in salary and

an adjustment of the dependency allowance for supporting
staff. For professional staff, it approved a three per cent
increase plus continuation of the $950 modified dependency
allowance and raised the ceiling for the education grant. The
Board also approved a Housing Loan Program for supporting staff which is aimed ai providing its staff members with
the means to secure housing of a suitable standard.

The Board approved capiial expenditure programs to
advance the Bank’s computer and office automation systems
during the period 1986-88.

ADF Replenishment

The Board: followed the progress of negotiations for the
fourth ADF replenishment (ADF V) which cuiminated in an
agreement on a replenishmeni total of $3.6 billion at the
meeting of ADF donors held in Manila from 28 to 30 Aprii
1986.

The Board reviewed the arrangements agreed upon at this
meeting relating to country strategies, policy dialogue and
project quality and submitted a draft Resolution on the
arrangements which was subsequently approved by the Board
of Governors.

Directors’ Visits

Short visits were made to the following DMCs by small

groups of Directors to enable them to obtain a first-hand impression of the Bank's operations. The-participants also held
discussions on relevant policy issues with DMC authorities:

‘{i) Thailand and Malaysia — 23 February to 9 March
1986
tii) Indonesia — 18 to 28 October 1986.

Standing Committees

Membership of the Board’s three Standing Committees is
contained in Appendix 5 of this Annual Report.

The Audit Committee reviewed the Bank’s Financial
Statements and the scope of the outside audit and considered
various interna! audit matters. Considering the importance of
post-evaluation results which can serve as an effective tool
to improve project design and implementation of subsequent
projects, the Committee examined the activities of the PostEvaluation Office (PEO) and reviewed eight Project Perfor
...«: Mance Audit Reports (PPARs). The Committee considered
«sand endorsed the Report of the President on Post-Evaluation

    

Activities in 1985 and the Eighth Review of Post-Evaluation

 

Reports. As a resuli of its review the Commitiee, after discussion with staff, made a number of suggestions for future action.
The Budget Review Committee exarnined in detail the proposals of the 1987 Administrative Budget for which an
expenditure commitment of $94.2 million was submitted for
Board consideration. In recommending the 1987 Budget, the
Committee emphasized in its report the importance of further
improving staff productivity (through various means such as
redeployment, training and early retirement schemes) to
enable the Bank to make maximurn use of existing personnel. Particular importance was attached to the development
and pursuit of appropriate personnel policies which would
enhance work efficiency and restrain the growth of the Budget:
The Boare approved the Budget noting that it stood reduced
by $805,000 to $93.4 million due to the lower-than-assumed
general salary increase for proiessional staff in 1986.

The Committee on Administrative Matters Relating to
members for computer/word processing facilities and recommended the provision of these facilities to Directors’ Offices.
Among other activities, it reviewed the guidelines of the
scheme for Directors’ visits to developing member couniries.

commitments rose to $2,001 million, 4.9 per cent above the
1985 figure of $1,908 million. This slight increase was less
than had been anticipated, reflecting high debt levels and

budgetary constraints in some developing member countries *

(DMCs) as well as generally low commodity prices worldwide
which depressed their export earnings. Other factors include
the limited ability of some DMCs to absorb external assistance
efficiently and the cutback in planned invesiments in oilexporting DMCs due to jiower oil prices.

Lending was lower to most traditional major borrowers. On
the other hand, the Bank approved its first loans to India and
zesumed lending to the Philippines.

Loans irom ordinary capital resources (OCR) amounted to
$1,368 million, an increase of 7.6 per cent over
$1,271 million in 1985. Loans from-the Asian Development
Fund (ADF) amounted to $633 million, fractionally less than
$637 million a year earlier.

The Bank approved three equity investments during the
year amounting to $3.2 million and one line of equity of $5
tnillion, bringing the cumulative total to $15.2 million after

as members for the first time. Mr. Masao Fujioka was
unanimously elected President for a second five-year term.

Donor countries agreed in April upon a fourth ADF
replenishment (ADF V) of $3.6 billion which is intended to
finance the Bank's concessional lending program in the four

During the year, 52 loans were approved for 48 projects
in 19 DMCs compared with 48 loans for 46 projects in 13
DMCs in 1985. The average loan size decreased by 3.3 per
cent to $38.5 million from $39.8 million. The size of individual
loans ranged from $700.000 for a loan to Kiribati to
$150 million for loans to India and Pakistan.

Co-financing declined by about 23 per cent to $492 million
from $640 million in 1985. Official sources of co-financing
rose by 13 per cent to $379 million from $335 million in 1985,
and their share of total co-financing rose sharply to 77 per
cent from 52 per cent in 1985. Co-financing from commercial sources, at $113 million, was only about one-third of the
1985 figure of $305 million, or 23 per cent of the total
compared with 48 per cent a year earlier.

On a sectoral basis, Bank lending for agriculture and agroindustry increased very sharply to $822 million, or 41 per cent
of total lending, from $559 million, or 29 per cent, in 1985.
This rise. as well as the broad distribution of loans in this sector
to 11 DMCs, reflects the continued priority given both by the
DMCs and the Bank to agriculture, the main source of employment and overail economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region.

Lending for energy projects more than doubled in 1986,
both in volume (to $515 million from $245 million a year
earlier) and as a percentage of overall Bank lending (to
26 per cent from less than 13 per cent in 1985). Loans for
rehabilitating and constructing transmission and distribution
lines, as well as the Bank’s first power loan to India, contributed
to the increase.

On the other hand, lending for social infrastructure — water
supply and sanitation, urban development and housing,
education, and health and population — dropped to

$272 million from $544 million, while the percentage share
slid to 14 per cent from 28 per cent — the second highest
share — in 1985. The decline was partly due to the approval
of only one urban development and housing loan of $55
million in 1986 compared with three loans totalling $215
million in this subsector in 1985. Nevertheless, the 1986 social
infrastructure figures were above those of 1984, when lending for this sector amounted to $240 million and constituted
11 per cent of the total.

Bank lending for projects in the transport and communications sector also declined to $179 million (9 per cent of the
jotal) from $310 million (16 per cent) in 1985. Activities
included three road improvement projects in response to
substantial traffic growth in many DMCs, a roadworks
mechanization project designed to support construction and
maintenance capabilities and supplementary assistance
provided to complete an airport terminal building

The decline in lending to the social infrastructure and
transport and communications sectors partly reflected restrictions on borrowing by two countries (indonesia and Thailand)
which had been major borrowers for large-size projects in these
sectors in 1985.

Lending to the industry and non-fuel minerals sector,
including development banks, fell steeply to $110 million, or
5.5 per cent of the total, from $243 million (13 per cent) in
1985. This was mainly due to fewer requests for credit lines
as well as the access which certain development finance
institutions had to the international capital market.

During the year, the Bank approved Special Project
Implementation Assistance loans arnounting to $130.6 million
— to the Philippines ($100 million) and indonesia
($30.6 million). These loans will finance the local currency
requirements of high-priority ongoing Bank-financed projects,

$181 million for 142 projects in 1985. By the end of 1986.
project preparatory technical assistance amounting to
$231 million had been provided which has so far resulted in

  
 

* 397 Bank loan projects amounting to $8.9 billion and

involving an estimated total investment cost of about
$22.2 billion. By the end of 1986. the Bank had approved
$1.3 billion for advisory and project implementation technical
assistance and $37.4 million for regional activities.

Loan disoursements rose 1.4 per cent and slightly exceeded
$1 billion for the third consecutive year. Disbursements under
ADF loans rose 5.6 per cent to $412 million from $390 million
in 1985 — the fifth consecutive rise. The better ADF disbursement performance in 1986 was partly due to ADF

-disbursemenis. under the Special Project Implementation—.

Assistance loan to the Philippines and partly due to better project implementation performance ir ceriain sectors. Ordinary
capital resources loan disbursements fell 1.3 per cent to $612
million from $620 million in 1985 due to the lower-thanexpected price bids received for civil works contracts, the delay
in the awarding of contracis for some power projects against
which substantial down payments were expected to have been
made in 1986, as well as the unusually large amount of OCR
loan cancellations {$530.8 million in 1986 compared with
$305.8 million in 1985)

During 1986, the net transfer of resources oy the Bank to
its DMCs {i.e., loan disbursements less repayments of principal, interest and other charges) fell to $237.4 million from
$421.3 million in 1985. The reasons for this variance are
increasing loan repayments compared with stable

—SSSSSSU ti SSS SSSECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

DURING 1986. a majority of the Bank's deveioping member ____

countries (DMCs) improved their overall economic growth performance. However, some DMCs dependent on primary
commodity exports experienced recession for the second
successive year due to depressed levels of commodity prices.
The aggregate trade deficit of DMCs ceclined sharply and their
average inflation rate remained at a moderate level. DMCs
generally pursued more stringent borrowing and debimanagement policies, made efforts to improve their domestic
_ economic policies and institutions to support increased
mobilization of domestic resources, and adopied measures
to enhance productive efficiency and allocate resources more
_ inline with market signals and comparative advantage.

International Setting

 

‘During the year, the world economy experienced a major
realignment of exchange rates, low and declining prices of
Primary commodities, including oil, and failing interest rates.
The yen and several major European currencies appreciated
markediy against the US dollar. Interest rates in the interna-tional capital market also came down considerably during the

“year. While the effect of these developments will take sorne
time to be fully felt, in 1986 world economic growth was iower
than in 1985.

The worldwide economic recovery which began in 1983
after four years of recession lost some of its momentum as
the growth rate of world output declined to 2.8 per cent from
3.1 per cent in 1985 and 4.4 per cent in 1984. On the other
hand. the world infiation rate fell to 9.4 per cent in 1986 from
13.8 per cent in 1985 and the rate of expansion of world trade
increased to 4.3 per cent from 3.1 per cent in the same period.

Despite several favorable factors, including reduced interest
rates and an improved balance-of-payments position,
economic activity in industrialized counnies slowed down. The
growth in their aggregate real gross national product (GNP)
fell to 2.7 per cent in 1986 from 3 per cent in 1985, as
economic activity remained below potential in European countries, Japan and the United States. The appreciation of European currencies and the yen against the US dollar reduced
the stimulus provided by their foreign trade sectors. Unemploy
_. Ment remained at high levels in many industrialized countries. __

However, because of the fall in import prices, the average
rate of increase in consumer prices dropped to 2.2 per cent
in 1986 from 4 per ceni in:1985. The combined current
account position of the industrialized countries improved
significantly in 1986 as the deficit of $53.5 billion in 1985 was
virtually wiped out, primarily due to the favorable terms-oftrade effect of the fall in oil and other commodity prices.
Despite the appreciation of their currencies, the current
account positions of Japan and the Federal Republic of
Germany strengthened considerably although export volumes

declined and import volumes increased. The US deficit
widened despite the significant depreciation of the dollar
against the currencies of these two countries because the
favorable impact on exports took time to be realized and
imports from countries with currencies tied to the US dollar
were maintained at high levels

For developing countries as a group, the sharp decline in
commodity prices led to a fall in export earnings and slower
growth. Qil-exporting countries! were hard hit by the fall in
petroleum prices as growth faltered. the balance of payments
detenorated and inflation went up. The price of their major
export declined by almost 50 per cent and their combined
grass domestic product (GDP) declined by 0.5 per cent in
1986. They recorded an aggregate current account deficit of
$31 billion compared with a surplus of $5 billion in 1985. In
the face of falling oil revenue. the money supply showed a
rapid increase and the average inflation rate nearly doubled
to 8.3 per cent

For non-oil de veloping countries. the average GDP growth
rate declined to 3.7 per cent in 1986 from 4.4 per cent in
1985. The inflation rate fell significantly from an average of
53 per cent to 36 per cent. primarily because of the success
achieved in curbing high rates of inflation by several developing
countries in Latin America. The combined current account
deficit of the non-oil developing countries rose to $27 billion

in 1986 from $24 billion in 1985. The rise in the deficit was
less drastic than in the case of oil-exporting countries. because
the adverse effect of the fall in non-oil commodity price
dechnes was partially offset by lower prices of energy imports
Many countries also continued to restrain their imports due
lo foreign exchange constraints.

Economic Developments in DMCs

A majority of the Bank’s developing member countries
(DMCs) were able either to improve or sustain satisfactory
growth despite a fall in the prices of non-oil primary
commodities and slower growth in developed countries. With
the exception of Singapore. the newly industriahzing countries (NICs)” were able to take advantage of their enhanced
competitiveness in international markets as a result of currency
alignments to boost substantially their production and exports
of manufactured products, improve their current account
position and achieve relatively high rates of growth. Lower
oil prices and the fall in interest rates also helped to stimulate
their economies. These favorable developments enabled these
countries to reduce their debts and maintain an unusual degree
of price stability.

In Southeast Asia, economic performance was adversely
affected by low and falling commodity prices. The combined
growth rate of these countries which include Indonesia,
Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand was less than one per cent
for the second consecutive year. Indonesia and Malaysia were
hit hardest by the fail in oil prices, which severely affected both
foreign exchange earnings and government revenues. This
in turn put severe strains on government budgets and public
investment programs. In Southeast Asia, Thailand was the
least affected since lower energy prices offset lower earnings
from primary exports while the exchange rate realignment
improved the competitiveness of its non-oil exports. In all these
countries, external debt management remained a major concern and new borrowings were drastically reduced. Prices
remained relatively stable during 1986. This was particularly
remarkable for Indonesia which devalued its currency by
31 per cent during the year.

in South Asia, overall growth in 1986 was significantly
below that in the previous year. Since trade plays a relatively
minor role in their economies, overall performance was not
materially affected by the fall in the prices of primary
commodities. Indeed, the overall growth greatly depended
on agriculture, and lower growth in Burma, India and Sri
Lanka during 1986 was largely explained by relatively low
growth in this sector. The industrial sector generally performed
better due to the liberal economic environment which prevailed
in most South Asian countries during the year. Although price
increases were single digit, they were generally higher than
in 1985,

in their exports and GDPGDP Growth

“The combined GDP of 17 DMCs? rose by 6 per cent in
1986, the same increase as in 1985. The overall growth rate,
however, is greatly influenced by the inclusion of the People’s
Republic of China which sharply reduced its growth rate during
1986 from an unusually high growth rate in 1985. Excluding
the People’s Republic of China, the DMCs improved average
GDP growth to 5.6 per cent in 1986 from 3.8 per cent in
1985. :
. Of the DMCs listed in Table 1,? a majority recorded
improved GDP growth during 1986, albeit from a low level
in some cases. The NICs, which had experienced a drop in
GDP growth rates in 1985 after two consecutive years of high
economic growth, made-a robust recovery in 1986. In the
period from 1985 to 1986, the GDP growth in Hong Kong

rose to 8.7 per cent from 0.6 per cent, in the Republic of Korea __

increased to 11.4 per cent from 5.4 per cent and in Taipei,
China expanded to 9.9 per cent from 4.3 per cent. The GDP
-growth of 1.9 per cent in Singapore represented a recovery
from its 1.8 per cent decline in 1985. The dynamism of their
large export sectors was the principal factor behind these
improvements.

The overal! economic performance of Southeast Asian
DMCs was poor for the second successive year largely due
to the low prices of commodities which constitute their
principal exports. Indonesia’s 1986 GDP growth of 2 per cent
was only marginally higher than that in 1985. Lower receipts
from oil exports and the consequent cutback on public
development outlays were the principal factors. Malaysia's
1986 GDP increased by a modest 0.5 per cent after a 1 per
cent decline in 1985. Nearly all sectors suffered as the prices
of the country’s major exporis remained depressed. The GDP
of the Philippines registered marginal growth of 0.2 per cent
after suffering two consecutive declines of 5.7 per cent and
4 per cent, respectively, during 1984 and 1985. Agricultural
output increased by 3.3 per cent but industrial output fell by
3.7 per cent. Thailand’s growth record was relatively satisfactory. }ts GDP growth rate of 3.8 per cent in 1986 and 3.7
per cent in 1985 was largely due to an export boom in

manufactured goods. The loss it suffered from low-prices of---—— ----- -
agricultural exports was offset by low import prices of crude
oil and petroleum products.

The GDP growth rate of the People’s Republic of China
fell to 7.4 per cent in 1986 from 12.3 per cent in 1985. The
slowdown was the result of deliberate policy measures taken
to bring down the high trade deficit and inflation experienced
during the previous year.

In South Asia, Pakistan achieved the highest GDP growth.
its GDP increased by 7.2 per cent in 1986 and 7.4 per cent
in 1985. An impressive increase in both agricultural and
industrial production contributed to this performance. In
Bangladesh, GDP increased by 4.4 per cent in 1986
compared with 3.7 per cent in 1985. The expansion was
based on productivity gains in agriculture and higher output
of energy and non-traditional exports. Nepal’s GDP growth
rate improved to 4.2 per cent in 1986 from 3 per cent in 1985,
as both agricultural and industrial production improved. India
registered GDP growth of about 5 per cent, down from
6.3 per cent the previous year. The growth rate in agriculture
declined. However, improved incentives and liberalized
imports benefited other sectors of the economy. Burma’s GDP
growth declined to about 3.7 per cent in 1986 from 6.2 per
cent in 1985. Rice production was constrained in ‘an
increasingly competitive export market where low-quality
Burmese rice was at a discount. The country also encountered
serious financial constraints in the public sector and a widening
current account deficit. Sri Lanka’s GDP increased by about
4 per cent in 1986 compared with 5 per cent in the preceding
year. This decline was due to the depressed prices of tea and
other agricultural exports as well as the strains and interruptions caused by severe domestic political problems.

The GDP growth rates of smaller South Pacific DMCs were
generally depressed by the unfavorable prices of copra on
which depend most of their export earnings and income. Of
the two larger DMCs in the subregion, Fiji's GDP grew by
7 per cent as the economy recovered from the 3 per cent
decline in GDP in 1985 induced by cyciones and low production and prices of sugar. Papua New Guinea’s GDP grew
0.6 per cent in 1986 compared with 4.4 per cent in 1985,
mainly due to the lower prices of its traditional commodity

‘exports.

Agricultural sectors of DMCs continued to perform well in
1986 as foodgrains production cantinued to show the rising
trend of the last four years. The production of agricultural crops
for export generally increased, although revenue from export
sales declined with the low export prices of these commodities.

Cereals output in DMCs increased to 707 million tons in
1986 from 689 million tons in 1985.) The increase of
2.6 per cent exceeded the DMC population growth rate of
1.7 per cent. Rice output increased by 1.6 per cent to
419 milion tons (see Table 2). Production gains were recorded
by Bangladesh. People’s Republic of China, india, Indonesia.
Nepal and Pakisian while output declined in Afghanistan,
Burma. Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka,
Thailand and Viet Nam. The production of wheat in the DMCs
increased by 4.7 per cent to 154 million tons in 1986 from
147 million tons in 1985 (see Table 3). This was mainly due
to higher output in People’s Republic of China, India and
Pakistan and was partly offset by lower output in Afghanistan
and Bangladesh. The output of coarse grains in the DMCs
increased in 1986 by 3.8 per cent to 135 million tons. The

Among the major commercial crops of DMCs, the overall
output of coconut, palm oil, rubber and sugar increased in
1986 while that of cotton, jute and tea decreased. The
8.7 per cent growth in coconut output was largely due to the
23 per cent increase in the Philippines, the largest DMC producer. Palm oil production increased by 17.3 per cent, which
wag shared by all the DMC producers except the Philippines.
Rubber production increased by 2.1 per cent. Output
increased in People’s Republic of China. India, Indonesia,
Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam but declined
in Malaysia, the largest producer. Sugar production increased
by 5.3 per cent with higher production in People’s Republic
of China. Fiji, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, partly
offset by lower output in Bangladesh, Burma, Pakistan, Papua
New Guinea, Philippines and Sri Lanka. The output of cotton
declined by 4.3 per cent, with lower output in all major DMC
producers. The 41 per cent fall in jute was due to large declines
among the major producers, namely, Bangladesh, People’s
Republic of China and India. Tea output declined by 2.4 per
cent. All DMC producers, except the People’s Republic of
China, experienced lower output.

Industrial production rose in many DMCs during 1986. The
NICs saw manufacturing output soar with the sharp increase
in exports. Hong Kong, Republic of Korea and Taipei,China
performed best. In Singapore. manufacturing output grew
significantly following the sharp downturn in 1985.

Growth of the manufacturing sector in the People’s Republic
of China decelerated considerably to around 8 per cent from
17.5 per cent in 1985. This slowdown provided relief from
the strains produced by excessive demand on energy
resources, transportation and imports.

Among Southeast Asian DMCs, industrial production remained depressed in Indonesia and the Philippines, although
labor-intensive manufacturing activities performed better than
manufacturing in general. Malaysia and Thailand registered
some improvements in the growth of manufacturing output
as their export-oriented industries expanded.

The growth of manufacturing output in most South Asian
DMCs was higher than GDP growth because of the highincome elasticity of dernand for manufactured products. India,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka experienced higher-than-average
growth rates for the region. Bangladesh was the exception
where growth of manufacturing output during the last two
years was sluggish, partly due to a slowdown in industrial credit
disbursements to firms with substantial loan arrears.

The total output of crude oil in DMCs increased to
259 million tons in 1986 from 247 million tons in 1985 (see
Table 4}. All DMC producers of oi! except Philippines,
Taipei,China and Thailand increased output. The revenues
from oil exports received by the three oil-exporting DMCs
(People’s Republic of China, Indonesia and Malaysia),
however, fell due to the much lower average price of crude
oil in the international market.a ESTIMATED RATE OF MANUFACTURING SECTOR CHANGES IN CONSUMER PRICES

affected the economic wellbeing of the large rural populations
in several DMCs by eroding their real incomes. In 1986,
commodity prices fell further, taking some of them below the
already depressed levels in 1985. Primary commodities
exported by DMCs which witnessed a sharp drop in prices
in 1986 were copra {52 per cent), palm oi (50 per cent),
cotton (25 per cent), jute (51 per cent). tin (44 per cent) and
crude oil (49 per cent). Only prices of sugar and logs rose
during the year by 51 per cent and 11 per cent. respectively.
Despite the increase, sugar prices continued to be
unremunerative for farmers. The unfavorable commodity
prices inflicted large terms-of-trade losses on major producers
{Bangladesh. Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand).
Terms of trade improved mainly for the NICs which are major
exporters of manufactured goods and they also benefited from
the lower prices of oil.

The aggregate imports of DMCs increased by 3.7 per cent
to $222 billion in 1986 from $214 billion in 1985. The increase
was largely due to higher imports by People’s Republic of
China, Hong Kong, India, Republic of Korea, Taipei,China,
Thailand and Viet Nam. Most other DMCs had lower imports.
The decline in oil prices and consequent savings in oi] import
costs contributed to lower imports in several DMCs.

The combined international reserves of DMCs increased to
$105 billion in 1986 from $81 billion in 1985 (see Table 7).
This was equivalent to 6.8 months of imports. However, most
of this increase was accounted for by Taipei,China whose
reserves went up by $24 billion. Other DMCs which made

Domestic Savings and Investment

_ The macro aggregates — domestic savings and investment
‘inthe period 1983-85 (see Table 8) — reflect the overall level
of resource mobilization efforts by the DMCs in recent years.
The average level of investment (gross capital formation) in
DMCs ranged from 13 per cent to 44 per cent of GDP in 1985,
the latest year for which data are available. The average
domestic savings rate in DMCs varied ever. more widely —
ranging from 3 per cent to 41 per cent of GDP. Bangladesh
and Pakistan continued to be the only DMCs with domestic
savings ratios of iess than 10 per cent in 1985. In 1985,
domestic savings exceeded domestic investment in Hong
Kong, Repubiic of Korea. Malaysia and Taipe!,China. The
DMCs which financed a substantial part — more than 5 per
cent of GDP — of their investment through external assistance
included Bangladesh. People’s Republic of China, Nepal.
Pakistan and Sri Lanka. For the remaining DMCs. the gap
financed externally ranged from 0.3 per cent of GDP for the
Philippines to 3.9 per cent for Thailand.

The net flow of external resources to DMCs declined to
$11.5 biliion in 1985 from $18 billion in 1984. the latest year
....[er-which data are available (see Table 9}. Concessional flows

 

increased marginally to $7.8 billion in 1985 from $7.7 billion
in 1984 while non-concessional flows declined sharply to $3.7
billion from $10.3 billion. This reflected both the general
tightening of commercia! credit and the cautious policies of
some traditional borrowers among DMCs.

The externa! public debt of DMCs! increased by 17 per
ceni to $158 billion in 1985 from $135 billion in 1984 (see
Table 10) compared with an increase of 7 per cent the previous
year. People’s Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Republic
of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines and Thaijiand accounted for
92 per cent of the aggregate increase in external public debt.
DMCs which could reduce their external public debt during
the year were Singapore and Taipei,China

The debi-service payments of DMCs rose to $22.2 billion
m 1985 from $17.9 billion in 1984 and $15.5 billion in 1983.
The overall debt-service ratio increased to 10.8 per cent in

. 1985 from 7.5 per cemt in 1984. The debt-service ratios of

individual DMCs varied widely, ranging from 51.8 per cent
‘in Burma to 0.2 per cent for Hong Kong. Besides Burma,
debt-service ratios reached 20 per cent or more for Indonesia,
Malaysia and Pakistan. In most cases. the ratios were at
moderate levels.4

Domestic Economic Policies

Despite the difficult global economic environment, the
overall economic performance of DMCs during 1986
compared favorably with that of other regions of the world.
The relatively greater vigor and superior resilience of DMC
economies resulted from sound economic and institutional
policies pursued by them. Some of the policy initiatives and
efforts undertaken during the year are described below.

Fiscal and Monetary Policies

Fiscal policies pursued by DMCs were aimed at reducing
budgetary imbalances, stimulating the private sector and
attracting foreign investment. The thrust of resource mobilization efforts was more toward improving tax administration than
raising tax rates.

Bangladesh and India reduced marginal tax rates while
taking measures to improve tax administration. The Hong
Kong Inland Revenue (Amendment) Ordinance 1986
instituted anti-avoidance powers which yielded substantial
additional revenue to the government. Nepal withdrew
subsidies on exports and cancelled tax concessions for a
number of industries while introducing a system of auctioning licenses for certain ‘luxury’ imports as a revenue-generating
device.

 

The NICs generally pursued expansionary fiscal policies to,
combat the recessionary external influences experienced inthe previous year. Singapore undertook tax reforms aimed
at stimulating investment and increasing personal expenditure.
Republic of Korea and Taipei,China adopted measures to
increase domestic demand through higher public sector
investment expenditure. Tax reforms in Taipei.China and
Thailand were aimed at reducing the burden on households
and business corporations fo stimulate consumption and
investment.

Most DMC monetary policies were aimed at combining
economic growth with price stability. Bangladesh, People’s
Republic of China, Nepal and Philippines pursued restrictive
monetary policies to combat the relatively high rate of inflation
experienced during the preceding year. Some of them
succeeded in reducing the rate of price increases in 1986.
Republic of Korea, Hong Kong and Taipei,China increased
the availability and reduced the cost of credit in view of the
low inflation rates in these countries. However, they also took
measures to contain the excessive domestic liquidity generated
by balance-of-payments surpluses. The prevailing inflation
rates in most DMCs were below nominal returns on financial
assets; this yielded positive real interest rates conducive to
higher savings and the efficient allocation of resources. Some
DMCs with large international borrowings (Indonesia, Republic
of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand) took steps to
bring down or to arrest the growth of their foreign debt.

Investment and Trade Policies

DMCs continued with their efforts to liberalize foreign trade
and promote domestic and foreign investment. Pakistan
deregulated both domestic prices and distribution of
nitrogenous fertilizers, and the price and import controls on
edible oils. The Philippines lifted restrictions on the importation of a variety of food products and announced a
comprehensive program of tariff restructuring. India expanded
the range of products which can be manufactured by firms
in the automotive and machine tool industries and removed
restrictions on domestic capacity expansion of existing industries where the extra output would be exported. Indonesia
eliminated some of its import monopolies.

Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines,
Singapore and Thailand provided a wide range of additional
incentives to attract foreign investment. The Republic of Korea
relaxed its minimum investment limits by foreign investors in
small and medium-scale industries and increased the capital
of ihe Korea Fund, a closed-end investment company
established in the US. Taipei,China also opened its stock
market to limited foreign participation through the highly
successful flotation of a closed-end investment fund on the
New York Stock Exchange. Malaysia relaxed regulations
relating to local participation in firms established by foreign
investors. Indonesia opened areas to foreign investors hitherto
reserved for domestic entrepreneurs. The Philippines undertook to sell publicly-owned enterprises to foreign investors on
favorable terms. Singapore eased regulations which effectively
reduced labor costs for businesses in the country. Thailandreduceg income taxes on dividends and capital gains receivec
vy foreign investors from investment in mutual funds to 10 per
cent and 12.5 per cent, respectively. The London-based,
open-enc Thai Fund was established to attract portfolio investment by foreign investors in the Thai stock market and
was oversubscribed, leading to an increase in the size of the
Fund.

Reducing the large involvement of the public sector in the
directly productive acti s of the economy continued to
figure prominently in the economic policies pursued by several
DMCs. Bangladesh promulgated an industrial policy with an
improved roie for the private sector and disinvested more
government enterprises. Malaysia extended the range of
activities under consideration for privatization to include
construction and maintenance of highways and waiter supply
iacilities. Moves were also initiated to study and put into effect

 

the privatization of the Sabah Gas Utilization Project as well _
ag flotation to the. public of shares in_the_Malaysian.Interna-____

tional Shipping Corporation. The latter was successfully effected in January 1987. Indonesia initiated moves to establish
a program to review the performance of public enterprises and
to identify appropriate areas jor reform. The Philippines
created a Committee on Privatization to supervise the sale of
non-performing assets being heid by government financia! institutions anc other government corporations. Thailand conunued to implement its longer-term policy of privatization of
state enterprises and services in areas where public sector involvement is not necessary. Nepai too continued its program
of public enterprises divestiture

Exchange Rate Movements

The balance-of-payments situation of most DMCs remained
critical during 1986, although a few, mostly tne NICs,
experienced significant improvements and added to their
international reserves. Exchange rate adjustments figured quite
prominentiy as an instrument of DMC trade policies. The
People’s Republic of China devalued its currency by an
average of 16 per cent against major currencies. Indonesia
devalued its currency vis-a-vis the US dollar by 31 per cent
in recognition of the severe impact of the decline in oi! export
receipts on its economy. Fiji devalued its currency by 5 per
cent and Vanuatu by 22 per cent to improve their respeciive
balance-of-payments positions. The currencies of India and
Malaysia depreciated against the US dollar and even more
so against other major currencies. Although the currencies of
most other DMCs remained unchanged in value vis-a-vis the
US dolar or appreciated in some cases. the sharp decline in
the value of the US dollar vis-a-vis other major currencies
meant that DMC currencies tied to the US doliar also
depreciated in tandem. These developments improved the
competitiveness of DMC exports in major world marxets.

Energy Policies

The drop in oil prices provided considerable relief to oilimporting DMCs. while the People’s Republic of China.

oe

Indonesia and Malaysia were adversely affected. The saving
in energy irnports enabled a number of DMCs to iower their
domestic prices of oil and oil products. Some DMCs
{Bangiadesh, India, Pakisian anc Thailand) either kept prices
unchanged or passed on only a part of the drop in internationa! prices ana the difference accrued as additionai revenue
to their budgets.

While lower oi! prices reduced the pressure for developing
domestic energy sources and ied to increased oi! imports,
several countries continued to develop alternative sources of
comestic energy. Bangladesh continued to substitute domestic
natural gas for imported oil and oii-based products. Burma
placed priority on expioitation of its large natural gas resources
as a substitute for oil. Peopie’s Republic of China. india.
Indonesia and Thailand significantiy increased the production
of coal as an energy source. Exploration for oi! and natural
gas continued in several counties, and Bangladesh. People’s
Republic of China. India, Indonesia and Viet Nam announced
Giscoveries of hydrocarbon reserves during the year.

Regional Cooperation

Several steps were taken curing 1986 to promote regional
cooperation among DMCs. Tne Foreign Ministers of the
Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). in their
meeting at Manila in June, signed 2 petroleum security agree
 

19--—-90- -
ment. Under the terms of the agreement, the six member nations are to share regional oil production in the event-of critical
shortages caused by war or natural disaster and to buy from
the producing member couniries in cases of oversupply.

The concept of establishing an ASEAN common market
by the year 2000 was studied further by the ASEAN Economic
Ministers in Manila, Philippines, in August 1986. They agreed:
(i) to raise margins of preference on products produced under
the private sector ASEAN industrial joint venture (AlJV)
program from the present SO per cent to 75 per cent; (ii) to
approve two new AlJV projects, one to produce automobile
lamps and another for motorcycle lamps; (iii) to supplement
the cutrent ASEAN preferential trading agreement with a
“preferential tariff quota” system;! and (iv) to include at least
one ASEAN contractor in the final list of bidders for each of
the local projects financed by multilateral agencies.

The Heads of State or Government of the seven member
countries of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation {SAARC} held their second annual summit in
Bangalore, India, in November. The leaders agreed to set up
a SAARC meteorological information center in India and an
agricultural information cenier in Bangladesh. They also
agreed to establish a permanent secretariat in Kathmandu,
Nepal. Proposals for joint strategies on global economic issues
and joint collaboration in processing agricultural commodities
were discussed and will be considered further in subsequent
meetings. With the agreement on holding a meeting of
economic ministers in early 1987, SAARC moved closer to
setting up a permanent ministerial level committee for
consultation in the areas of economic, trade and industrial
cooperation.

At the South Pacific Forum meeting in Suva, Fiji, in August,
the ten member countries agreed to establish a South Pacific
Maritime Development Programme. They also pressed the
United States to conclude a fisheries agreement with the
Forum countries. Subsequently, a fishing accord was signed
by the countries concerned, and the United States is to
contribute $12 million annually for the next five years to the
South Pacific Forum. The Forum countries also established
the South Pacific Coconut Industry Federation which is to
collect and disseminate information on coconut research and
markets.

International Cooperation

In 1986, several steps were taken by the major industialized
countries to coordinate their economic policies in order to
reduce the risks and uncertainties in the global economy. One
of the first among these was concerted action to reduce official
interest rates in the early part of the year. This action, which
followed the coordinated action by the Group of Five countries
— United States, Britain, West Germany, France and Japan
— on exchange rates, reduced international interest rates to
their lowest level in eight years.

At their Tokyo summit in May, the Heads of State and
Government of the seven largest industrial countries (i) called
for an early launching of a new round of trade negotiations
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),
(i) agreed to create a new mechanism for closer coordination of policies based on several key economic indicators; and
(ili) created the Group of Seven by expanding the membership of the Group of Five to embrace Italy and Canada, for
consultations on monetary and financial matters.

In the field of international trade, preliminary steps were
taken in early 1986 for a new round of multilateral trade
negotiations. Despite the differences among the GATT
contracting parties on the agenda and procedures for negotiations, a compromise was finally reached in Punta del Este,
Uruguay, in September, with an agreement to launch the
eighth round of trade negotiations.

The agreement reached in Uruguay sought to phase out
all trade-restrictive and distorting measures inconsistent with
GATT guidelines. Further, the trade ministers agreed to: {i)
liberalize trade in agriculture by improving market access
through reduction of import barriers and create a more
competitive environment by increasing discipline on the use
of subsidies and other measures; (ii) achieve a comprehensive agreement on safequards and improve rules and
procedures of the dispute settlement process; and (iii) cover

_negotiations under the popularly-known “Uruguay Round”
began in October and are expected to be concluded within
four years.

Discussions on trade between developing countries figured
“prominently in various international fora held in 1986. In a
Cairo, Egypt meeting of the Group of Seventy-Seven in
August, delegates called for a dismantling of trade barriers
among Third World countries. Similarly, the Non-Aligned
Summit held in Harare, Zimbabwe, in September, set up a
committee to study ways for promoting South-South trade.

Jn August, the Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) was renewed
‘ for another five years. The new MFA extends its coverage
. from ‘cotton, wool and man-made fibres to silk and other
vegetable fibres like inen and ramie and also protects the
importing countries against import surges from the deveioping world. Under the broad terns of the MFA, a series of
‘bilateral agreements between the importing and exporting
counties have been concluded.

to regulate the market and merely provides the forum for

economic provisions. Under the auspices of the United

‘Nations, in October, an attempt was made to renegotiate the

Recent developments in the international economy,
mely, exchange rate reatignments, the decline in interest
ates and the continuing fall in prices of primary commodities,

 

 

including oil, affected DMCs in different ways. The impact
of these developments is likely to be felt for some time so that
the economic growth outlook of DMCs during 1987 and
beyond is rather mixed. With the passibie exception of
Singapore, the NICs are likely to experience lower growth rates
of 6 to 8 per cent. The cost advantages reaped by them from
recent developments are likely to decline while the demand
for their products in the developed countries is likely to slow
down on account of low GDP growth, protectionist pressures
and greater competition by affected countries. The adjustment
problems of Singapore are continuing and, therefore, its GDP
growth rates are expected to be around 5 per cent, much
below the country’s average growth rate in the past decade.

DMCs with a past record of high GDP growth but experiencing a slowdown (Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand) and the
Philippines, which suffered severe economic reverses during
the last few years, are expected to improve their growth per
formance. Structural adjustments begun by them should bring-—-_--——_-_-.
some positive results and some of the adverse external factors
(low commodity prices, high debt burden and large rade
deficits) may begin to ease. The adjustment process is,
however, likely to be longer for Indonesia and the Philippines
than for Malaysia and Thailand.

The People’s Republic of China and the DMCs of South
Asia with relatively jess exposure to external markets have
ridden the difficult years of the 1980s quite well, depending
largely on expansion in domestic demand for their growth.
Recent efforts in these countries to encourage the private
sector and to open up their domestic economies to external
competition and market forces will stimulate economic growth
by improving efficiency and resource allocation. Overall
growth in these counties is expected to stay around existing
levels. However, rade liberalization moves may be frustrated
by a sharp growth in current account deficits to unsustainable
levels. This could only be avoided by maintaining a commensurate growth in exports and the availability of external
resources at reasonable cost to finance current account deficits.

Background

AID effectiveness is a matter of increasing concern among both
“> donor and developing countries. The decline in recent years
in the flow of official development assistance (ODA) and in
private flows to the Bank's DMCs makes it even more important to achieve the most effective delivery and use of the
Bank's assistance to DMCs. Toward this objective the Bank
setup in 1972 an independeni systern for evaluating the performance of its development assistance. The evaiuation system
is designed to provide a comprehensive review of the Bank's
‘ operations aimed at improving the design, implementation
‘and operation of development projects and to enable the Bank
io report to its member governments on the effectiveness of
its activities. The evaluation system has been continuously
improved and refined over the years and its scope. has been
expanded to cover a broad range of Bank operations. In view
of the increasing interest in this subject, it has been considered
appropriate to explain the Bank’s evaluation system in this
year’s Annuai Report, and to highlight some of the major findings to date.

Since the Bank opened its doors 20 years ago, there has
been constant and systematic “supervision” to monitor the uses
to which Bank funds are put, to record progress and assist
_ inimplementation. Currently, 40 per cent of the time of Bank

operational staff, equivalent to about 180 work-years, is spent

each year in supervising the 400 or so Bank-assistec projects

now under implementation throughout the region. As part

of this supervision process, evaluation takes place continuously

resulting in improved impiementation procedures and
Practices.

The ex-post evaluation of projects after implementation
broadens this traditional focus of supervision from impiementation efficiency to benefit achievement. Post-evaluation
systernatically re-examines, about one to two years after comDletion of Bank-financed projects and programs, the prospects
of achieving the objectives for which the expenditures were
fitst incurred, in light of the implementation experience and
of such effects as may be visibie after completion. Deviations
from expectations in the work accomplished and its cost, duration,.and the likely socioéconomic impact are identified, their

evaluations by the Post-Evaiuation Office are vital for assessing how efiectively and efficiently Bank-financed projects and
programs are promoting the economic and social progress of
its DMCs.

In 1972, as an increasing number of Bank-assisted projects
reached completion, a program for the Bank's post-evaluation
activities was begun. Initially post-evaluation studies were
undertaken jointly by staff drawn from the Bank’s Economics
Office and the (then) Operations and Projects Departments.
In 1973, the Economics Office was made solely responsible
for this activity. On the basis of the revised arrangements. postevaluation studies were prepared by staff in the Economics

 

- Office with necessary support from short-term consultants

hired from outside the Bank, without the participation of Bank
operational staff. Subsequently, a program-for post-evaluation,
including guidelines for preparation of post-evaluaiion studies,
was approved by the Board of Directors in 1974.

As the number of compleied projects grew. the role of postevaluation in providing information for the improvement of
project design and implementation expanded. In 1977, the
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors was established;
its terms of reference included, inter alia, oversight of postevaluation activities, their adequacy and efficiency. In 1978,
the Bank’s post-evaluation activities were comprehensively
reviewed by the Audit Committee and several recommendations were made for the consideration of the Board to
strengthen the function of post-evaluation. They inciuded the
introduction of a system for preparing Project Completion
Reports (PCRs), and the establishment of procedures for the
feedback of iessons learned from post-evaluation into operational activities.

The Bank’s Evaluation System

In 1978, in ine with the Audit Commitiee’s recormmendations, the Board approved the upgrading of the PostEvaluation Unit into a separate, independent Post-Evaluation
Office (PEO), headed by a Chie! reporting directly to the President. This was intended to ensure that the PEO would have
independence of judgment. freedom of reporting its findings

 

2324

and direct access to top management. The Audit Committee
continues to monitor closely the post-evaluation process and
periodically reviews selected post-evaluation reports with
operational and PEO staff

With the establishment of PEO. a two-step evaluation
system was adopted by the Bank. The first step consists of
the preparation of PCRs by the operational divisions of the
departments responsible for the processing and implementation of the projects. For the most effective learning and impact on future operations. the initial evaluation is best carried
out by those who have been directly involved

To ensure an independent evaluation, however, the second
step consists of the preparation of Project Performance Audit
Reports (PPARs) by PEO The PPAR makes a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of a project in achieving
its objectives. and provides an analytical commentary on and
supplement to the PCR. The PPAR audits the PCR for adequacy and integrity, and focuses on specific issues meriting
closer attention. To reinforce self-evaluation by the Bank's
operational divisions and to meet accountability requirements
of its shareholders, PCRs and PPARs are prepared for all completed projects.

The PEO maintains a close working relationship with the
Bank's operational departments and offices to minimize work
duplication and ensure cost-effective and timely preparation
of PCRs and PPARs. PEO reviews draft PCRs and comments
on their completeness and presentation. Operational departments, in turn, furnish comments on PEO’s draft postevaluation reports. Substantive views on factual staternenis,
findings and conclusions, both agreeing and disagreeing, are
appropriately incorporated.

Under current procedures, the PCR focuses on the efficiency of project processing and implemeniation, describing the
history of the project and evaluating its implementation, while
the PPAR focuses on assessment of project resulis and effecliveness, assessing the physical achievements. operating performance, institutional development, socioeconomic benefits,
environmental and other impacts, including the re-evaluation
of the financial and economic rates of return where
appropriate. Abbreviated PPARs are prepared in cases where
earlier evaluations of projects implemented by the same
executing agency had not revealed substantial problems and
where the PCR for the new project indicated that no major
difficulties were encountered in its implementation and
operation.

By the end of 1986, 200 PPARs had been prepared covering 212 projects. PPARs have now been made for projects
in most of the economic sectors and in most DMCs.

In 1978, another key element of the Bank's evaluation
system was introduced: project benefit monitoring and evaluation (PBME) for rural development projects. The ongoing
supervisory role of PBME (see page 69) is built in at project
design and complements ex-post evaluation. By providing an
ongoing assessment of performance during project implementation, PBME prepares the data base for Management to adapt
project design to changes in the project environment. More
recently, PBME has extended to other sectors of Bank operations, particularly to projects which include a large component of services, as in social infrastructure.

Since 1982. with the project performance auditing system
firmly in place. PEO has also undertaken more intensive
analyses of particular issues or subjects of broader relevance
to the Bank’s operations. practices and procedures which are
frequently raised by PPARs. Special Studies have become a
particularly valuable tool for drawing and disseminating
lessons, not only in specific sectors and subsectors, but also
with regard to lending programs and the quality of sector work.

By the end of 1986, three Special Studies had been completed. The first examined the strengths and weaknesses of
Bank-organized regional training programs for development
finance institutions (DFls). The second dealt with the effectiveness of project executing agency arrangements. The third
focused on the effectiveness of project-related technical
assistance. An ongoing study is examining the effectiveness
of various types of covenants in Bank loans and is expected
to be completed during 1987. ft will list and classify loan
covenants and examine their relevance and record of compliance. as well as review the Bank’s monitoring arrangements.
make proposals to improve the formulation of loan covenants
in order to achieve project objectives and help in effective
monitoring by the Bank.

As the major objective of Bank lending is economic and
social development, the Bank’s participation in projects is
predicated on the assumption that projects will yield benefits
for a substantial period after the investment phase. While project audits address the issue of project benefits actually
generated during loan disbursement. benefits anticipated in
appraisal reports do not materialize until the operational phase.
Consequenily, since project audits are prepared shortly after
the closing of Bank loans, the full project impact may not be
realized by that time. To provide an overview of the longerterm aspect of Bank lending, PEO has initiated some secondlook studies selectively for those cases which are likely to yield
valuable insights. Such Impact Evaluation Studies usually
cover a range of projects financed by the Bank in a particular
county. Some of the projects studied might already have been
covered by a PPAR while others might not yet have been postevaluated. Other impact Evaluation Studies re-examine a
number of projects in the same sector but in different countries. These Studies provide insights into the extent to which
the benefits of Bank lending in particular sectors are sustained
and spread.

To date. PEO has completed two Impact Evaluation
Studies, The first examined Bank assistance to the fisheries
sectors in Indonesia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, reviewed the
technical, economic, financial, institutional and socio-cultural
impact of the Bank’s completed projects in marine fisheries,
and considered implications for ongoing and future projects.
The second, on the effectiveness of water usage in irrigation
projects in the Philippines, was completed in 1986. Overall.
these Impact Evaluation Studies highlighted a number of points
which could help resolve implementation problems of ongoing projects and improve the design of future projects.

The quality of post-evaluation studies depends on the active participation of all those involved. The Bank's borrowing
member countries, the beneficiaries of the Bank’s development assistance. are encouraged to participate by preparing
their own PCRs (few at present. but their number is increas-ing) and dy collaborating with and commenting on draft
PPARs and Special Studies

To maintain a continuing overview of the Gevelopment experience, including the major lessons and their implications
for the Bank and its members, PEO since 1980 has prepared
an annual Review of all PPARs and other post-evaluation
studies completed during the preceding year. The Review
analyzes, summarizes and synthesizes the findings and conclusions regarding areas wnere Bank procedures could be improved. To date, nine annual Reviews have been prepared.
Since 1982, the Review has been suomitted to the Board of
Directors by the President in conjunction with a briei report
on post-evaluation activities, outlining action taken or proposed with respect to important post-evaluation findings or
recommendations.

Some Important Findings
Evaluation of project effectiveness or impact is difficult to

make with any precision. The impact of a particular project
can be measured in several ways: by comparing post-project

BANK staff discussing a posi-evaluation report on an irrigation project in Nepal. The Post-Evaluation Office maintains a close

with pre-project data. or speculating what might have nappened if the project had not been undertaken. Except in
straighttorwarc physical terms — the iength of road added
to a country’s ransport neiwork, for instance — such comparisons have to rely on judgment drawing on past experience
and reiative performance of similar projects in different
countries

Bearing these qualifications in mind, the most important
post-evaluation finding is that over two-thirds of Bank-assisied
projects have substantially achieved their physical, institutionai
and socioeconomic objectives. Overall. projects have proviaed needed facilities and services that positively contributed
to social development and economic growth: they have
strengthened ioca! organizations and firms that provide and
maintain these facilities and services; anc they have benefited
millions of users. However, it has also been found that there
has been a iendency toward optimistic estimation of economic
internal rates of return (EIRR) at appraisal.

There are a number of reasons why some projects are more
successful than others. First, there are external factors, which
neither the Bank nor the recipient country can control.
Changes in commodity prices, market access, and exchange

 

working relationship with the Bank's operational departments and offices

rates, variations in climate, and unforeseen political events
can all have a marked effect on project performance. Second,
there are country-related factors, such as the institutional and
policy environment. Prospects for successtul implementation
and operation of projects are considerably enhanced in conducive environments or, conversely, impaired if these
environments are not consonant. Third, there are factors
connected with the projects themselves, including project
design and implementation,

Post-evaluation findings show that project design and
external factors were the most crucial to project success, with
other factors varying in effect depending on relative performance, country group and sector. Many aspects of project
preparation have been highlighted, including the need for
completion of detailed designs before appraisal for a larger
number of projects than has been the case thus far. However,
in practice, the Bank deals with a whole range of projects in
different implementation environments and one approach cannot apply to all of them. At one end are the infrastructure
projects and the civil works components in the relatively
advanced DMCs. In these. detailed preparation of the
engineering aspects leads to success because the technology
is known. Thus technical design is not a major issue. At the
other extreme are projects, including institution-building
componenis of rural and urban development schemes, which
are heavily determined by behavioral patterns about which
little may be known in advance. In such projects, design and
implementation issues predominate, and flexibility during the
project cycle is essential.

In the agriculture sector, the adoption of improved
technology is a strong factor in achieving project objectives,
with performance being improved through flexible project
design that encourages adaptive reactions to changes in the
project environment. Projects must be sufficiently well
developed to enable immediate implementation, but flexible
enough fo allow for adequate adaptation without causing
waste of resources or deferred benefits. This might require,
for example, the project to be broken up into discrete phases
or components. Only primary components would be
appraised initially, with the appraisal of subsequent activities
being dependent on a review process involving the Bank and
implementing agencies.

To respond to local needs, appropriate levels of flexibility
must be built into project design, and this will have implications for evaluation procedures. As-projects are phased to
allow for progressively increased understanding of the
behavioral response of the target population, monitoring and
evaluation will become the integrating link between design and
implementation activities. To enhance further the durability
of performance in rural development projects, PBME should
be expanded to link all stages of the project cycle including
the post-investment phase. However, PBME should be seen
as part of the process of efficient design and management and
not as an end in itself.

Project results also suggest that the outcome is dependent
on the quality of institutions responsible for operation as well
as implementation. Few projects will sustain benefit flows
unless organizations are able to carry them forward. In many
cases, institutions have been strengthened during the im
plementation process. These organizations have been able to
continue operating effectively after external support stopped.
Building organizational capacity, therefore. has become a key
element in the Bank's approach to sustaining development.

At the macroeconomic level, the formulation of county programs over the first decade of Bank operations drew heavily
from the countries’ own development plans and investment
proposals and was guided by their broad sectoral priorities.
Projects incorporated into DMC investment plans were accepted for financing subject to detailed analysis and satisfactory financial and economic rates of return. As the Bank has
become more familiar with the countries and the sectors in
the countries, its ability to develop comprehensive country
strategies and to promote and identify well-conceived project
proposals has strengthened.

Concerning the posi-evaluation process itself, experience
shows that evaluation is facilitated if the project's objectives,
planned achievements and inputs are stated in explicit and
measurable terms at the project formulation and appraisal
stage. if significant implementation issues and expected
benefits and costs of projects are systematically recorded during
the implementation period, the incremental costs of preparing PCRs and PPARs can be kept moderate; and as the
numbers of completed projects increase, some degree of selectivity in the auditing system may be warranted without jeopardizing the integrity of the audit function.

Dissemination and Follow-Up

While the principal focal point for follow-up of the findings
and recommendations of project performance evaluation has
been the preparation of the annual Review, the usefulness
of post-evaluation depends on how effectively the lessons
learned from experience identified in post-evaluation reports
are fed back into the operational system of the Bank. One
of the principal responsibilities of PEO is to follow up with
operational departments concerned (and through them the
project authorities concerned) to assess possible action to be
taken.

Post-evaluation follow-up has been systematized since
1982. An annual meeting attended both by operational and
PEO staff is convened to review and discuss the findings and
recommended follow-up actions contained in the postevaluation reports prepared by PEO during the preceding
year, and the actions taken by the operational units of the
Bank are reported in PEO's annual Review.

To ensure that findings of post-evaluation studies lead to
improved new projects, project appraisal is required to take
into account the Bank's experience with completed projects.
in addition, PEO takes part in new project processing by
reviewing and commenting on draft Board documents as well
as participating in loan processing meetings.

A computerized Post-Evaluation Information System (PEIS)
has been developed. it includes information for each audited
project covering such items as project components, costs and
loan amounts, financial and economic internal rates of return
and implementation periods at both the appraisal and the postevaluation stages. The syste also stores information on prin

veriods and rates of return and an overall assessmeni as to
whether the project was generally or only partially successful,
The system can generate statistical rables with cross tabulation
to identify significant relationships between variables. thus
facilitating analysis and evaluation of results by countries,
sectors or time series. The system is expected to be of
considerable use in providing up-to-date information for
regular or occasional reporting and research work.

To facilitate the timely dissemination of findings, PEO maintains a comprehensive reference listing of posi-evaiuation findings — a compilation of lessons learned from past projects/programs. indexed by specific stage of project cycle and
categories, sector and country. This listing is intended to help
Bank operational staff identify those aspects of past experience
which individual post-evaluation reports have note¢ as being
of more genera: and continuing interest in improving the performance of present or future Bank-funded projects and
programs

Overall. the feedback of conclusions and lessons is mainly
achieved through the presentation of PEO reports to Bank
staff ane the Board of Directors inciuding its Audit Committee, and PEO comments on project and poticy documents
To improve the system further, in 1987, senior operationai
and PEO staff will meet informally during three one-day
workshops covering different sectors jor intensive discussions
of PEO findings. their implications for Bank operations and
the efficiency of existing ieedback and foliow-up mechanisms

In recent years. there also has been a growing interest in
evaluation among bilatera: and multilateral aid agencies. The
Bank. and PEO in particular, nas remained in close touch with
these deveiopments so that experience may be shared and
cooperative efforts enhanced. For example, PEO has been
represented in coliaborative work undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development /Development Assistance Committee (OECD/DAC} Expert Group on
Aid Evaluation. In addition, comments received from cofinanciers on draft evaluative documents are reproduced as
part of these documents

The effectiveness of Bank assistance to its DMCs depends
a great deal on the management capabilities of the governments concerned. Performance evaiuation is seen as an imponant activity in assisting DMCs to improve the development

Bank lending amounted to $2.001 million in 1986. This
was lower than originally envisaged but slightly above the 1985
total of $1.908 million. Loans from ordinary capital resources
{OCR) totalled $1,368 million, representing a nominal increase of 8 per cent over the level of $1,271 million achieved
in 1985. Loans from the Asian Development Fund (ADF)

amounted to $633 million. representing a decrease of 0.6 per

cent in nominal terms over the 1985 level of $637 million.
The lower-than-programmed lending level reflected various
factors. Overall, the impact of falling oil prices benefited the
balance-of-payments position of most developing member
countries {DMCs}. but the adverse impact in oil-exporting
DMCs led to cutbacks in planned investments. The fall in com“Modity Prices continued io depress export earnings for many

In addition, many DMCs have built up a high level of external debt and are pursuing more prudent borrowing policies.
Together, these factors have adversely affected the capacity
of most DMCs to increase development financing and accelerate project implementation.

In some DMCs, development has been adversely affected
by budgetary constraints, while in others political considerations have had a similar effect. Delays in resolving policyrelated issues also hindered project processing in some DMCs.

In 1986, the Bank approved Special Project Implementation Assistance loans totalling $130.6 million — to the
Philippines ($100 million) and Indonesia ($30.6 million). The
loans will finance local currency requirements of high-priority
ongoing Bank-financed projects, implementation of which has
been-delayed due to shortage of local currency resources. In
the Philippines, a total of 36 projects in key areas such as
agriculture, irrigation, water supply. transport, education and
energy will be assisted. In Indonesia, the loan will help in the
expeditious implementation of six ongoing education projects.

In addition to the Bank’s lending operations, the Bank approved three equity investments totalling $3.2 million:
$2.14 million to finance a major expansion of the Cherat
Cement Company, Ltd. (Pakistan). $0.495 million to Planters
Deveiopment Bank (Philippines) and $0.52 million to
Northeast Agriculture Company, Ltd. {Thailand}. A further
line of equity was approved for $5 million to the National
Development Finance Corporation and Bankers Equity Ltd.
in Pakistan. These raised total cumulative equity approvals
to $15.2 million since the Bank began equity financing in
1983,

During the year, 52 loans were approved for 48 projecis
in 19 BMCs. This compares with a total in 1985 of 48 loans
approved for 46 projects in 13 DMCs. “Blended” loans
financed from both OCR and ADF were provided for four
of the 1986 projects — the Second Agricultural Development
Bank and the Agricultural Inputs Program loans in Pakistan,

The average size of loans decreased marginally in 1986 to
$38.5 million from an average of $39.8 million in 1985. The
average size of OCR loans was little changed at $50.7 million
in 1986 compared with $50.8 million in 1985. The average
size of ADF loans decreased to $25.3 million from
$27.7 million in the previous year.

DMCs: Indonesia ($319.1 million), India ($250 million),
Malaysia ($105.2 million), Republic of Korea ($53 million),

comprising $266.8 million from OCR and $50 million from

As in 1985, the constraints on overall Bank lending in 1986
were also reflected in its co-financing activities. The amount

of co-financing by official and commercial sources in Bankassisted projects decreased to $492 million from $640 million
in 1985. Continued constraints on borrowing by member
countries as well as the relatively small size of projects limited
the need to seek additional resources from co-financiers.

special assistance, program and sector loans — had a total
estimated cost of $5 billion, 40 per cent of which was accounted for by Bank financing, 50 per cent was to be provided by borrowing DMCs and 10 per cent was to be provided
by co-financiers.

Local cost financing in 1986, exclusive of Special Project
Implementation Assistance loans, amounted to $267.5 million
for 23 projects in 11 DMCs. OCR provided $130.2 million
of this amount, and ADF $137.3 million. representing 9.5 per
cent and 21.7 per cent, respectively, of OCR and ADF loans
approved during the year.

The Bank's cumulative lending by the end of 1986 had
reached $19.5 billion for 746 projects in 28 DMCs of which
$13.3 billion was from OCR and $6.2 billion from ADF.
About $1.7 billion was provided for local cost financing.

Technical Assistance .

The Role of Technical Assistance and
Its Funding

Technical assistance continues to play an important role in
the Bank’s operations. Its main function is to facilitate the
transfer of resources and technology to DMCs by assisting
them to design. formulate, implement and operate development projects efficiently and effectively. In addition, technical
assistance is used to enhance DMC capability to formulate
economic development policies, strategies. programs and
plans to improve the allocation of scarce domestic and external resources.

Following a recent review of the Bank's technical assistance
operations, increased emphasis is now being placed on
technical assistance for: (i) institutional development, particularly in the less and least developed DMCs; {ii} meeting
other needs of these countries and the srnall island DMCs;
(ii) studies of broad and sectoral policy and other issues which
may complement the Bank’s evolving operational strategy in
each DMC or enhance its role as a regional Development
Resource Center; and (iv) efforts to improve regional
cooperation.

Technical assistance activities are financed by the Bank
through grants and loans and combinations of both. Funding
sources available for grant-financed technical assistance activities comprise: (i) voluntary contributions to the Technical
Assistance Special Fund (TASF) from both developed and
developing member countries; {ii} grant funds provided by
other multilateral and bilateral sources under co-financing and
exclusive financing arrangements; (iii) allocation to TASF from
the fourth ADF replenishment; and (iv) income from the
Bank’s OCR.

Funding sources for loan-financed technical assistance are

GIS sel cishe eeehe Bank's OCK: and ADF resources, together with other
.. “qultilateral and bilateral sources under co-financing and exclusive financing arrangements.

Total Volume of Technical Assistance

By the end of 1986. the Bank’s technical assistance had

been provided for 1,554 projects and regional activities in 28
DMCs, and had totalled $1.6 billion. Of that assistance, about

76 per cent was financed by Bank loans and 16 per cent by

= grants financed by the Bank and other sources but executed
“by the Bank. The remaining 8 per cent was financed and
executed by other sources under co-financing arrangements.

For most of its technical assistance projects financed from
other sources, the Bank acts as executing agency. Such projects-were financed in 1986 by agencies including the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Governments of Norway and Switzerland. For the preparation of

. agricultural projects, the Bank also continued to cooperate
with the Food and Agriculture Organization/Investment Centre (FAO/IC) {see Table on page 148).

As of the end of 1986, 40 per cent of cumulative technical
assistance to DMCs had been provided to Group A (low
income) DMCs, 51.5 per cent to Group B (middle-income)

. DMCs and 8.5 per cent to Group C (higher income) DMCs.
Among Group A DMCs, 22 per cent of the total amount of
_ technical assistance provided went to the seven leastdeveloped countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Lao
PDR, Maldives, Nepal and Western Samoa). One per cent
of the total went to Group A DMCs in the South Pacific {Cook
islands, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu). The
share of Group A DMCs has increased from about 19 per cent
during 1967-72 to about 40 per cent during 1981-86 while
the share of Group B DMCs has remained constant at about
90 per cent and the share of Group C DMCs has declined
‘to.about 10 per cent during 1981-85 from 29 per cent during
1967-71,
»s, The sectorai distribution of the total amount of technical
‘assistance provided to DMCs during 1967-86 is 40 per cent
‘to.agriculture and agro-industry, 18 per cent to the energy
Sector, 20 per cent to social infrastructure, 15 per cent to
transport and communications, 5 per cent to industry and nonfuel minerals, including development finance institutions
" (DFls), and 2 per cent to the multisector and others. The share
of the agriculture and agro-industry sector declined to 32 per
cent during1982-86 from 53 per cent during 1967-71 while,
over the same period, the share of the energy sector increased
to 21 per cent from 7 per cent, the share of the transport and
communications sector declined significantly to 14 per cent
from 33 per cent, and the share of the industry and non-fuel
minerals sector {including DFls) increased from 4 per cent to
& per. cent.

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
    
  
  
  
 

 

 

Grant-Financed Technical Assistance

In 1986, technical assistance grants approved by the Bank
(funded by the Bank and other sources} amounted to $38.6
Taillion for 134 projects including regional activities.

.. This compares with $34 million for 112 projects approved in

 

1985, and brought the cumulative total to $242 million. The
increase in volume in 1986 reflected increased utilization of
relatively large technical assistance projects for institution
building and project implementation, while the increase in
number largely reflected the extension in 1986 of a small-scale

{up to $75,000) technical assistance facility to advisory and *

operational as weli as regional technical assistance projects.
Of the 1986 total amount. 60 per cent was provided for
advisory and operational purposes, 21 per cent for project
preparation and 19 per cent for regional activities.
Seventy-one per cent, or $22 million of the total amount,
of technical assistance grants to DMCs in 1986 went to,countries fully eligible for ADF loans. These were Bangladesh,
Bautan, Burma, Kiribati, Lao PDR, Maidives, Nepal, Pakistan,
Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Tonga, Vanuatu and Western
Samoa. The rest, amounting to $9.2 million, went to People's Republic of China, Fiji, Indonesia, Republic of Korea,

The agriculture and agro-industry sector retained the largest

share of the total amount of grant-financed technica! assistance

The total technical assistance amount included technical
assistance grant components amounting to $17.5 million approved in conjunction with 22 Bank loan projects of which
$16.3 million was for advisory and project implementation
purposes and $1.2 million for project preparation.

The importance of technical assistance to the Bank’s overall
lending program is highlighted by the fact that, as of the end
of 1986, 327 Bank loan projects amounting to $8.9 billion
had resulted from earlier project preparatory technical
assistance grants amounting to $65 million (the total amount
of project preparatory technical assistance approved was $231
million). Taking 1986 alone, 31 Bank loan projects totalling
$1,104 million resulted from earlier technical assistance. Of
this amount, $676 million came from OCR and $428 million
from ADF, representing 49 per cent and 68 per cent, respectively, of total loans approved during the year from these
sources,

Regional technical assistance grants in 1986 increased to
$7.4 million for 33 projects from $5.5 million for 32 projects
in 1985. During the year, 22 per cent of the total amount
for regional activities went to regional studies and workshops,
25 per cent for conferences and seminars, 33 per cent for training and 20 per cent for research and other activities.

In 1986, 106 grant-financed technical assistance projects
were completed. This brought the total number of such
projects completed to 650.

Loan-Financed Technical Assistance

Since Bank operations started in 1967, loan-financed
technical assistance amounting to $1.3 billion had been provided for 590 projects by the end of 1986. Of this amount,
59 per cent was funded from’ OCR, representing 6 per cent

PR

of cumulative OCR lending, 31 per cent from ADF, representing 7 per cent of cumulative ADF lending and the balance
from other sources. About $128 million of the total amount
of loan-financed technical assistance was provided as separate
technical assistance loans for project preparation activities.
Some $49 million was provided from project loan financing
during project implemeniation for advisory activities such as

‘ institutional strengthening and training. About 86 per cent of

the total, or about $1.1 billion, was provided from project loan
funds for project implementation activities — mainly consu!tant services — to assist in the implementation, operation and
management of a project. These services included evaluation
of bids, construction supervision, training of local personnel
and the improvement of the implementation capability of project entities.

During 1986, technical assistance components of loans

‘included $6.8 million for project preparation activities and

about $84 million for project implementation and advisory
technical assistance activities, a decrease of 51 per cent and
37 per cent. respectively, over the unusually large amount

Training Activities

‘Recognizing that the development of human resources is
crucial to socioeconomic development in the developing
- member countries, the Bank continues to emphasize this as
~ the most durable’ basis for economic progress. Training for
* skill development is the principal vehicle of such efforts. In
* addition, there is strong support for education to create the
necessary knowledge base.
- Of the 48 loan projects approved in 1986, 31 were either
Yo "wholly tor education/training or had training components
_ totalling $141.8 million. Training components were selectively
built into project schemes in all sectors, in some cases to assist
‘the implementing authorities in executing the project effectively, and in others to serve the longer-term purpose of
’S enhancing their institutional capacity. The Highland Livestock
“Project in Bhutan, for example, had a training component
“amounting to $670,000 to assist implementation while the
‘Malaysian Health Services Project had a $4.3 million training:component to enhance the institutional capacity of the
health ‘sector.
“, Several methods are employed for training DMC personnel. They include offering fellowships for specific studies in
countries with appropriate training arrangements (one example
vof this in 1986 was the Second Road Improvement Project
in Lao PDR which contained a substantial fellowship training
component); engaging specialist consultants either to conduct
on-site training courses {as in the Karachi Urban Development
_ Project in Pakistan, also approved in 1986} or to work with
host country staff and initiate a process of on-the-job trainAng; arranging study or observation tours for technical staff
{as in the Azolla Research and Development Project in the
Philippines, for which the Bank approved technical assistance
in 1986); and prescribing collaborative arrangements between
_ @xpatriate and domestic consultants to ensure a steady transfer
of technology during the project. All these types of training
Were integrated into the Irrigated Command Area Development Project in Indonesia and the Second Aquaculture
Development Project in Nepal, both of which were approved
by the Bank in 1986.
_ Atotal of $5.3 million was provided for training components
+N project preparatory, and advisory and operational technical
_ assistance projects during the year. Technical assistance was
widely used to ascertain institutional, educational and man, Power, weaknesses in DMCs, and design a training response

 

  
  
  
    
    
  
   
  

 

 

tailored to meet them. For exampie, the Second Road Project in the Solomon Islands, for which the Bank provided
technical assistance in 1986, was designed to determine,
among other things, the training needs of that sector. In some
cases, technical assistance was also used to review and
evaluate past training inputs and so improve future design
work in the field. In this context, the Betio Shipyard Improvement Project in Kiribati, for which the Bank provided supplementary technical assistance in 1986, was implemented
to determine the future training needs in the ship industry.

Seminars and workshops, undertaken as regional technical
assistance, constituted the other major area of the Bank’s training activities (see page 151). Training components in such
seminars and workshops totalled $3.9 million. A number of
these were designed to raise the standard of development
management in the region; for example, two regional technical
assistance projects provided training programs which focused
on raising the development management ability of senior
managers in development finance institutions in Asia and the
South Pacific. Another regional technical assistance enabled
key decision makers from various DMCs to participate in the
Regional Training in Community Forestry, which focused on
the clarification of critical sectoral issues in forestry. In addition, seminars on procurement, use of consultants and project implementation management were conducted in six
DMCs.

In recent years there has been an increase in the number
of training-related projects in the education sector. Some address central manpower issues in the DMCs, while others seek
to provide an educational base — in major areas such as
agriculture, engineering or basic science/technical education
— for creating the skills necessary for economic growth. Two
projects for which the Bank approved loans in 1986 illustrate
this. In Indonesia, the Ministry of Public Works Manpower
Education and Training Project, for which the Bank approved
a $29 million loan, will provide overall in-service training for
site engineers employed by the Ministry. In the Republic of
Korea, the Marine Sciences Education Project, for which a
$53 million loan was approved, will provide basic education
in the marine sciences.

Sectoral Review

Three sectors sharply increased their share of Bank lending
in 1986 — agriculture and agro-industry, which soared to
41 per cent of total lending from 29 per cent in 1985, energy.
which doubled its share to 26 per cent from 13 per cent a
year earlier, and multisector, which rose to over 5 per cent
from 0.4 per cent in 1985. On the other hand, social
infrastructure, which had the second largest share in 1985 with
28 per cent, fell to less than 14 per cent, while the shares
of transport and communications, with 9 per cent compared
with 16 per cent in 1985, and industry and non-fuel minerals,
including development banks, with 5.5 per cent compared
with 13 per cent in 1985, were also considerably reduced.

Lending to the agriculture and agro-industry sector (which
covers irrigation and rural development, fisheries, livestock,
agricultural credit and support services, foresiry, fertilizer and34

agro-processing) increased to $822 million from $559 million
a year earlier. reflecting the continuing high priority assigned
both by the DMCs and the Bank to agricultural development.

In irrigation and rural development, the thrust of Bank lending in 1986 was directed towards helping increase or stabilize
food crop production, generate rural employment and
improve farmers’ incomes. particularly in the less developed
areas in DMCs, and conserve foreign exchange. Greater
emphasis continued to be placed by the Bank and the DMCs
on the fuller utilization of existing irrigation facilities and
promoting crop diversification. Means of achieving these
objectives included the financing of agricultural inputs
programs in Pakistan and Sri Lanka to sustain the production
of food crops; the rehabilitation of drainage and flood control
systems in the Khulna area in Bangladesh to restore land
productivity devastated by floods: command area development in Indonesia to derive maximum benefits from existing
irrigation facilities: support for the production of vegetables
and other cash crops fogether with marketing improvement
in the Philippines and Fiji; and the introduction of new trickle
irrigation techniques in Baluchistan, Pakistan, to make the
most effective use of scarce irrigation water for fruit growing

Advisory assistance was provided to Lao PDR and
Sr Lanka to help develop their institutional capacity in
planning. implementation and management of irrigation and
rural development projects. Other Bank assistance was
provided to Bhutan, Papua New Guinea and Philippines to
study specific agricultural issues of strategic importance and
a regional seminar on irrigation service fees was held, A report
on an internal review of the Bank's operations in the irrigation subsector during 1966-85, undertaken in 1985, was published in 1986.

The accelerated development of Asia’s significant potential for expanded fish and shrimp production, for both domestic
consumption and export, from aquaculture received increased
emphasis with the approval of loans for this purpose to
Bangladesh, Nepal and Thailand. Strong emphasis was also
given to improving the production, productivity and utilization of selected industrial crops with the approval of loans to
Burma (oilseeds), Indonesia {palm oil) and Pakistan (cotton):
export market considerations figure prominently in the latter
investment while the Burma and Indonesia loans focus on fill
ing expanding domestic requirements. Cotton. as well as tea
and grains, received additional attention in the form of Bank
funding of investment studies involving these commercial crops
in Bangladesh, Nepal and Burma, respectively. Involvement
in and support for the private sector and smallholders was
a prominent element in all the investments noted above, as
well as in a loan to the Agricultural Development Bank of
Pakistan and in the Bank's first loan to Bhutan for livestock
development.

Support for DMC efforts to rationalize and diversify resource
utilization and to resolve constraints to resource development
was also a major thrust of Bank assistance to the sector in
1986. A loan and technical assistance in Sri Lanka and Nepal,
respectively, are to help upgrade land use planning capabilities
in those countries. Detailed assessments of the livestock and
fisheries subsectors in Pakistan and the tea industry in Nepal.

in 1986, forestry development will also be studied in Pakistan.
as will opportunities and investments in crop diversification
in Sri Lanka. Forestry conservation and development, and
soil management will be the focus of attention in regional
workshops supported by the Bank. The Bank will also help
establish a Regional Community Forestry Training Cenier in
Thailand with co-financing from the Government of
Switzerland. These efforts, as well as support for certain activities of established regional institutions, such as the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, demonstrate
the continuing emphasis by DMCs and the Bank on wise
resource utilization and environmental considerations.
There was a substantial-increase in assistance to the energy
sector during 1986. Loans amounted to $515 million compared with $245 million in 1985. Load growth continued to
be lower than anticipated in the power subsector despite some
improvement in the economic growth rate in some DMCs,- Multisector

and Bank assistance was provided largely for improving the

* quality and reliability of the power supply in many DMCs

through the rehabilitation and construction of transmission and
distribution lines. The first loan to the power sector in India

. also contributed substantially to the increase in 1986. A review

 

 

of investment needs of the power subsector over the period
1986-90 initiated by the Bank has indicated that substantiai
investments will need to be made by the DMCs to rehabilitate
or provide additional generating capacity and transmission and
distribution lines in order to meet the growing demand for
Power and to improve the quality and reliability of power supPlies. As the Bank’s share of total investments in the power
subsector of the DMCs is only about 10 per cent, there is scope
for increasing Bank assistance in the future.

Bank lending for the social infrastructure sector fell to
$272 million in 1986 from $544 million a year earlier. Within
this sector, lending for urban development and housing
declined considerably from 1985 levels with only one loan
approved, for the Karachi Urban Development Project in
Pakistan. ‘

Theimprovement of water supply and sanitation facilities

is of critical importance to the health and socioeconomic progress of Asia. The Bank's financing in this sector in the past
has been mainly in expanding water supply and sanitation
facilities in the major cities. However. Bank financing is shifting from major urban projects towards those serving the needs
of smaller provincial towns and rura! areas. Emphasis is also
being placed on the rehabilitation of existing facilities to reduce
water losses. During 1986, the Bank approved loans to the
Philippines and Sri Lanka for water supply projects.

In 1986, the recent trend in education away from formal
vocational education projects continued with the first wholly
in-service training project for the Ministry of Public Works,
Indonesia and the Marine Sciences Education Project in the
Republic of Korea. A loan was also provided to meet part of
the local cost of ongoing education projects in Indonesia.
Seven technical assistance approvals — four project
preparatory, one advisory and operational, and two regional
— were processed. Additionally, two regional technica!

~~ ~assistance projects were successfully implemented. The first,

a Regional Workshop on Training for Entrepreneurship and
Self-Employment, attracted participants from 19 DMCs and
the second, a Seminar on Distance Education, focused on
possible future development in this field in the Asia and Pacific
region.

In 1986, continuing its primary focus on improvement of
health facilities, the Bank approved its first ever health sector
loan to Malaysia to finance part of its Fifth Malaysia Plan health
sector activities. Technical assistance activities in the sector
included assistance to Pakistan to prepare a project to improve
health services in Baluchistan and the Northwest Frontier Province. In addition, and particularly relevant to the resource
constraints being experienced in this sector due to the sharp
economic downturn in the xegion, the Bank approved
technical assistance thai will help Malaysia establish a National
Health Security Fund, and assistance to help organize a
regional seminar on exploring alternative mechanisms for
additional resources for health care financing.

Bank lending for the transport and communications sector
amounted to $179 million in 1986 compared with $310
mijlion in 1985. In the airports and highways subsector, loans
were approved for the Roadworks Mechanization Project in
Bhutan, three road improvement projects in Lao PDR, Nepal
and Philippines, and for an airport project in Nepal. The emphasis of Bank lending on road improvements reflecis the
substantial traffic growth in many DMCs which has frequently surpassed the original capacity of the roads. At the same
time, traffic composition has also changed with an increasing
share of heavier vehicles for which the roads were not
designed. In conjunction with the loan projects. the Bank has
granted technical assistance focusing on strengthening the
institutions responsible for road planning, construction and
maintenance. In order to ensure adequate future maintenance
of roads and efficient allocation of resources in this sector,
the Bank has entered into extensive policy dialogue with the
agencies in the governments concerned with road transport
which center on pricing of transport infrastructure and services as well as financing of road construction and maintenance
budgets. In 1986, the Bank provided the Eighth Port Project
loan to heip upgrade the facilities of two ports in Kalimantan,

indonesia {Banjarmasin and Balikpapan). In addition,
technical assistance was granted for strengthening the institu tional and operational capabilities of the executing agencies.
in order to assist the Government of Tonga in implementing
a package of small but high priority subprojects relating primarily to the transport and communications sector, the Bank approved the third Multiproject loan, including a technical
assistance grant to finance consulting services to prepare and
appraise these subprojects.

Lending to the industry and development banks sector
declined substantially to $110 million from $243 million in
1985. This fall is attributable to such factors as the reduced
number of requests for credit lines because of the continuing

- recession in several DMCs and the access that certain develop
ment finance institutions (DFIs) had to the international capital
market for borrowing at competitive rates. While the Bank
continued to provide credit lines to DFis as a means of supporting the private sector (for further information, see next
column), assistance for industry was mainly focused on the
provision of grant-financed project preparatory technical
assistance for the development of industrial sites and estates.

Private Sector Assistance Activities

During 1986, the Bank launched a new lending program
designed to enlarge and diversify its support for private enterprises in DMCs by introducing direct lending to private enterprises and financial institutions without government
guarantees. In view of the associated risks and uncertainties,
such loans are envisaged not to exceed about $75 million from
OCR and $25 million from ADF during the first two years of
operation. These loans, to be provided on terms comparable
to those of similar loans from commercial sources, will finance
up to 25 per cent of total project costs and enable borrowers
to mobilize additional funding from other foreign and domestic
sources.

A new Private Sector Division was established in the Bank
early in the year to facilitate such lending and to act as a focal
point for all the Bank's private sector operations. Staff missions were sent to several DMCs to promote awareness of
the Bank's new facility and to identify appropriate lending opportunities. In general, responses to these initiatives have been
quite encouraging and, to facilitate commencement of such
lending in their countries, several DMC governments have extended the general assurances sought by the Bank with regard
to its right to repatriate, free of tax, payments arising from
these operations.

Three loans without government guarantees totalling
$11.46 million were approved during the year — in Pakistan,
$5 million for expanding a cement plant and a credit line of
$5 million to a leasing company arid in Thailand, $1.46 million
to a food processing company.

The loans té the cement company in Pakistan and the food
processing company in Thailand were combined with equity
investments of $2.14 million and $0.52 million, respectively. The Bank was already a shareholder in the Pakistani leasing company. Aside from these two new equity investments,
the Bank approved an investment of $0.5 million in the equity
of a private DFI in the Philippines, as well as an umbrella equity
line of $5 million to two DFls in Pakistan. These will facilitate
Bank support for relatively small private enterprises with DFI
co-financing as well as assist in project selection and supervision. The four equity investment projects approved during the
year aggregated $8.15 million, raising to $15.18 million the
cumulative equity approvals since the Bank commenced equity financing in 1983. The Board approved during the year
a further allocation of $25 million from OCR for equity investment operations beyond the initial allocation of
$10 million.

The Bank assisted the Governments of Fiji and Western
Samoa with technical assistance grants amounting to
$656,500 for studying the possibilities of privatizing some
public enterprises.

Most of the Bank’s assistance to the private sector, however,
continued to be channelled through credit lines to DFls. Of

 

 

Hits. abanso such credit lines aggregating $101 million approved during
__ the year, one, of $100 million, was extended to a DFI in India
” for onlending to medium-size private enterprises for expanding and modernizing capacity, enhancing productivity and
technological development. This was the Bank’s first loan to

India. A second credit line of $1 million was provided to a

- DFl in Tonga for financing relatively small productive private.
enterprises. With these two credit lines, the cumulative amount
of such lending since the Bank’s inception reached just over
$2 billion to 31 DFls in 20 DMCs. In addition, as part of its
institution-building efforts, the Bank approved a technical
assistance grant of $75,000 to help a DF] in the Philippines
to set its portfolio in order, and another technical assistance
grant of $160,000 to the DFI in Tonga to improve its institu- °
tional capabilities.

Aside fromthe funding and institution building of specific
DFis,.the Bank in its financial sector operations broadened
its range to cover the various aspects of DMC financial systerns_
that concern the expanded availability of long-term capital and
related financial services to private enterprises. Since equipmeni leasing is emerging as an increasingly popular technique
for asset financing, the Bank carried out a study of leasing
in seven DMCs, namely, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Republic of
Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Similarly, a study of the potential for venture capital financing in
DMCs was also carried out during 1986 in Indonesia,
Malaysia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The final reports
‘on these studies are expected to be available early in 1987.
Furthermore, a fresh technical assistance grant of $71,000
was approved during the year to finance a study of the capital
“market in Fiji.

 

  
  
  
  
   

Co-Financing

A total of 23 Bank projects was co-financed in 1986, the
same number as in 1985. The contributions of co-financiers
decreased to $492 million from $640 million in 1985 while
“the Bank’s contribution fell to $752 million from
$1,024 million. As of the end of 1986, 219 Bank projects
had involved co-financing, with co-financiers providing about
», $5.8 billion and the Bank $7.8 billion.

-... Co-financing, being closely linked to the Bank’s overall
lending operations, had another difficult year in the light. of
domestic resource constraints, heavy debt service burdens and
low primary commodity prices which continued to depress
economic growth in most DMCs and thus reduce demand for
investment resources. Owing to these factors, development
Projects in most DMCs were cut back and additional resources
normally associated with co-financed projects were reduced.

Co-financing is attractive for sectors like energy, industry
and development banks where additional resources are always
welcomed as these projects are normally quite self-liquidating
financially. As in 1985, lending to these sectors by the Bank
was relatively quiet in many of the DMCs, which in turn
affected the demand for co-financed resources.

Co-financing from official sources continues to be popular,
owing to the concessionality introduced into projects by these

.. Hesources. As a result, the Bank stepped up its efforts in

 

mobilizing concessionary assistance from official co-financing
sources. Bilateral sources, such as Australia, Japan, Norway,
Sweden and United States, provided $144 million in respect
of six projects, and multilateral sources — the World Bank
Group. European Economic Community (EEC), European
Investment Bank, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Islamic Development Bank, OPEC Fund and
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) — provided $235 million for 17 projects. The Bank co-financed with
the Nordic Investment Bank for the first time in a project in
Indonesia.

Co-financing with export credit/commercia! sources declined to $113 million in respect of four projects compared with
$305 million for five projects in 1985, A complementary
financing scheme from cornmercial sources was being organized for a project in Bangladesh for cost-overrun financing
of the construction of a fertilizer complex. Export credits were

Development Resource Center
Activities

During the year, the Bank further strengthened and expanded its role as a development institution providing information
and training with a view to strengthening institutions and
policies in the DMCs.

in addition to overall policies, governmental systems and
procedures in the DMCs have direct relevance to the effective implementation of Bank-assisted projects. Bank missions
discussed streamlining existing systems and procedures and
overall policies and problems with ministers and senior officials
in several DMCs. Regional and country seminars were sponsored to enhance domestic capability to implement projects.
Symposia were also organized on the development of national
consultants and improving their competitiveness in the international market, on procurement practices and on matters
relating to executing agencies for agricultural projects.

With a view to further streamlining operations, the Bank
published handbooks on the management of project implementation, on problems of procurement for projects
financed by the Bank, on uses of consultants and on sample
bidding documents for supply, delivery and installation of
goods. The proceedings of a regional seminar on irrigation
service fees was also published to assist policymaking in this
difficult field.

Regional cooperation in energy in the Pacific Economic
Cooperation Conference was strengthened by Bank assistance
for data collection and further research. A regional meeting
on energy policy was convened after the completion of indepth studies of the energy policies of nine DMCs,

The Bank continued its research into areas of relevance to
policymaking in the DMCs and into strategy studies for Bank
operations. It also regularly published the Key Indicators of
DMCs of ADB, the Economic Report Series and the Bank
Staff Papers and Statistical Report Series with a view to widely
disseminating the results of Bank research (see page 175).
The Asian Development Review also continued to provide

~ a semi-annual forum for contributors, both from within and

from outside the Bank.

Technical workshops were held in Manila, Philippines, for
studies on Foreign Barriers to DMC Exports, on Financing
Public Sector Development Expenditure and on Informal
Credit Markets. These are being undertaken in collaboration
with research institutes in the DMCs. Preparatory work also
began on projects for the Improvement of National Accounts
in four South Pacific DMCs, for the Construction of Quarterly National Accounts in Indonesia and for an ADB/ESCAP
Workshop on the International Comparison Project.

During the year, the Bank continued to promote Tegional

cooperation by granting technical assistance for a wide Tange-
of regional activities covering such diverse subjects as distance
education, soi] management and health care finance (for fur.
ther details, see page 151).

Regular collaborative training programs and seminars continued during the year with the Asian Productivity Organiza.
tion/ADB training course in Project Feasibility Appraisal and
Implementation and the Asian-Pacific Bankers Club Symposium on Industrial Analysis in the Twenty-First Century;
Some Guidelines for APBC Members.

The ADB Development Round Table, which has annually
brought together senior policymakers and eminent resource
persons from the Bank’s member countries, was convened
for the fourth consecutive year. The theme in 1986 was “Trade
Liberalization and Development”. .

Preparatory work was undertaken during the year for the
1987 ADB/East-West Center Symposium on Regional
Cooperation in South Asia.

iBenefits to the Poor

The Bank’s approach to poverty alleviation has traditionally
emphasized economic growth and the efficient use of
resources. This approach has contributed to the creation of
numerous employment opportunities and higher average
incomes, and has helped make additional revenues available
for governments to invest in improving the welfare of the
poorest. However, conditions of absolute poverty have persisted and the number of people experiencing these conditions has increased despite the beneficial impact of economic

ee growth and the substantial progress on such indicators as life

“expectancy, literacy and infant mortality achieved by most
DMCs. In recognition of this, the Bank, while continuing to
“-focus on projects which would promote growth, and while

adhering to its criteria for determining economic viability of

ductivity of the poorest farmers; expand physical infrastructure in regions of DMCs which were less developed; and pro

projects, has financed projects which aimed to raise the pro-.

vide improved health, sanitation and water facilities where
these services were not previously available.

The Bank's efforts in 1986 to contribute to poverty alleviation in DMCs focused on meeting the ongoing needs for investment in projects aimed at raising income levels and improving the quality of life of the poor over the medium to long
term. Bank loans for these projects will finance a wide array
of economic activities and social services and include
agricultural production, irrigation, rural development.
aquaculture, livestock, agro-industries, water supply and urban
development.

Small farmers and landless peasants are among the principal anticipated beneficiaries of seven Bank-financed projects
for agricultural production, irrigation, livestock and rural
development in seven DMCs (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia,
Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines and Sri Lanka). As
estimated during appraisal of these projects, about 90,000

generally low-income families would realize increased employ:-—_

ment and higher incomes as a result of these projects. For
example, it is estimated that 31,000 families, many of them
landless, almost all the others small farmers, will benefit fom
the Khulna Coastal Embankment Rehabilitation Project in
Bangladesh.

Two aquaculture projects (in Bangladesh and Nepal) are
expected to generate additional employment opportunities in
rural areas, help diversify the productive base of the respective economies and improve food supplies. The project in
Bangladesh is intended to create an additional 52,000 jobs
exclusive of the casual labor used at harvest time. Under the
Bank-assisted project in Nepal, 8,000 additional jobs are expected to be created.

Significant improvements in the physical quality of life of
the poor are expected to be among the principal benefits arising from three projects financed by the Bank in 1986. The
Island Provinces Rural Water Supply Sector Project in the
Philippines has been designed to bring safe drinking water to
some 1.2 million people spread throughout the country. Mortality and morbidity rates are expected to decline, particularly among young children as exposure to water-bome, waterrelated and parasitic diseases is reduced. In Sri Lanka, a large
proportion of the benefits from the Bank-financed Water
Supply Sector Project is expected to accrue to low-income
people. Much the same health benefits as those in the
Philippines are anticipated from this project as well. The Bank
also approved a loan to Pakistan for the Karachi Urban
Development Project which has been designed to improve
living conditions throughout Karachi, particularly in its low
" income areas. The project includes improving accessibility to

water supply and sanitation, roads and lanes, street lighting
and electricity for public facilities for about 350,000 residents
of existing informal settlements which are at present severely
deficient in such services.

The Bank will also contribute to employment generation
in the agro-industry sector of Pakistan where, under its Second
Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan Project, an
estimated 6,600 jobs are expected to be created.

Women in Development

During 1986, implementation of the Bank's policy on
women in development centered on promoting knowledge
and understanding of this issue within the Bank itself. This
was facilitated by a regional technical assistance on Women
in Development which provided about 28 months of consultant services to assist staff in the Country Department, four
Projects Departments and the Economics Office assess the
need and opportunities to revise present procedures and practices in order to give more explicit consideration to gender
issues.

With the assistance of consultants provided by this technical
assistance, a start was made to incorporate the consideration
of gender issues into the country programming activities for
each DMC. These efforts were facilitated by the preparation
of Women in Development briefing papers for Bangladesh,
Indonesia and Thailand, Others are being prepared for additional countries. Consideration is also being given to gender
issues during the formulation of the Bank's longer-term operational strategy in each DMC, and this is being facilitated by
the introduction of a section on gender issues in the operational strategy study for each DMC. During 1986, drafts for
such studies were prepared for Sri Lanka and Indonesia and
these studies were finalized in early 1987.

Preparatory work was completed on the development of
guidelines and procedures for giving explicit consideration to
gender issues during the preparation of projects in several
major sectors. Draft guidelines were prepared for ten sectors
and subsectors, including fisheries, forestry, livestock, irrigation and rural development, agro-industry, education, water
supply and sanitation, urban development and housing, health
and population, and development finance institutions.

Work also commenced on disaggregating by gender certain key indicators of development which are maintained by
the Bank for each DMC. Gender disaggregation of the selected
socioeconomic indicators will enable the Bank and its DMCs
to monitor changes in the welfare of both men and women
in each DMC as well as their participation in economic
development. During 1986, the Key Indicators of DMCs of
ADB which are prepared by the Bank’s Economics Office as
well as other data series maintained by the Bank were critically
examined to identify necessary modifications which may be
feasibly implemented.

Follow-up activities to implement the policy on Women in
Development will be expedited. Recognizing the importance
of this subject, the Bank has engaged a Women in Development Specialist who joined the Bank in early 1987.

Environmental Activities

Early in 1986. the Board of Directors endorsed a working
paper entitled “Review of the Bank's Environmental Policies
and Procedures’. The paper reaffirmed that the environmental
activities should continue to concentrate on: (i) reviewing the
Bank's projects to ensure that all potentially significant environmental impacts are identified. appropriate measures are

the Bank is assisting with three! loans totalling $11.4 million,
has greatly increased crop production and is ultimately expected to benefit an estimated 3,300 farm families

taken to avoid adverse impacts and, where possible. that projects enhance the environment: (ii) promoting environmental
awareness among Bank staff; (iii) acting as a regional development resource center; and (iv) supporting projects with direct
environmenial benefits — such as reforestation. water supply and sanitation, urban development and housing. and the
preparation of regional development plans — as well as
initiating and processing environmentally-oriented projects per
se. The paper noted that the most desirable way of promoting
sound environmental practices in the Bank's DMCs is by
strengthening the institutions dealing with the planning and
management of environmental and natural resources together
with the line agencies concerned with the monitoring and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations. Future Bank
support for these activities might take the form of technical
assistance to help establish or revise environmental legislation,
formulate environmental regulations and quality standards.
establish monitoring/ surveillance systems. and strengthen enforcement procedures. Technical assistance could also be used
to strengthen the planning and management of environmental and natural resourcesSevera! new activities were initiated in 1986 to strengthen
environmenta: and natural resources planning activities. These
‘included consolidating the environmental! review process during the project cycie, incorporating environmental considerations in the Bank’s couniry sector strategy studies, establishing
a liaison system with the environmental and related line agencies of the DMCs concerning the identity of environmentallysensitive projects and an appropriate work program, completion of seiected environmental guidelines, environmental institution strengthening, and a regional symposium on environmental and natura! resources ‘planning

Future activities will pay particular attention to: {i} the in

' {viii) resource center activities.

The Bank's environmental policy continues to provide a
flexible operational framework in which to blend the environmental dimension with the overall objectives of
cideconomic development programs projects. Further iniives are aimed at helping the DMCs plan and manage their
own environmental resources to ensure sustainable
development.

 

 

  
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
   
  

Inter-Agency Cooperation

The Bank's DMCs receive funds from a large number of
“bilateral and multiiateral donors apart from the Bank. In these
cxcumstances, if development assistance is to best serve DMC
needs there needs to be continued coordination of donor activities. Donors need to share resources, expertise and experiences, and to ensure that their activities are complemen‘tary. The Bank is therefore continuing and strengthening its
vefforts to cooperate with other agencies.
The Bank organized the Eighth ADB-Worid Bank Coor: dination Meeting in May 1986 at the time of the Bank’s 19th
Annual Meeting. In addition, the President attended the
meeting of Heads of Multilateral Financial Institutions and the
Development Committee Meeting in Washington. D.C. in

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), an
important source of grant assistance for the Bank’s lending
and technica! assistance operations. further increased its level
of assistance. The Bank was represented at UNDP’s Governing Council Meeting and Inter-Agency Consultative Meeting,
and contacts between Bank staff and UNDP resident offices
improved greatly. These contacts have facilitated cooperation
and resuited in a number of projects being co-financed with
the Bank. Bank officials heid an annual consultation with a
high-level deiegation from the Islamic Development Bank at
which information on policy and on the organizationai evoiution of the respective institutions was exchanged. Two projects were co-financed with the International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD) in 1986, an aquacuiture
project in Nepal and an agriculture development project in
ihe Philippines. The Bank also entered into co-financing
arrangemenis with the OPEC Fund in Nepal and Thailand.
A hydropower project in Western Samoa was financed jointly with IDA, the European Economic Community and the
European Investment Bank.

The Bank collaborated with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP} by holding the SemiAnnua! Meeting of Project Link and planning the Joint
ADB/ESCAP Workshop on International Comparison. In
addition, Bank staff attended several important meetings held
under the auspices of ESCAP. .

The Bank participates regularly in aid group meetings where
donor institutions meet with government representatives to
discuss economic and socia! developments in DMCs, external financing and aid coordination. In 1986, the Bank participated in aid group meetings for Bangladesh, Burma,
Indonesia, Nepa!. Pakistan, Philippines gnd a donors’ meeting
for Solomon Islands. For the first time, after attending for
several years as an observer, the Bank participated as a full
member at the India aid consortium’s 1986 Annua! Meeting.
The Bank participated in the Second Round Table Conference
for least developed countries in Asia and the Pacific for
Bhutan, Lao PDR. Maldives and Western Samoa.

Regular coordination meetings between donors are aiso

Introduction ~~

IN recent years the Bank has been increasing its efforts to
develop country strategies jor its programs of assistance to
‘DMCs. Recognizing that it should direct its lirnited resources
to sectors and activities which can best serve DMC needs, the
Bank is undertaking economic and social analysis to determine the major constraints to development in individual countries, and to evolve medium-term operational strategies for
‘ Bank assistance aimed at helping the DMCs to reduce or
eliminate these constraints. Major policy issues are examined
-and these are increasingly forming the basis of fruitful dialogue
between the Bank and DMC governments. Details of the
Bank’s operational strategies and programs of assistance for
“its DMCs are given in this chapter.

Bangladesh

Operational Strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy
for Bangladesh focuses on the development of selected sectors and subsectors which are accorded high priority within
the framework and objectives of the country’s development
plans as well as the Bank’s lending policies. The broad objectives of the strategy are: (i) increased agricultural production
and increased agro-industrial activity; (ii) development of
indigenous energy resources to reduce reliance on imported
commercial energy: (iii) selected improvement of social conditions, particularly in areas of population control, health and
education; and (iv) development/improvement of key
infrastructure facilities

In the agriculture sector, the emphasis is on increasing
foodgrain production, broadening the production base through
. Top diversification and strengthening linkages between

agriculture and agro-industry. Assistance is also sought for
hon-crop projects such as fisheries and livestock. In energy,
the Bank is concentrating on the development of gas welis,
gas transmission and distribution programs, as well as power
-Seneration, transmission and distribution. The Bank has also
‘encouraged adequate energy pricing and improved management of Public utilities for the better utilization of energy

 

__resources and improved mot

ization of domestic resources
In social development, the Bank's assistance is basically
through financing selected education projects as well as water
supply anc health projects. Bank assistance in these sociallyoriented sectors has been limited, being mainly complementary to the larger-scale programs of other donors. In development of infrastructure, the Bank seeks to support the programs
for rehabilitation of rural roads, inland waterways and railways.

The implementation of the Bank’s operational strategy is
facilitated by the Bangiadesh Resident Office (BRO) which
continues to play an important role in government liaison, aid
coordination, country prograrnming activities and project
review and implementation. In 1986, the Chief BRO attended
the Bangladesh Aid Consortiurn Meeting in Paris and chaired
a number of donor coordination meetings in Dhaka. Staff of
BRO also regularly attended local consultative group meetings.

 

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1986, the Bank
approved three loans amounting to $85.7 million for three
projects in Bangladesh from ADF compared to six loans
amounting to $212.3 million in 1985. Local currency financing of $40.6 million was provided for two projects. Cofinancing with UNDP amounted to $3.85 million for two projects while OECF co-financed $23.2 million for the supplementary loan for the Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Project. Of the three
loans approved, two were in the agriculture sector and one
in the industry sector.

In the agriculture sector, the Khulna Coastal Embankment
Rehabilitation Project will assist the Government to rehabilitate
the drainage and flood control systems in the project area,
thereby increasing foodgrain production, increasing rural
employment and improving family incomes for a large portion of the population in the project area. The Second
Aquaculture Development Project will assist the Government
to make optimum use of the natural resources of the country
and lead to: W expansion of shrimp and fish production and
thereby generate additional foreign exchange earnings for
Bangladesh; (ii) increase the availability of fish for domestic
consumption; and {iii).expand employment opportunities and
iead to increased incomes in the rural areas.

The supplementary loan for the Chittagong Urea Fertilizer
Project will enable the Government to complete the project

selected Bank-financed projecis in the agriculiure sector

for the production of about 561,000 metric tons of urea fertilizer annually by using indigenous natural gas as feedstock
and fuel, This will enable Bangladesh to achieve self-sufficiency
in urea fertilizer and to export surplus urea. Increased and
more stable supply of fertilizer is considered to be one of the
critical factors for Bangladesh to increase foodgrain production. The project will also promote industrial growth and create

Four project preparatory technical assistance grants amounting io $545,000 were also approved in 1986. As of
31 Decernber 1986, the Bank had approved 69 loans to
Bangladesh amounting to $1,924.3 million for 62 projects.
Of this amount, $11.4 million was from OCR and
$1,912.9 million from ADF. The Bank had also provided
technical assistance amounting to $38.7 million for 84 projects
of which 37 had resulted in Bank loans.

Project Implementation: Of the 69 joans (including
one Special Assistance loan} made to Bangladesh as of
31 December 1986, 25 had been completely disbursed and
44 were under administration of which three were awaiting
loan effectivity. Disbursernents amounted to $142.2 million
during 1986 compared with $145.5 million in 1985. Five loans
were closed during the year. Cumulative disbursements of
Bank loans at the end of December 1986 amounted to $666.6
million, or 35.9 per cent of the total amount of effective loans.

The Bank, at the request of the Government, has been
conducting Country Projects Review Meetings (CPRMs) with
senior officials of the Government on a semi-annual basis since
Decernber 1984. The CPRMs in 1986 covered various
problems which were hampering the timely implementation

of Bank-assisted projects in Bangladesh. These were mainly
related to delays in acquiring land, in procuring vehicles, in
implementing command area development schemes for
irrigation projects, in processing applications for letters of credit
and to procedural problems encountered in using the twoenvelope bidding procedure for power sector projects. As a
result of the discussions during the first CPRM in 1986, the
Government has exempted externally-aided projects from the
need for clearance by the Ministry of Industry in the implementation of its annual import policy.

Bhutan

Operational Strategy: In Bhutan’s present stage of
development and given the country’s economic potential, the
long-term objectives of Bank lending and technical assistance
operations are to help increase agricultural productivity, promote the development of physical and social infrastructure
and assist the process of economic diversification through
development of its natural resources and export base. The

agriculture which remains the primary vehicle for economic
development. Following a number of years of productivity
gains, mainly in paddy and rice, the focus will now be on structural adjustment with a view to agricultural diversification,
particularly to enhance export development. The Bank will
continue fo support other selected sectors such as industry,
energy, water supply, ports and shipyard development with
a stress on improving existing capacities through rehabilitation and promotion of operational efficiency. Socially-oriented
projects will be supported where urgently required facilities
either do not exist or are being operated beyond their useful
life. Institution building is also pursued, to ease institutional

China, People’s Republic of

Operational Strategy: The People’s Republic of China
became a member of the Bank in March 1986. Bank staff
visited the People’s Republic of China to discuss with government agencies possible priority areas where Bank assistance
could be applied. The country has embarked on its Seventh
Five-Year Plan (1986-1990), The Plan emphasizes the
importance of continuing the process of reforming the
country’s economic structure initiated since 1978 and choosing
an appropriate growth rate for the 1986-1990 period so as
to avoid overheating the economy and jeopardizing the
smooth implementation of reforms while at the same time striving steadily to improve the people’s living standards. The
Bank’s operational strategy in the People’s Republic of China
will consider the country’s own plans, priorities and development pace as well as the Bank’s general capacity in relation
to staff and financial resources. In addition, the strategy will
need to be evolved as knowledge and experience are gained

Indonesia

Operational Strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy
in Indonesia takes note of the country’s present need for laborintensive development while focusing on the crucial objectives
of supporting efficient economic adjustments for the transformation of the oil-dependent economy into one that is more
diversified and export oriented. This strategy broadly implies,
at the macro level, continuing support of key subsectors and
programs in agriculture, initiation of an increasingly direct role
for the Bank in the industrial sector, selective involvement in
physical and social infrastructure projects necessary for achieving efficiency improvements in the productive sectors and
diversification of energy-resource development. On a sectoral
basis, Bank strategy in agriculture is aimed at supporting the
Government's efforts to diversify the agricultural base and
optimize resource use. In the energy sector, the Bank’s strategy
supports the Government's plan to reduce the country’s
dependence on oil as a source of energy by non-oil and
renewable resources and improve energy demand management and conservation. Bank assistance to education and
institutional development in Indonesia is of special significance
in view of the severely limited availability of trained and skilled
manpower. On a selective basis, Bank assistance is extended
to support physical infrastructure, such as ports and roads,
and social infrastructure projects in urban development, water
supply, and health and population.

Loans and Technical Assistance: Bank lending to
indonesia totalled $319.1 million from OCR in 1986 compared to $500.7 million in 1985. A total of six loans were
approved in 1986. Local cost financing accounted for
$114.6 million including $30.6 million in the form of a Special
Project Implementation Assistance loan, or about 36 per cent
of Bank lending to the country during the year. Besides, loan
savings aggregating $85 million were allowed to be used to
meet local currency requirements of 26 ongoing projects. In
addition, accelerated loan disbursements amounting to
$5.3 million from the local currency financing provided under
the Bank loans for two projects were also allowed to be used
to meet their local currency shortfalis. One project involved

Agriculture accounted for avout 69 per cent of the Bank’s
lending to Indonesia during 1986. The three loans in the
agriculture sector helped finance irrigation, command area
development and oil palm projects, One port project in the
transport sector will improve the maritime transport system
in Kalimantan. In education, the Ministry of Public Works
(MPW) Manpower Education and Training Project will
improve the operational capabilities of MPW, while special
project implementation assistance helped finance the focal
currency requirements for the six ongoing Bank-assisted
projects in the education sector to ensure project completion.

In 1986, the. Bank also provided $2.5 million in technical
assistance for nine projects compared with $1.4 million for
six projects in 1985. Project preparatory technical assistance
totalled $650,000 for two projects and advisory, and operational technical assistance amounted to $1.9 million for seven
projects. Five of the projects were in the agriculture sector
(namely: livestock, forestry, irrigation and rural development,
and fisheries), and one each for transport, energy, social infrastructure and the construction of quarterly national
accounts.

As of the end of 1986, the Bank had approved 118 loans

this has adversely affected project implementation and loan
utilization. Current budgetary difficulties have drawn the
Government's attention to the need for timely implementation of ongoing projects. A high-level team was set up by
Presidential Decree in July 1986 to accelerate project
implementation and aid utilization. Conduct of the tri-annual
general country projects review of Bank-assisted projects has
now been assigned to this team.

During the year, the Bank responded to a request from the
Government for the stationing of Bank staff in Jakarta to assist
in project implementation and disbursements. Accordingly,
Bank staff were stationed there on an intermittent basis. Project
implementation and loan disbursements should continue to
be given priority by the Government and the Bank.

Korea, Republic of

Operational Strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy
for the Republic of Korea focuses on three major areas:
assistance for social and physical infrastructure; industrial
restructuring, including technology and manpower development; and assistance for energy saving and development of
alternative sources of energy. Bank assistance to social
infrastructure projects such as water supply and sewerage will
help promote a more equitable distribution of the benefits of
economic growth. Support for physical infrastructure will focus
on improvement of roads and ‘ports which will contribute to
balanced regional development. In the area of industrial
restructuring, technology development, including promotion
of research and development and manpower training, and
assistance to small and medium industries will receive priority.
In the energy sector, Bank assistance will emphasize energy
rationalization and development of domestic energy resources
to help reduce the country’s high depehdence on imported
energy.

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1986, the Bank
approved one loan amounting to $53 million from OCR to
the Republic of Korea compared with three loans totalling
$167 million in 1985.

The Marine Sciences Education Project, the second loan
for the education sector in the country, will assist in improving
the quality of education and training in the marine and fisheries
sector and further develop indigenous research capabilities in
oceanography. The Bank’s technical assistance program in
the Republic of Korea in 1986 consisted of three project
preparatory grants (Tenth Water Supply, Marine Sciences
Education and Highway Sector) for a total amount of
$233,850.

By the end of 1986, the Bank had approved 75 loans
totalling $2,169.5 million to the Republic of Korea. Of these,
74 loans ($2,165.8 million) were fromm OCR and one loan
($3.7 million) from ADF. The Bank made one equity investment amounting to $960,000 equivalent. The Bank has also
-provided 31 technical assistance grants totalling $4.3 million
comprising five for advisory and operational purposes
($1.4 million) and 26 for the preparation of projects
($2.9 million), 18 of which have resulted to date in 23

Of the Bank's total lending, two-thirds has been in sectors,
directly supporting the country’s industrialization efforts —
industry, development banks, energy and transport. in lending -,
through DFls, there has been a shift to a more balanced alloca:
tion of funds for the support of small and medium-scale
industries. In recent years, the Government has also increased.
investment in the social infrastructure sector. This change in
emphasis is reflected in the Bank’s lending since 1977, duting
which period one-third of its assistance has been for social
infrastructure. While this assistance has also had an industrysupportive aspect, a major objective has been to achieve an
improvement in the quality of life commensurate with the
country's rapid material development. There has also been
a rise in Bank lending to the energy sector in response to
increased energy consumption levels and the country’s dearth
of indigenous fuels.

during the year, the Government requested loan cancellations
totalling $185 million, mainly from. unutilized DFI credits
brought about by lower demand for foreign currency loans,
and from savings resulting from low bid prices received for
some contracts under project loans. The Government
requested full cancellation of the loan for the Ninth Water
Supply Project that was approved in December 1984 because
the resource position of the local government implementing
agency had improved to such an extent that the Bank’s loan

Lao PDR

 
 
 
  

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational strategy

in Lao PDR is aimed at: (i) improving the country’s basic

infrastructure in order to achieve better integration of the

economy, increased efficiency and stimulation of economic

activities; and (ii) increasing the country’s foreign exchange

' -earnings through development of its most promising exports.
To achieve these objectives, support is channeled toward
developing road transport, hydropower resources, power
transmission and distribution, and forestry and wood
‘processing.

 

 

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1986, the Bank
extended one loan of $12 million from ADF for the Second
Road improvement Project, aimed at rehabilitating and
upgrading about 135 km. of roads and_ strengthen
_ ing/replacing 28 bridges in the country’s southern provinces
of Champassak and Saravane. There was no loan to Lao PDR
in 1985.

The Bank also extended three advisory technical assistance .
grants to Lao PDR in 1986, for the preparation of a pilot road
maintenance study, a multi-sectoral master plan study (cofinanced by UNDP in the amount of $600,000) for the
development of the four southern provinces of Charnpassak,
Saravane, Xekong and Atopeu, and for management
reorganization of the Lao Wood Industries Corporation. In
addition, the Bank acted as Executing Agency for an advisory
technical assistance financed by UNDP for detailed engineering design and construction management for the Bankfinanced Second Road Improvement Project.

Technical assistance totalling $8.5 million have been provided
for 26 projects of which ten have resulted in Bank loans
amounting to $67.4 million. The sectoral distribution of
cumulative Bank lending reflects the Bank’s support for the
development of infrastructure, especially transport and communications and power distribution, and the promotion of
forestry and wood processing for export.

Project Implementation: Of the 13 loans approved to
Lao PDR, seven had been completely disbursed and six were
under administration at the end of 1986, including one that
was awaiting effectivity. Disbursements totalled $5.8 million
during 1986 compared with $4.3 millioh in 1985, Cumulative
disbursements of Bank loans at the end of 1986 amounted
to $34.5 million, or 61.5 per cent of the total amount of
effective loans.

Although ongoing Bank-financed projects in Lao PDR are
generally progressing satisfactorily, manpower and institutional
constraints have hamstrung the country’s capability to implement development projects. To alleviate this problem, the
Government, under a technical assistance grant from the
Bank, has established the Project Implementation Advisory
Services Unit (PIASU) in the State Planning Committee to
assist executing agencies in the implementation of Bankfinanced projects. With the help of a consultant provided under
the technical assistance, PIASU staff have been receiving onthe-job training in project implementation. The operation of
PIASU was strengthened in 1986.

Malaysia

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational strategy
for Malaysia supports the main objective of the New Economic
Policy — fostering structural change by redressing economic
and social imbalances. Within this context, the Bank is focusing attention on poverty alleviation, manpower development

- 54and selected physical infrastructure facilities. To address
poverty alleviation, the Bank has adopted a multifaceted
approach through projects in the agriculture, regional development and social infrastructure sectors. In agriculture, the Bank
is guided by the objectives of the National Agricultural Policy
which are to improve farm productivity and diversify farm
income; regional development has a focus on relatively poor
areas; and social infrastructure facilities such as health care
and water supply facilities provide for some of the basic needs
of the poor. In manpower development, the Bank recognizes
the special emphasis placed by the Government on the
expansion of technical and vocational education facilities.
Support for physical infrastructure mainly pertains to the
energy sector in view of its vital input in the development
process.

Loans and Technical Assistance: Bank lending to
Malaysia amounted to $105.2 million for two projects from

 

DRAINING swamps in Sarawak, Malaysia. This Agricultural
Drainage Project, assisted by a Bank loan of $25.4 million,
involves drainage and development of about 109,000 ha. of
land for farming and is expected to benefit some 38,000 farm
families:

all but one loan coming from OCR. In addition, technical
assistance totalling $7.4 million has been provided for 34
projects of which ten have resulted in Bank loans arnounting
to $336.1 million. The sectoral distribution of cumulative Bank
lending to Malaysia partly reflects the past emphasis on
physical infrastructure development and partly the more recent
thrust towards agriculture and social infrastructure
development.

Maldives

Operational Strategy: The Bank's assistance program
in Maldives has focused on transport, communications and
.Power infrastructure to support the directly productive investments Maldives has made with other assistance. This emphasis is expected to continue.

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1986, the Bank
Provided a technical assistance grant of $60,000 for the
breparation of a power system development project.
____ The Bank has so far provided two loans, both from ADF,

to Maldives for the development of inier-island transport
($1 million in 1981) and a multiproject loan ($2.4 million in
1984) for five subprojects supporting ports, communications
and power infrastructure. In addition, the Bank has provided
four technical assistance grants to prepare a feasibility study
for the inter-island transport project, to assist the Government
in identifying and planning priority investment projects, to
prepare subprojects under the multiproject loan and to review
inter-island transport operations.

Project Implementation: Disbursements totalled

_ $0.5 million during 1986 compared with $0.08 million in

19835, Cumulative disbursements of Bank loans at the end
of 1986 amounted to $1.3 million, or 35.2 per cent of total
amount of effective loans. .

The loan for the development of inter-island transport is
now under review for possible conversion of the inter-island

transport vessels to fish-collector vessels.

Nepal

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational strategy
in Nepal focuses on agriculture and is designed to enhance
agricultural productivity, increase food intake and diversify
agricultural products. This general objective is pursued through
broadly-based strengthening of the agriculture sector and crop
intensification aimed at significantly increasing productivity.
Particular emphasis is placed on construciing irrigation facilities,
developing rural infrastructure including electrification,
providing agricultural inputs and agricultural credit and
reversing ecological deterioration. At this stage of Nepal's
development, Bank lending to the non-agricultural sectors
basically supports the development of agriquiture in a way that
ensures satisfactory linkage with other seCtors while assisting
the long-term diversification of the economy.

THE recently-opened Hetauda cement factory in Nepal has
a capacity of about 260,000 meiric tons a year. This project
was aided by concessional Bank loans totalling $49.5 million

Loans and Technical Assistance: Bank lending to
Nepal amounted to $51.2 million for three loans from ADF
in 1986, compared with $58 million approved in 1985. The
loans approved in 1986 were in the agriculture and transport
sectors and included local cost financing of $10.5 million. The
projects were designed to complete the construction of the
new terminal of Tribhuvan International Airport; to alleviate
transport constraints by upgrading and improving existing
roads as well as reconstructing a bridge; and to increase rural
incomes and raise nutritional levels through fish production
in the Terai.

The Bank also approved nine technical assistance projects
amounting to $2.8 million in 1986. Of these, about $1 million
was provided by UNDP for two projects (Program Budgeting
and Project Monitoring Systems and Second Aquaculture
Development}. In addition to these co-financed technical
assistance projects, the Bank provided funds for the preparation of the Third Crop Intensification Program, the Third Hill

Project implementation in Nepal is generally behind
schedule mainly due to deficiencies in project preparation as
well as delays in project start-up, recruitment of consultants,
award of contracts and processing of variation orders during
construction. Scarcity of experienced technical staff, including
accouniants, delays in the release of budgeted local counterpart funds and complex administrative procedures are other
factors causing slippage in implementation schedules.

At the request of the Government, Country Projects Review
Meetings (CPRMs) have been conducted between the Bank
and senior officials of the Government on a semi-annual basis
since March 1985. These meetings focused on common
project implementation problems and constraints facing Bankassisted projects. As a result of these CPRMs, the Govern
ment adopted in 1986 a new policy on prequalification of local__

civil works contractors. Another policy on registration and.
classification of local contractors is also being formulated.

Pakistan

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational strategy
as recommended in the Pakistan Strategy Study — Strategies
for Economic Growth and Development — The Bank’s Role
in Pakistan (July 1985) — envisages that the main goais for

- Bank assistance in Pakistan should be balanced growth and

improved equity, to be achieved through activities designed
to promote appropriate structural change, improve economic
efficiency and strengthen development institutions. The Bank’s

“primary commitments in Pakistan should remain with

agriculture, energy and industry. The further development of
social and other infrastructure, however, should also merit
Bank attention as improvements in these sectors are a precondition for sustained long-term overall economic growth and

“structural change.

The major focus of Bank assistance in agriculture will be
toward increasing the productivity and output of the major

“crops, with diversification and minor crops to be supported

as a secondary and longer-term objective. The Bank’s involvement in the energy sector will focus on a program of gradual
diversification. While maintaining a continuing interest in the
Power sector with particular emphasis on acting as a catalyst
to mobilize co-financing for the sector and on improving operational efficiency, increased attention will be given to assisting
the Government in finding ways to moderate energy usage
and to increase the supply of indigenous energy resources.
In the industrial sector, traditional lending through the DFls
will be continued; however, the Bank will seek new areas and
develop diversified modalities such as equity investment,
leasing, direct lending to private industry and industrial parks
development. Bank assistance to the social sectors will be
increased from the past low levels, with an emphasis on education, primary health care and improvement of the envirenment in major urban centers.

agriculture sector will help finance agro-industries, importation of phosphatic and potassic fertilizers, cotton research, production and processing, and agricultural development through
groundwater and tickle irrigation facilities. An urban develop
ment project will help finance slum upgrading, solid waste
management and renovation of two sewage treatment plants
for Karachi. The Bank's tenth loan to the power sector will
help finance priority distribution, rehabilitation, generation and
transmission projects of the national power utility company
(WAPDA}.

The Bank approved 14 technical assistance projects for
Pakistan in 1986 totalling $3.7 million (including $960,000
financed by UNDP) compared with $2.7 million for eight
Projects in 1985, Project preparatory technical assistance

fwo each in the energy and social infrastructure sectors and
one in the industry and non-fuel minerals sector.

The Bank has so far provided 90 loans totalling
$3,228 million for 70 projects in Pakistan. Of these, 50 loans
amounting to $1,787.8 million (55 per cent) were from ADF
and 40 loans amounting to $1,440.2 million (45 per cent}
from OCR. Technical assistance totalling $14.5 million has
been provided for 61 projects of which 21 have resulted in
Bank loans amounting to $942.6 million. Bank lending has

Philippines

Operational Strategy: In response to the economic
crises which began in 1983 and continued into 1986, the
Bank's lending strategy recognized both the acute external and
domestic financial constraints faced by the Government, and
the need to address economic recovery and re-establish
economic growth. The strategy focused on assisting in the
completion of high-priority ongoing Bank-financed projects,

and the more equitable sharing of the benefits of develop.
ment. Government priority will be given to labor-intensive,
rural-based and small-scale activities to generate employment
opportunities and increase the real incomes of the people in
the rural areas. Accordingly, the Bank's operational strategy
has been further modified in 1986 to promote the country’s
long-term social stability by supporting some new projects that
will contribute to more direct employment, income creation,
poverty alleviation and satisfaction of basic needs, especially “=
in the rural areas. Nonetheless, while the severe domestic and
external resource constraints remain, Bank support will continue to be principally devoted to the completion of ongoing -2
Bank-assisted projects and the maintenance and improvement
of existing infrastructure facilities. :

 

Loans and Technical Assistance: Bank lending to the
Philippines in 1986 comprised two Special Project implementation Assistance (SPIA) loans totalling $100 million
{$50 million each from OCR and ADF resources) and four
project loans from OCK amounting to $216.8 million, totalling
overall $316.8 million, Mainly in response to the country’s
economic condition, particularly with respect to its severe
budgetary constraints and balance-of-payments situation,
Bank financing for the four project loans (including cofinancing in one case) covered 80 per cent of the total cost
of each project, instead of the 60 per cent ceiling normally
applicable to the country. With this increased percentage, the

The two SPIA loans provided foreign exchange to meet

-- about half of the Government's local currency expenditures
for 36 selected high-priority projects financed by the Bank in
key sectors such as agriculture, irrigation, energy, transport,
water supply and education. The Fourth Road Improvement
Project — the ninth Bank loan to the road subsector in the
country — would rehabilitate and improve national roads and
provide detailed engineering for rural roads in several areas
of the country. The Highland Agriculture Development Project
is the first Bank-assisted project to be devoted to the development ‘of highland farmers in Northern Luzon. The Island

Provinces Rural Water Supply Sector Project would provide... , . fee ee ee eee - ae

island provinces throughout the country. The Third Power
System Development Project — the twelfth Bank loan to the
National Power Corporation (NPC) of the Philippines —
would upgrade the overall standard and reliability of electrical
power service under the NPC power system.

‘In 1986, the Bank also provided $2.5 million in technical
assistance for eight projects. including supplementary
assistance to an ongoing project in the energy sector. Of the
seven new projects, six are advisory technical assistance. The
ingle project preparatory technical assistance provided
05 million for road feasibility studies and was financed by
JNDP ($550,000) and the Government of Switzerland
{$500.000), and administered by the Bank. The six advisory
echnical assistance projects totalled $1.4 million. Two were
in the energy sector and one each in the agriculture, road,
water supply and sanitation, and DFI sectors.

During 1986, the Bank, for the first time, made an equity
investment in Planters Development Bank, a small private
development bank.

At the end of 1986, the Bank had approved 82 loans totalling $2.427.8 million to the Philippines for 74 projects and
an agricultural inputs program loan. Of these loans, 73
amounting to $2,298.5 million were from OCK and nine,
amounting to $129.3 million, were from ADF. The Bank had
_ also provided technical assistance totalling $18.23 million for
78 projects of which 30 have resulted in Bank loans amount
“ing to $1,052.9 million. Bank lending activities have generally

followed its operational strategy for the Philippines which has
been modified since 1983 due to the current economic crisis
as mentioned above, and the country’s development plans

~*, ‘and priorities as indicated in the successive national develop
@f¢. Ment plans, the latest being the medium-term economic
. development plan (1987-1992). Cumulative Bank lending to
the Philippines as at the end of 1986 has emphasized the
agriculture sector which accounts for 29 per cent of total,
followed by energy (27.1 per cent), transport and communications (15.6 per cent}, water supply and sanitation (11.1 per

Project Implementation: Of the 82 loans approved for
the Philippines (including one Special Assistance loan and two
Special Project Implementation Assistance loans), 35 had been
completely disbursed and 47 were under administration,
including four that were awaiting effectivity. Disbursements
totalled $138.6: million during 1986 as compared to
$112 million in 1985. Three loans were closed during the year.
Cumulative disbursements of Bank loans at the end of 1986
totalled $1,242.8 million, or 61.9 per cent of the total amount
of effective loans.

The first $50 million tranche of the Special Project
Implementation Assistance (SPJA) loans approved in February
1986 was released to the Government on 30 June 1986. As
of the end of the year, $39.1 million of the first $50 million
had been utilized and it is anticipated that the second tranche
will be disbursed in early 1987. The Bank and the Government conducted an extensive dialogue to ensure that the funds
made available under the SPIA loans were channelled to
executing agencies promptiy as required. While some

procedural problems in utilizing the SPIA loans have beenexperienced, project implementation is starting to regain
momentum.

As a result of the close dialogue between the Bank and the
Government, several improvements have taken place,
including the establishment of imprest accounts. an increase
in disbursement percentages for Bank loans and clarification
of procedures for calculating escalation payments in civil works
contracts. The Bank’s Country Projects Review Mission in
February 1986 urged the Government to review and
streamline its procedures for approval of contract; these
suggestions were further discussed with the Ministry of Finance
im connection with the implementation of the SPIA loans
Procedures delegating greater authority to line ministries and
corporations approving contracts have also been adopted.

Singapore

Project Lnplementation: As of the end of 1986, all
14 loans approved to Singapore had been completely
disbursed bringing the amount of cumulative disbursements
to $144.4 million, or 100 per cent of the total amount of effective loans.

Sri Lanka

Operational Strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy
in Sri Lanka is designed to help reverse the trend towards
deterioration of capital assets, seek institutional and Policy
development in sectors where inadequacies constitute a
constraint to development, and give priority to certain structural adjustments needed in the economy. Important under.
lying themes of the Bank’s operational strategy are assistance
for private sector and export development. Through its lending
and technical assistance program, the Bank will also seek to
address financial and industrial policy constraints on private
sector industrial development. Concomitanily, the Government's development strategy is dependent on increasing
export earnings, and export promotion or efficient import
substitution constitute important components of a number of
the Bank’s pipeline projects.

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1986, the Bank
approved four loans totalling $102.3 million from ADF to Sri
Lanka compared with three loans totalling $54.4 million in
1985. Local cost financing amounted to $32.7 million, or

Thailand

Operational Strategy: The Bank’s lending strategy in
Thailand provides support for the Government's efforts under
the Sixth National Economic and Social Development Plan
and has the following broad objectives: {i} to assist in the efficient expansion of the productive sectors; (ti) to strengthen
the financial sector; (iii) to develop further infrastructure; and
{iv) to make public resource management more efficient. Thus,
given the critical economic role of the agriculture sector in
terms of exports, employment and poverty alleviation, Bank
operations will be largely oriented toward assisting government efforts in redirecting farming activities toward agricultural
diversification and the development of export opportunities.
In the industrial sector, Bank assistance will focus on lending
to the private sector without government guarantee. In addition, possibilities of direct equity investments will continue to
be explored. As a corollary to these, the Bank will examine
opportunities to assist the Government's industrialization program with particular emphasis on basic infrastructure such as
transport and communications. In the energy sector, Bank

   

BOTTLE-MAKING in a glass factory, one of several subprojects supported by a Bank loan of $50 million to the Industrial Finance

assistance will continue to provide support for the Govern.
ment's plans to strengthen the energy base required for the
country’s industrialization. In support of the Government's
regional development programs, Bank assistance will continue
to be provided for projects aimed at developing urban
infrastructure in the provinces as well as for those helping to
improve urban services in the metropolitan Bangkok area,
These projects will cover the backlog of unserviced areas and
address problems associated with congestion, flooding and
water and air pollution.

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1986, the Bank
provided three OCR loans totalling $50.5 million for three
projects compared with $168.9 million for two projects in
1985. A loan for the Brackishwater Shrimp Culture Development Project is expected to increase shrimp production,
leading to both improved foreign exchange earnings from
exports and increased domestic food supply. Co-financing of
$4 million from the OPEC Fund will finance part of the
institutional development and support services for the Project.
An energy development loan for the Mae Moh Extension
(Unit 9} Power Project will finance the second of the proposed
three 300 MW generating units which comprise the final stage
of the Mae Moh development scheme, providing a total
generating capacity of 1,725 MW upon completion. The Bank
provided its first loan to the private sector without government guarantee for $1.46 million, as well as an equity investment of $518,000 to the Northeast Agriculture Co., Ltd., to
establish a tomato paste factory with a processing capacity of
48,000 mt. of tomatoes for sale to domestic and export

63Smaller South Pacific Developing Member
Countries*

Operational Strategy: Recognizing the unique characteristics of the smaller South Pacific Developing Member
Countries (SPDMCs) as a group as well as individually, the
Bank has adopted a flexible approach in its strategy and
operating procedures to make them compatible with each
country’s particular needs and characteristics. In this context,
the Bank has emphasized providing necessary physical and
social infrastructure facilities, frequently in the form of multtproject loans covering several small projects in key sectors.
Support has also been channelled through credit lines to
national development banks. In addition, the Bank has
focused on institution building through human resource
development.

Since its establishment in 1984, the South Pacific Regional
Office (SPRO) has gradually assumed the authority delegated
fo it: this embraces a wide range of Bank operational activities.
The SPRO has since assumed responsibility in the formulation of the Bank’s operational strategy for Cook Islands,
Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu and the
preparation of country programs for these countries. SPRO
was also able to assume the administration of DFI loans for
most of the smaller SPDMCs and to administer several
ongoing projects in other sectors.

Tonga. The aggregate total of these four loans amounted to
$13.3 million from ADF. The loan to Kiribati, which will be
co-financed by the Government of Australia in an amount of
$0.16 million, will provide a new diesel power unit to provide an assured supply of power to satisfy existing and pro. |

At the end of 1986, the Bank had approved 43 loans
amounting io $101 million for 40 projecis in the smaller
SPDMCs. Technical assistance totalled about $11.5 million
for 76 projects of which 16 had resulted in Bank loans amounting to $36.9 million. The agriculture and agro-industry sector and lending through DFls accounted for more than onehalf of cumulative Bank lending to the smaller SPDMCs

Project Implementation: Of the 43 loans {including
one Special Assistance loan) approved to the smaller
SPDMCs, 25 had been completely disbursed and 18 were
under administration at the end of 1986, including three that
were awaiting effectivity. Disbursements totalled $3.5 million
in 1986 compared to $4.4 million in 1985. Cumulative
disbursements of Bank loans totalled $61.7 million, or
67.2 per cent of the total amount of effective loans.

Implementation of Bank-financed projects in the smaller
SPDMCs is generally satisfactory. Problems when they occur
are often related to geographical remoteness, the small size
of the countries, land acquisition problems and unavailability
of skilled manpower. The Bank continues to address these
problems by providing technical assistance to key institutions.

“FOLLOWING up on the changes in project administration that
were introduced in 1985, and which have resulted in more
efficient and more systematic supervision of projects, the Bank
in 1986 continued to make additional improvements designed
” to enable staff to monitor more closely the progress of projects
and to adopt more effective measures for dealing with
implementation problems. The project reporting system was
further streamlined with the adoption of standardized Project
Administration Committee (PAC) notes in order to meet the
‘Bank’s need for continuity and uniformity, More measurable
performance indicators are now being used which make it
easier to detect whether a project is lagging behind schedule,
is not achieving predetermined targets or is otherwise
considered unsatisfactory. To provide Bank staff with practical reference material on matters relating to the selection,
engagement and administration of consultants, a handbook
entitled A Guide to Bank Staff on the Engagement of Con‘sultants was prepared by the Central Projects Services Office.
A major thrust of the Bank’s project administration efforts

‘agencies assistance in strengthening their implementation
management capabilities and in identifying problems and
issues that have adversely affected the progress of project

execution. Thus, in 1986, several Bank publications were ~

made available to executing agencies such as the Handbook
on Management of Project Implementation, Handbook for
Users of Consultants, Handbook on Problems in Procurement
for Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank and
Sample Bidding Documents for Supply, Delivery and Installation of Goods. In addition, practical training for project staff
was also provided through regional seminars on project
implementation management conducted in Manila, PhilipPines. and Port Vila, Vanuatu {for the South Pacific countries), country seminars on procurement held in Bangladesh,
Burma, Indonesia and Philippines and country seminars on
uses of consultants that took place in Bangladesh, Indonesia
and Malaysia.

A total of 398 projects was under implementation as of the
end of 1986 compared with 408 as of the end of 1985. Based

during the year was providing to borrowers and- executing 
PROJECT ADMINISTRATION >
AND POST-EVALUATION

__ on the new criteria for assessing the progress of implementation of these projects, 337 were classified as satisfactory, 50
as unsatisfactory and 11 projects were inactive. The unsatisfactory projects were located in 13 borrowing mernber countries.

Continuing economic difficulties, which caused shortages
in local counterpart funds, adversely affected project
implementation in a number of countries. Other factors contributing to project delays included cumbersome government
procedures and requirements which delayed awarding of
contracts, lack of qualified technical staff, inability to comply
with loan covenants, poor performance of contractors, cost
overruns, poor project management and technical problems
“encountered during consiruction.

Many project-specific problems were dealt with by Bank staff
through project administration missions of which there were
354 in 1986, covering 492 projects. In addition, to deal with
county-wide problems and issues linked to government
policies and/or procedures laid down by ‘central government
authorities, the Bank initiated consultations with high level
government officials and, more specifically, undertook
Country Project Review Missions to Bangladesh, Indonesia,
Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines and Sri Lanka. These Country
Project Review Missions identified government policies, procedural bottlenecks and other major constraints which have
affected the progress of project implementation, and explored
and formulated possible remedial measures which were
discussed with, and in most cases adopted by, the government authorities concerned.

. Procurement is a major activity in project implementation
and the Bank continued its efforts to improve various aspects
of the procurement process. The Bank introduced a domestic
preference scheme designed to provide local! firms in DMCs
with a margin of preference when bidding for goods and services under Bank-financed projects and programs. To
encourage greater interest in international competition,
business opportunities seminars were held in Canada, India,
Republic of Korea and Netherlands, the latter being open to
all European member countries. Similar briefings were also
acranged for trade delegations and other business-oriented
groups that visited the Bank. The seminars on procurement
and on uses of consultants mentioned above were intended
to upgrade the knowledge and skills of staff of executing agen
67cies; in addition ad hoc advice was provided by the Bank’s
procurement specialists when requested in specific cases.
Likewise, disbursement missions were sent to 11 major
borrowing countries to assess the progress of contract awards
and to expedite the submission of withdrawal applications.

In line with the Bank’s mandate to assist in the development of the domestic consulting profession, symposia were
held in Pakistan and Bangladesh which were attended by 400
government officials and representatives of domestic consulting
firms. These enabled government officials and domestic
consultants to exchange views on how to promote the growth
of local consultants. A seminar was also held in the Republic
of Korea, at which senior officials of consulting firms learned
how to prepare technical proposals that comply with the
Bank’s requirements.

There were 43 consulting firms and 54 individual consultants engaged by borrowers for loan-financed projects while
74 consulting firms and 194 individual consultants were
employed by the Bank for technical assistance projects. The
net value of supply contracts awarded for all projects
amounted to $1,164.1 million in 1986 of which
$628.7 million was against ordinary loans and $535.4 million
against loans under the Asian Development Fund. This
brought curnulative procurement to $9,443.1 million, or
59 per cent of effective loans.

Loan Disbursements

The Bank’s loan disbursements are a yardstick of the inflow
of funds and the progress of projects in DMCs. In 1986, loan
disbursements reached a total of $1,024 million, an increase
of 1.4 per cent over 1985.

Disbursements under ADF joans increased by 5.6 per cent
to $412 million from the 1985 figure of $390 million. This
increase in ADF disbursements, which continued a rising trend,
was due partly to better implementation performance in areas
such as power, gas, fertilizer and development finance institutions and also to disbursements under the Special Implementation Assistance loan to the Philippines.

Ordinary capital resources loan disbursements dropped
slightly (by 1/3 per cent) to $612 million from $620 million
in 1985 due to the lower-than-expected price bids received
for civil works contracts and the delay in awarding of contracts
for some power projects against which substantial down
payments were expected to have been made in 1986. Another
contributory factor was the unusually large amount of OCR
joan cancellations ($530.8 million in 1986 compared to
$305.8 million in 1985) which consequently narrowed the
disbursement base.

Loan cancellations in 1986 totalled $649.9 million
compared with $400.5 million in 1985. These cancellations
represent loan amounts that will no longer be utilized due to:
{i) low demand for foreign currency loans in the case of DF]
credits; (ii) savings resulting from significantly lower bid prices
than originally estimated or from overestimation of allowances
for price escalation and physical contingencies; (ili) changes
made in project scope or components in several projects; and
tiv) decisions subsequenily taken by some borrowers not to

avail of Bank loans because of uh availability of funds from
other sources with more favorable terms and conditions. Apart
from the large cancellations in DFI loans, other substantial
cancellations were made in loans for water supply, agriculture,
power and transportation.

The Bank has completed a review of its disbursement
procedures and has issued a new Loan Disbursement
Handbook. Workshops and seminars have also been
conducted to promote betier understanding of disbursement
ptactices and procedures on the part of projects staff. Special
measures taken by the Bank such as provision of additional
local cost financing and conversion of loan savings into local
cost financing will continue to help improve disbursements.

Projects Completed

Thirty-five projects were completed in 1986, bringing the
total number of projects completed to 337 out of a total of
746 projects approved as of the end of the year. These completed projects were mostly approved in the late 1970s and
early 1980s with the earliest in 1973 and the most recent in
1984. While implementation delays are still being experienced
in the recruitment of consultants and procurement of goods
and services, a number of projects are being completed closeOMEN washing and selecting rice seeds (ieft) and transporting rice (right) in Central Java. To date, the Bank has provided

“over $1.5 billion in loans for agricultural projects throughout Indonesia.

‘to their original time and cost schedules. Examples of projects
completed in 1986 with good implementation performance
are the Batang Ai Hydropower Project in Malaysia, and the
Fifth Industrial Finance Corporation Project and the Natural
Gas Transmission Project in Thailand.

Twenty-nine Project Completion Reports (PCRs) were completed in 1986. As of the end of 1986, a total of 235 PCRs
had been circulated to the Board of Directors.

Project Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation

During 1986, the Bank's project benefit monitoring and
evaluation (PBME) program continued along lines which have
been previously established. These include the development
of procedures for preparing and using benchmark information about beneficiaries during the preparation and appraisal
of projects, and the introduction of project benefit monitoring
activities into completed projects so as to help executing
agencies ensure that the project facilities are effectively
operated and that maximum benefits are achieved.

Efforts which commenced in 1985 to encourage the

_Preparation and use of benchmark information during the

preparation and appraisal of a project (as compared with the
previous practice of getting information ready after the loan
became effective) bore fruit during 1986 when three irrigation and rural development loans — the Khulna Coastal
Embankment Project in Bangladesh, the Irrigated Command
Area Development Project in Indonesia and the Baluchistan
Groundwater and Trickle brigation Project in Pakistan — were
prepared with the assistance of benchmark information about
the people who will participate in and benefit from the project.
This benchmark information, which is normally prepared by
a local organization and is used by the feasibility study team
and Bank appraisal mission, has been found to be effective
in helping to prepare a project so that its components and
implementation arrangements respond to the needs and
wishes of the people who will be affected by the project and
who will participate in its implementation. The preparation
and use of: this information is now a routine feature of the
project preparation arrangements in irrigation and rural
development and consideration is being given to extending
the scope of coverage of these procedures to other sectors
of the Bank’s operations.

In May 1986, a work program was completed to develop
and test procedures for preparing and using “agro-institutional

69707

profiles” in small irrigation systems during the implementation
of a project. These profiles contain information needed to
design institutional development activities for beneficiary
groups and also contain data on the agricultural, demographic
and economic conditions in project areas. This work was
completed with the help of an advisory and operational
technical assistance to Indonesia’s Directorate General for
Water Resources Development (DGWRD) which was
approved in May 1983 and successfully implemented in the
Second Irrigation Sector loan to Indonesia, Similar profiles
will now be prepared for the other subprojects under this loan.
They will be used to: (i) design work programs for community
organizers to strengthen the water users’ organizations in each
subproject; (ii) ensure that modifications in canal layouts and
distribution structures coincide with farmers’ preferred patterns
of water distribution; (iii) help resolve questions concerning
the delegation of responsibility for water management between
the executing agency and water users’ groups; and (iv) provide
benchmark information for subsequent monitoring and evalua

domestic and international telecommunications facilities and
services.

 

tion. DGWRD will further modify and adapt these procedures
to other irrigation projects in Indonesia including the Third
Irrigation ‘Package Project, approved in 1986.

To help ensure that completed irrigation projects are effectively operated and provide maximum benefits, project benefit
monitoring activities were initiated by executing agencies in
several Bank-assisted projects which have been completed or
are close to completion in Indonesia, Nepal, Philippines and
Thailand. Project benefit monitoring reports, which are
prepared once each season, help the executing and other
concerned agencies to ensure effective systems operation and
are useful for identifying obstacles to increasing agricultural
production in these areas.

Post-Evaluation

During 1986, 35 Project Performance Audit Reports
{PPARs) covering the experience of 36 projects (including two
program loans) were circulated, raising the total number of
PPARs prepared to date to 200 (covering 212 projects).

All but five of the 36 projects were appraised during the
1970s. In total, they represent some $927 million in Bank
loans and $3.1 billion in overall investment. [n terms of
country and sector grouping, 42 per cent of projects were in
Group A countries and 36 per cent in the development banks
sector, the uneven spread reflecting the pattern of project completion. The largest sectoral grouping — 13 development bank
projects — resulted in the transfer of foreign exchange totalling
$292 million, through 11 DFis in eight DMCs, to finance
4,120 subloans involving an aggregate investment of
$1.2 billion equivalent.

In terms of overall results, the performance of this year's
group of projects shows little change from the results of projects
assessed during the last three yeats. A comprehensive assessment of results shows that 24 of the 36 projects (67 per cent}
were judged at audit to have been generally successful. The
remaining 12 projects — six in the development banks sector,
three in agriculture, two in energy and one in transport —
were found at post-evaluation to have fallen short of
expectations. In terms of capital, however, projects representing 73 per cent of the total investment of $3.1 billion appeared
to have generally achieved their objectives at post-evaluation.

The Bank's first program loan, approved in 1978, for the
Low-Lift Pump Maintenance Program in Bangladesh was
evaluated during 1985. The 1986 Review covered the third
and eighth program foans, both to Burma: the Cement
Industry Program (December 1979} and the Crop Intensification Program (November 1981). Experience from these
programs provides further evidence of the need for a more
systematic and pragmatic approach to policy dialogue. Program experience highlights the importance of policy reform
to achieve objectives. However, as policy issues are always
sensitive to the political system of each country, a single
program by itself may not be sufficient for a complete examination of all xelevant factors, and a longer term, more
comprehensive approach by the Bank may be required. In
terms of macroeconomic appraisal of program loans,
experience confirms the critical importance of adequatelyn

conclusion of the study is that both technical and socioinstitutional factors are crucial to project success and that both
aspects will have to be improved, particularly at the design

ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES

AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

THE pool-based variable lending rate system approved by the
» ‘Board of Directors in October 1985 came into operation on
1 July 1986. The new system applies to all loans approved
after 30 June 1986 and, at the option of the borrowers concerned, to loans approved in the period from 24 September
1985 to 30 June 1986. Under the new system, the lending
rate will be determined every six months, on 1 January and
1 July, by adding a spread (currently 0.50 per cent per
annum) to the average cost of a pool of Bank borrowings.
:All Bank borrowings settled after 30 June 1986 will be added
‘to the pool, and borrowings will be remioved from the pool

as and when they are redeemed. The variable lending rate
“for the six-month period ended 31 December 1986 was 7.65
per cent per annum.!

   
  

Financial Policies

The new lending rate system will have a major impact on

the Bank’s future financial structure. It will enable the Bank

vv to recover all changes in its financial and net adminisirative

: ~ expenses. It will also substantially reduce the major income

: risks inherent in the old fixed lending rate sysiem. Further
: more, it will give the Bank greater funding flexibility than was

available under the old system. In view of these features of

the new system, a review of the Bank’s principal financial

policies was considered timely and appropriate. According
iy, the Board of Directors in 1986 commenced such a review.

The review will continue through 1987 and include income

and liquidity policies, as well as policies on the commitment
charge and other loan charges.

Borrowings

The Bank's borrowings in 1986, consisting of eight public
bond issues and one private placement, totalled

$812.8 million. Details of the year’s borrowings are shown
in the table on page 157. oe ~ ~

In view of the relatively strong rise in the Bank’s liquidity
during the year, an effort was made to reduce the liquidity
impact of the 1986 borrowing program, and it was decided
that no separate program would be undertaken to refund certain outstanding borrowings that were prepaid during the year.
Prepayments during the year totalled $404 million. Consequently, the net impact on liquidity of the 1986 borrowing
and liability management programs amounted to
$408.8 million.

The Bank continued its efforts to maintain a presence in
the major capital markets. In the Japanese capital market it
made a private placement, in March, of 20-year bonds
amounting to ¥£20 billion and a public bond issue, in
December, amounting to *¥30 billion.

The Bank again made two public bond issues in the German
capital market. The first, in February, was for DM200 million
and the second, in September, was for DM100 million.

bonds. This issue of 30-year bonds, in January, was for a
redemption amount of SwF500 million with proceeds to the
Bank of SwF107.5 million. The other Swiss franc issue, in
dune, was for SwF100 million.

The Bank made two borrowings in US dollars. The first,
in April, was a public offering of 15-year bonds in the United
States for $100 million: and the second, in November, was
a $100 million public bond issue in the Euro-dollar capital
market. The proceeds of both US dollar issues were swapped
into a low coupon currency under related liability swap
transactions

In May, the Bank floated a public bond issue amounting
to {200 million in the Netherlands.

The average maturity of the year's borrowings, weighted
by amount, was 14.40 years compared with the average
maturity in 1985 of 12.72 years. At the end of 1986, the
average life of outstanding borrowings was 8.24 years. After
swaps, the average cost of the 1986 borrowings, weighted
by the amount of each borrowing, was 5.90 per cent per

annum.

Capitalization

      
    
   

The capital stock of the Bank is defined in its Articles-of
Agreement in terms of United States dollars of the weight ang
fineness in effect on 31 January 1966. Since the coming into
effect of the Second Amendment to the Articles of Agree.
ment of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on
1 April 1978, currencies no longer have par values in terms~
of gold. Pending the Bank's selection of the appropriate successor to the 1966 dollar, the value of the Bank’s capital stock
has been expressed, for purposes of the Bank's financial
statements, in terms of the SDR on the basis that each share
has the value of SDR10,000. The mutual obligations of each
member and the Bank with respect to maintenance of value
of currency holdings have also been measured by the same 1
standard, but settlement of such obligations has been held in :
abeyance. For purposes of the financial statements, the SDR

“has been translated into current United States dollars at the

rate computed by the IMF. As of 31 December 1986, the rate
was $1,22319 per SDR. Further information on the Bank's .
current practice regarding valuation of capital and maintenance .
of value is given in Notes A and E of the Notes to Financial
Statements of Ordinary Capital Resources, OCR-7.

In October, the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD} Board of Directors reached a decision
on the future valuation of IBRD capital and the resumption
of maintenance of value obligations. The decision will take
effect on 30 June 1987, i.e., as of the end of the IBRD’s current financial year. These questions have been studied in some
depth in the past in the context of the Bank. In the light of
the IBRD’s decision, however, a fresh examination of them
is now being undertaken by Bank staff. The results of such
examination are expected to be spbmitted to the Board of
Directors for consideration during 1987.

The third general capital increase (GCI Ill), approved by
Governors’ Resolution No. 158 in April 1983, consisted of
an additional 754,750 shares in the Bank’s authorized capital
stock. At the 31 December 1986 exchange rate of $1.22319
per SDR, the total amount authorized was $9,232 million
{SDR7,547.5 million). In the first half of 1986, two member
countries subscribed to GCI Il for a total amount of $61.1
million (SDR50 million), while the subscription of the United States, which was unable to pay the full amount of its third
instalment, was reduced by the equivalent of about $42 million
(SDR34.4 million). The United States, however, could. restore
its subscription by paying the shortfall in its third instalment
before the deadline for payment of the final instalment. By
31 May 1986, the extended final date for subscription,
GCI Ill subscriptions had been made by a total of 39 member
countries. Altogether, 739,437 shares had been subscribed,
representing about 98.4 per cent of the total share entitlements
of all member countries.

During the first quarter of 1986, new membership subscriptions were received from Spain and the People’s Republic of
China.

At the end of 1986, the Bank’s authorized capital stock
amounted to $19,663.3 million (SDR16,075.4 million). The
subscribed capital stock stood at $19,475.9 million
(SDR15,922.3 million) including subscriptions to GCI Ill totaljing $9,044.7 million (SDR7,394.4 million), the new membership subscriptions of Spain and the People's Republic of China

Future Resource Requirements

In May, the Board of Governors, recognizing the need for
a study of the Bank’s future resource requirements to finance

 

1 The Netherlands’ SCI became effective in January 1987

its ordinary operations, adopted Resolution No. 179 requesting the Board of Directors to undertake such a study and
to report its findings and recommendations to the Board of
Governors for consideration and action. As background to
the study, which will eventually lead to the formulation of
specific proposals for a further general capital increase
(GCI IV), a number of working papers will be considered by
the Board of Directors in the course of 1987.

Investments

At the end of 1986, the Bank’s OCR investments were

_ denominated in 22 currencies and amounted to the equivalent

of $4,170 million ($3,471 million at the end of 1985). Of the
total investments, 83 per cent (76 per cent at the end of 1985)
was held in securities issued or guaranteed by member governments, obligations of other multilateral development banks
and of approved government agencies of member countries.
The remainder was invested in deposits and other bank
instruments in member countries. The realized rate of retum
on the Bank's OCR investments over the year was 9.52 per
cent compared with 11.03 per cent in 1985.

Disbursements from ordinary capital resources during 1986
amounted to $612 million, bringing’ the cumulative
disbursements from this source to $6,092 million up to the
end of 1986. Repayments during the year from loans held
by the Bank amounted to $248 million, As of end December |
1986, cumulative joan repayments reached $1,478 million.
This consisted of $1,461 million on loans held by the Bank
and $17 million on portions sold to participants.

Fourth ADF Replenishment (ADF V)

NEGOTIATIONS on the fourth Asian Development Fund
replenishment {ADF V), which is intended to finance the
Bank’s concessional lending program in the four years
1987-90, were concluded in April. The replenishment agreed
“upon was $3.6 billion (at the average of daily exchange rates
during the first quarter of 1986). Of this amount, $72 million
will be set aside and allocated to the Technical Assistance
- Special Fund (TASF) for technical assistance to poorer DMCs
and for regional technical assistance. Contributions to the
replenishment would be provided by the developed member
countries and by Indonesia and the Republic of Korea.
Resolution No. 182, incorporating the agreed replenish-ment arrangements, was adopted by the Board of Governors
on 1 October 1986. Pursuant to the Resolution, the ADF V
arrangements will become effective when the Bank has received unqualified contribution commitments from the
“developed member countries totalling at least $1.8 billion. The
target date specified for this purpose is 31 May 1987. It is envisaged that contributions would become available for operational commitments in four equal annuai tranches over the
period 1987-90, such availability depending on the actual
Progress in receiving contributions and in securing the
necessary appropriations in respect of the annual instalments
of qualified contributions. As of 31 December 1986, an
Instrument of Contribution to ADF V had been received from
France.

Third ADF Replenishment (ADF IV)

The third ADF replenishment (ADF ['V) was authorized by
Governors’ Resolution No. 154, adopted in July 1982, to
finance the Bank’s concessional lending over the four-year
Period 1983-86. At the exchange rates specified in the Resolu
tion, the total amount authorized was $3,214 million.

SPECIAL FUNDS:
ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND AND ©
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SPECIAL FUND

As permitted by the Resolution, the contribution com
“mitments of Canada and the United States to ADF IV both

contain a qualification that payment of their contribution instalments is subject to budgetary appropriations. Under the
ADF IV “trigger” arrangements, the release of the second,
third and fourth tranches of the unqualified contributions for
loan commitments is subject to the availability of the first,
second and remaining two tranches, respectively, of the
qualified contributions. The fourth tranche will be released in
proportion to the extent that each qualified contribution has
become available for loan commitments beyond three-fourths
of its total amount. By the end of 1985, Canada had made
available the first three tranches of its contribution in full, while
the United States had made available only its first two tranches.
In February, the United States released $95.7 million of its
third tranche, the full amount of which is $130 million. Also
in February, Spain, shortly after becoming a member of the
Bank, deposited a contribution commitment to ADF for the
equivalent of about $31 million {at the end-Febmary exchange
rates adopted by the Bank). In addition, France’s additional
contribution to ADF IV amounting to the equivalent of
$15 million (at the Resolution No. 154 exchange rates) was
received in dune. The first three tranches of both Spain’s contribution and France’s additional contribution became available
immediately for loan commitments.

In August, the fourth tranche of Canada’s contribution was
released in full. The balance of $34.3 million of the United
States’ third tranche, together with $57.1 million, or
43.93 per cent, of its fourth tranche became available in
November, thereby releasing the fourth tranches of the
unqualified contributions to the extent of 43.93 per cent.
Australia, Belgium and Norway, however, voluntarily released
their fourth tranches during the year in full.

Availability and Utilization of ADF
Resources i

At the beginning of 1986, the net ADF resources available
for concessional loan commitments. after allowing a provision
for exchange rate. fluctuations, were about $331 million. In
. 1986, largely reflecting the significant appreciation of most

contribution currencies against the US dollar, the Bank had
adequate resources for completing the year’s concessional
lending program. Apart from exchange rate gains, additions
to resources during the year {at the 31 December 1986
exchange rates) consisted of a total of $187.1 million from
the United States under its ADF IV contribution, $62 million
for Canada’s ADF IV fourth tranche, a total of $35 million
for the first three tranches of Spain’s initial ADF contribution.
and France’s additional contribution to ADF IV, $299 million
for the 43,93 per cent portion of the unqualified ADF IV fourth
tranches released in November, and a total of $48 million for
the fourth tranches of the unqualified contributions of
Australia, Belgium and Norway released in full on a voluntary
basis. A further $36 million accrued to ADF by way of net
income. After allowing for changes in value in terms of the
United States dollar, total ADF resources increased during
1986 by $1,683 million to $7,764 million, as shown in the
table on page 158. ADF loan approvals during the year
totalled SDR532 million, or the equivalent of $633 million
at the exchange rates applicable at the time of loan negotiation.

resources were denominated in 18 currencies and amounted +
to the equivalent of $618 million ($441 million at the end of
1985). Of the total investments, 28 per cent (37 per cent at
the end of 1985) was held in securities issued or guaranteed |
by member governments and obligations of approved government agencies of member countries. The balance was invested
in deposits and other bank instruments in member countries,
The realized rate of return on ADF investments over the year
was 8.66 per cent compared with 9.75 per cent in 1985,

‘Staff

The Bank's staff at the end of 1986 totalled 1,580 from
37 member counties: 595 professional staff and 985 supporting staff. During the year, there were 63 professional staff

generally provide the same type of housing assistance to their
employees. The package provides financial assistance principally for (i) the purchase or construction of a house and/or
lot; {ii) major repair and/or renovation of an existing house;
and (iii) refinancing of existing housing loans. The facility is
open to all supporting staff members who have completed
a continuous seven-years service with the Bank and have fully
satisfactory ratings or equivalents for the three years prior to
availment of a loan. An important feature of the scheme is
that it will not add any costs to the Bank. Staff will pay interest-at the OCR rate plus an additional 2.5 per cent to meet
administrative costs, exchange risks and other contingencies.
The lending rate will be reviewed annually.

Organization i

In March, a Private Sector Division was established in the
Industry and Development Banks Department to provide a
focal point for all Bank private sector activities in the DMCs.

A review was undertaken in May of the South Pacific
Regional Office (SPRO) to assess its performance and the experience gained in its nearly two years of operation. As a
result, recommendations to improve work coordination,
delineation of functions between SPRO and concerned. Headquarters units, and staffing were implemented.

The Personnel Division of the Budget, Personnel and
Management Systems Department was reorganized in June
and two divisions, namely, Compensation and Training Division and the Human Resources Division were established.

The functions in the Treasurer’s Department were reorganized in July. Tne former Treasury Operations Division (which
combined the Bank's investment and borrowing functions) was
bifurcated into the Investments Division and the Funding Division, thus separating the two functions for more effective
management. The Treasury Services Division, less the investmeni support functions which were transferred to the new Investments Division, will continue with responsibility primaxily
for cashier's functions.

The Office of Administrative Services was reorganized in

delivery of health care and family planning services.

October in order to distribute its work more evenly and to improve its support services. This resulted in the conversion of
the Building Services Division to a section and the creation
of a new Support Services Division.

Following Board consideration in August of a working paper
on the Bank’s resident offices in DMCs, proposals regarding
criteria to be used in establishing such offices in DMCs and
on the establishment of a resident office in Indonesia were
approved by the Board. A working paper on the establishment of a resident office in a second time zone was also considered in October. it was decided to revert to this matter at
a future date.

A reorganization of the Country Department, Agriculture
Department and Irrigation and Rural Development Department was endorsed by the Board in November for
implementation in the early part of 1987. This is intended to
strengthen the country orientation and focus in Bank operations and the quality of its services to the DMCs. The
reorganization is based on a geographical decentralization of
functions and provides a more effective country-focused span
of control and management process.

   

Internal Audit

Internal auditing provides Management with independent
and objective evaluation of the adequacy and effectivencis
of controls, systems and procedures in the financial, account.
ing, administrative, data processing and other functions of the
Bank. The internal Audit Office (/AO} reports to the Presi,
dent and the Audit Committee of the Board (ACB). ,

During 1986, [AO reviewed systems and procedures
relating to financial, accounting, general administrative matters and project loan administration. A financial audit of the
Bangladesh Resident Office was conducted during the year,
1AO participated in the development of a number of computer systems and subsystems developed by the Office of
Computer Services and took part in the signing off of these
systems. In working with the Bank’s external auditors, IAQ ©
provided integrated assistance to cover in rotation portions

of their overall audit coverage and developed computer soft- 4

ware for generating schedules, statements and samples of
transactions to be used by the external auditors. The external
auditors expressed their satisfaction with IAO’s responsiveness
and attention to their needs. [AO also played an active role
in preparing for the audit of consultants’ contracts and subsequently reviewed the audit reports submitted to the Bank, JAO
participated in reviewing procedures on certain administrative,
financial and project-related matiers and participated in various
Bank committees.

The results of audits and recommendations were conveyed
to Management and Heads of Departments and Offices concerned for information and appropriate action. The sixmonthly Audit Recommendations Implementation Report
serves as a means of informing Management, the ACB and
Bank staff of the continued effgtts of concerned Departments/Offices to enhance internal controls, economy and éfficiency in the Bank’s operations in general. During 1986, most
of the internal audit recommendations made had been implemented and the remainder are in the process of being im=
plemented. In this connection, the Audit Committee expressed
its satisfaction with the progress made in the implementation:
of audit recommendations.

Computer.and Office Automation Systems ‘

The Board of Directors, in March and dune 1986, approved capital expenditure programs to advance the Bank's computer
and office automation systems during the period 1986-88.
During the year, additional microcomputers were also
ifistalled, increasing the total number to 330 including 70
portable microcomputers for use during missions. These
microcomputers are used as standard tools by staff for sectorspecific data files, econometric studies and financial and
economic analysis of projects; some are also linked to the
central data base to transfer Joan administration and
accounting data from the data base to microcomputers. The
data base was reorganized and related software and hardware
upgraded to run on a network of two mainframe computers.
Fo cope with increasingly large files and transaction volumes, -AN AGRICULTURAL class in Lahan, Nepal. Training is part
of an Integrated Rural Development Project to increase production in agriculture, cottage and rural industries and in the
forestry, horticulture and livestock subsectors. Supported by
a Bank loan of $14 million, this project is expected to benefit
about 180,000 families.

 

network upgrades were programmed. Programs were
modified or added to support applications related to variable
lending rate procedures, financial projections, financial statement schedules, co-financed and special assistance loans,
technical assistance operations, document indexing, staff
benefits administration, semi-monthly payroll, library
acquisitions, property control, procurement and budget
control. The internal electronic maii system was expanded to
include additional users in selected departments and offices.

Office Accommodation

leased in a satellite building to accommodate the Special
Projects Office. This will help ease congestion in the Headquarters building and consolidate those departments and offices which have become fragmented.

New Headquarters Building

In April, President Corazon C. Aquino of the Philippines
laid the foundation stone of the new Headquarters building
in Ortigas Commercia! Center. During the year, the main
construction phase commenced, and by the end of the year
all subcontracts for specialist services, except those for furniture
and furnishing, had been awarded. A specialist consuliant was
recruited and commenced work in April 1986 for the design
and procurement of furniture and furnishing for the new
building. The new building is expected to be cornpleted and
occupied during 1988.

Budget

Internal Administrative Expenses for 1986 amounted to
$84.5 million against the original Budget of $89.3 million,
representing 95 per cent utilization of the latter. The difference
of $4.8 million against the Budget is due mainly to savings
under Board of Directors, staff salaries and benefits, consultant services, business travel and representation, other administrative expenses and non-use of the general contingency.

The Administrative Budget for 1987, which is summarized
in Appendix 1, provided for Internal Administrative Expenses
amounting to $94.2 million. The Board approved the Budget
in December 1986 noting that due to the lower-than-assumed
general salary increase for professional staff in 1986 the Budget
stood reduced by $805,000 to $93.4 million. This represents
an increase of $8.9 million over actual expenses in 1986. The
increase is largely attributable to: (i) effect of the new staff positions in the past year and additional staff required for 1987;
(i) effect of salary and benefits improvements approved in
1986 and further improvements subject to consideration in
1987; (iii) increase in consultant services due to price and
volume factors; (iv) additional business travel required for the
Bank’s work in 1987; (v) additional overheads, mainly for
communications, office occupancy, expendable supplies, contractual services and insurance coverage in support of the
Bank's functions; (vi) past and prospective price escalation;
(vil) provision for the new Indonesia Resident Office; and
(viii) provision for General Contingency.

Commitments for Services to Member Countries in 1986
amounted to $24 million, representing full utilization of the
original Budget and an increase of 23 per cent over actual
commitments of $19.5 million in 1985. Provision is made in
1987 for new commitments amounting to $26 million,
representing an increase of 8 per cent over the actual commitments in 1986.

OTE A — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

unctional Currencies and Reporting Currency

he currencies of members are functional currencies. The
porting currency is the United States dollar, and the
nancial statements are expressed in thousands of current
ited States dollars.

aluation of Capital Stock

he capital stock is defined in Article 4, paragraph 1 of the
ticles of Agreement Establishing the Bank (the Charter)
in ‘terms of United States dollars of the weight and
neness in effect on 34 January 1966” (the 1966 doliar) and
e value of each share is defined as 10,000 1966 dollars.
‘he capital stock had historically been translated into the
rent United States dollar (the Bank’s unit. of account) on
basis of its par vaiue in terms of gold. From 1973 until
March 1978, the rate arrived at on this basis was

 

Second Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the
rnationai Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect, curren:
s.no longer have par values in terms of gold. Pending the
ank's selection of the appropriate successor to the 1866
lar, the capital stock has been valued for purposes of

ight (SDR) at the value in current United States dollars as

000.

6 Current United States dollar was $1.22319 ($1.09842 —
1986) giving a value for each share of the Bank’s capital
quivalent to $12,231.90 ($10,984.20 — 1985). However, the
ank: could decide to fix the value of each share at
$42,083.50 based on the 31 March 1978 par value of the
United States doltar in terms of gold. If the capital stock as
of 31 December 1986 had been valued in terms of $12,083.50
‘per-share, the net maintenance of value obligations would
ave been $94,454,000 ($205,333,000 — 1988) receivable

the period. Translation adjustments other than those
telating to maintenance of vaiue of currency holdings (see
Notes E and |}, are charged or credited to “Accumulated
translation adjustments”. Exchange gains or losses on currency transactions among functional-currencies are included in income, Currency swaps made in connection with borrowings are hedged by forward exchange commitments,
and accordingly do not result.in any net exchange gain or
loss.

Loans

The Bank’s loans have been made to or guaranteed by
members or their governments, with exception of loans to
the private sector, and have maturities ranging between 10
and 30 years. The Bank requires its borrowers to absorb exchange risks attributable to fluctuations in the value of the
currencies which It has disbursed. The Bank has not suffered any toan losses to date and follows a policy of not

taking part in debt rescheduling agreements.

NOTE A — GENERAL
_The Asian Development Fund {the Fund) was estabiished

Ec Bank.

  
   
  
   
  
  
  
   
   

The resources of the Fund have ‘been subsequently
augmented by three replenisnments, the most recent of

 

US$3,214,073,000 to cover the operational requirements for
the four years ending 31 December 1986. °

‘On 1 October 1986, the Board of Governors authorized the

 

equivalent to approximately $3,600,000,000 for the four

“ment program. The replenishment shall come Into effect on
‘or before 31 May 1987 when Instruments of Contribution
shal! have been received by the Bank of unquaiified conribution commitments in.an aggregate amount equivalent
ito at least.$1,800,000,000. Approximately 2% of each contribution {an aggregate amount equivalent to $72,000,000)
is to be allocated to the Technical Assistance Special
Fund.

“NOTE B — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

‘Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of contributing members are functlonal-currencies. The reporting currency is the United States dollar,
and the financial statements are expressed In thousands of
current United States dollars.

Translation of Currencies
Assets, ilabilities and contributions committed are

s\ translated from their functional currencies to the reporting
~ currency generally at the applicable rates of exchange at

 

on .28 Juns 1974 to streamline.special operations-of-the....

: which was in July 1982 in a totai amount equivalent to
ourth replenishment of the Fund in -a total amount 
years ending 31 December 1990 under a four-year, instal- ?

the end of a reporting period. Incoms and expense amounts
are translated for each semi-monthly period generally at
the applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each

period; such. -practice approximates the apptication of -~

average rates in effect during the period. Translation adjustments relating to contributions are oftset by increases
or decreases In the contribution accounts. Translation adjustments relating to set-aside resources {see Note’ £) are
recorded as receivable from or payable to Ordinary Capital
Resources. Other transfation adjustments are charged or
credited to “Accumulated transiation adjustments”. Exchange gains or losses on currency transactions among
functional currencies are included in income.

Loans

Concessional loans of the Fund have been extended to.cer-”

tain developing meriber countries, bear only. a. service
charge and generally require repayment over a 4G-year
period. The Fund requires Borrowers to absorb ‘exchange
tisks attributable to fluctuations in the value of the.currencies disbursed. The Fund has not suffered any loan losses
to date and foliows a policy of not taking part In debt
rescheduling agreements.

Contributions

Contributions by member countries are included. in ‘the
financial statements as amounts committed from the date
instruments of Contribution are deposited and related formalities are completed.

_ NOTE C — INVESTMENTS

As of 31 Dacember 1986, the market value of investments
was $620,199,000 ($442,822,000.— 1985), including investments not traded In the market (time deposits, etc.)
which were vaiued at their cost or amortized cost of
$508,664,000 ($350,667,000 — 1985). During the year ended
31 December 1986, sales of investments resulted in a net

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1986 and 31 December 1985

 

galn of $890,000 ($1,534,000 — 1985). Gains and losses on
sales of investments are measured by the difference between average amortized cost and the net proceeds of
sales, The annualized rate of return on the average In
vestments held during the year, based on the portfolio held _

at the beginning and end of each quarter, including realized
gains and losses, was 8.66% (8.75% — 1985).

NOTE D — ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. AND
ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

Administrative expenses include an administration charge
from Ordinary Capital Resources amounting to $40,621,000
($36,141,000 — 1985). The charge represents an apportionment of ail administrative expenses of the Bank {other than
those appertaining directly to ordinary operations and
special operations) based on the number of loans approved
for the year. ’

NOTE E — SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1(l} of
the Articles of Agreement Establishing the Bank, the Board
of Governors has authorized the setting aside of
10% of the unimpaired “paid-in” capital paid by members
pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(a) and of the convertible
currency portlon pald by members pursuant to Article 6,

 

  

paragraph 2(b) as of 28 April 1973, to be used as a part of .
the Special Funds of the Bank. The capital so set aside was allocated and transferred from the Ordinary Capital

Resources to the Fund as Set-Aside Resources, .

The capital stock of the Bank Is defined In Article 4, para.
graph t “In terms of United States dollars of the weight and
fineness In effect on 31 January 1966" {the 1966, dotiar).
Therefore, Set-Aside Resources had historically. been
translated Into the current United States doilar (the Bank's
unlt of account), on the basls of its par value in terms of - ;
gold. From 1973 until 31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on
this basis was $1.20635 per 1966 doilar. Since 1 Aprli 1978,
at which time the Second Amendment to the Artictes of
Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came
Into effect, currencies no longer have par values In terms of
gold. Pending the Bank’s selection of the appropriate suc: |
cessor to the 1966 dollar, the Set-Aside Resources has
been valued for purposes of the accompanying financial
statements in terms of the Special Drawing Right (SDR), at ..
the value In current United States dollars as computed by
the IMF. As of 31 December 1986, the value of the SDR tn
terms Of the current United States dollar was $1.22319
{$1.09842 — 1985). On thls basis, Set-Aside Resources

amounted to $58,236,000 ($52,295,000 ~~ 1985). if the
capital stock of the Bank as of 31 December 1986 had been
valued in terms of $12,063.50 per share, Set-Aside
Resources would have been $57,434,000.DELOITTE HASKINS & SELLS

Headquarters in Manila, Philippines. It is owned by the
governments of 40 countries from the

formally adopted the objectives of economic growth, poverty
reduction, improving the status of women, supporting human
development (including population planning), and environmental protection. These objectives are supported by specific
thematic priorities, such as encouragement of the private
sector, strengthening of public sector management capacity,
human development, and natural resource management.
Most Bank financing is designed to

 

region and 16 countries from outside
the region.

During the past 30 years, the Bank
has maintained its role as a catalyst in
promoting the development of the
most populous and fastest-growing region in the world today. The Bank's
principal functions are (i) to make
loans and equity investments for the
economic and social advancement of
DMCs; (ii) to provide technical assistance for the preparation and execution of development projects and
programs and advisory services; (iii) to
promote investment of public and private capital for developmenr purposes;
and (iv) to respond ro requests for assistance in coordinating development [™

priority to regional, subregional, and national projects and
programs, which will contribute to the harmonious economic
growth of the region as a whole and promote regional
cooperation.

The financial resources of the Bank consist of ordinary
capital resources (OCR}, comprising subscribed capital, reserves, and funds raised through borrowings; and special
funds, comprising contributions made by member countries,
accumulated net income, and amounts previously set aside
from the paid-in capital. Loans from OCR on nonconcessional terms account for 70% of cumulative Bank lending.
Such loans are generally made to member countries which
have attained a somewhat higher lével of economic development. Loans from the Asian Development Fund are made on
highly concessional terms and almost exclusively to the poorest borrowing countries.

The Bank has borrowed funds for its ordinary operations from
the capital markets of Asia, Europe, Middle East, and North
America as well as international capital markets, and from
certain member countries’ central banks. The Bank’s callable
capital, which ac the end of 1996 accounted for about 93% of its
subscribed capital, backs its borrowings in rhe capital markets.

319The Bank supports viable economic activities, such us
the Anging Acrylic Fiber plant in the People's Republic
of China. The Bank approved a loan of $105 million i
1991 for this financial sector project.Overview

HE BANK continued its country-based, integrated approach to

. development in 1996, emphasizing, in particular, policy review, capacity

building, regional cooperation, and project activities. The emphasis on

policy support and reform reflects and reinforces the evolution of the Bank
from project financier to development catalyst and agent of change.

Several events of particular importance occutred this past year. First,
the Bank introduced important changes to its program lending policies. A
new sector development program modality was introduced; sector analysis
becaine a precondition for program lending, which continues to be important; and social and environmental issues as well as mitigating measures
were emphasized.

Second, the Bank revised its Human Resoutce Strategy, thereby aligning mobilization of human resources with its strategic objectives. These
include the need to strengthen staff competencies, to enhance work unit
and staff productivity, and to promote staff morale and professional growth.

Third, the Bank approved the establishment of the Asian Development
Bank Institute (ADBI) in Tokyo. The ADBI, which will be a major focal
point for research on development strategies and for training in development management for policymakers and senior managers from the Bank’s
developing member countries (DMCs), has two major objectives: (i) to
identify development strategies suited to the particular social and economic
circumstances of DMCs, and (ii) to improve the capacity for sound management of the agencies and organizations in DMCs engaged in development work.

Fourth, the Bank opened two representative offices (Europe and
Japan) to enhance public awareness about the Bank and its activities
and assist in its resource mobilization efforts, and commenced operations
in two resident missions (Cambodia and Viet Nam) to assist in project
implementation.

Fifth, the Bank supported, through broad adjustment programs, wideranging structural teforms in several Pacific DMCs.

Sixth, the Bank approved the first loan to Uzbekistan in December
1996. The Rural Enterprise Development Project will support market-based
development of small and medium nonstate enterprises in rural areas.

Additional events of significance in 1996 include the following.
Negotiations on the sixth replenishment of the Asian Development Fund
(ADF VII) continued throughout 1996 with donor meetings in Bonn, Manila,
Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, and Copenhagen. Substantial progress was
achieved toward an agreement that would meet the Bank’s requirement for
concessional resources for the four-year period 1997-2000.

Fifty-five members had subscribed to the Fourth General Capital Increase
(GCI IV) by the final deadline of 30 September 1996.

Finally, the 29th Annual Meeting of the Bank’s Board of Governors
was held in Manila, Philippines, from 30 April to 2 May 1996.

966, the Asian and Pacific region was one of the poorest regions in the
world. Nations, many of them former colonies, struggled to develop their eco
nomic bases and improve the lot of their people. There was a ma:

 

 

e need for
capital to develop agriculture and industry, and to build the basic infrastructure.
The tasks facing the newly established Bank were enormous.

Thirey vears later, rhe region has become the world’s fastest-growing. It now
enjoys a remarkable degree of self-sufficiency in food. Its export-led industrial
initiatives and improved international competitiveness, supported by appropriare
institutions and policies to encourage the private sector and facilitate investment,
ormation that has drawn the admiration of the

 

have sparked an economic transi

 

world.
Ac the same time, there have been steady improvements in the quality of life.
Poverty rates have gone down with increased income opportunities on farms and
in factories. People now enjoy generally better nutrition and health, and, as a
consequence, the expectancy of life has improved substantially
The Bank has been an integral player in this transformation, growing as the
region grew, and keeping in s

 

ep with the changing needs of its developing
member countries (DMCs). However, the mere growth of the Bank's annual
lending commitments — surpassing the $1 billion mark in 1978 and $2 billion in
1984, and reaching $5.5 billion in 1996 — and its rechnical assistance and cofinancing
activities, as shown in the accompanying table (The Record, page 14) and box
(Operational Highlights, 1966-1996, page 15) reveals only a small segment of the
Bank's role in this transformation. A more complete picture of the Bank’

 

 

ICCESS.

 

as a development finance insticution over the past 30 years can be found in the
many, and olren not-so-obvious ways in which, during the various phases of its
operations, it has left its mark on the socioeconomic landscape of its DMCs.)
In the early years of the Bank, agriculture was the primary focus of irs
activites. Understandably, the sector is still a major target of Bank loans and
istance grants, since it remains the major source of employment in
most of the Bank's DMCs. The Bank has helped raise food production in rhe
region — thus contributing to the region's economic stabiliry — chrough its finane
 

technical as

 

ing of irrigation, livestock, and fisheries projects, input supplies, and extension
services, as well as through the provision of institutional credit, policy-based
program lending, and support for agricultural research.

When the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 hit DMCs and sent their economies
into a state of confusion, the financing of energy projects came into the limelight
of Bank operations. In response to the adverse impacts of the oil crises, the Bank
introduced the modaliry of program lending, which has

 

  

ince become an important instrument of policy reform in DMCs. Through its various interventions, the
Bank has encouraged its DMCs to work more actively for the development of
indigenous energy resources, and enhanced DMCs’ awareness of the need for
conserving energy and improving supply and demand efficiency.

The 1980s marked a pl
its_role_as_a f

   

when the Bank began to put greater emphasis on
_ Ol clopment, in addition to its continuing role as a
\ financier of development projects
Bank as a regional development resource center. Research into, and conferences

 

A conscieus effort was made to promote theand seminars on, regional development issues became an active part of the Bank's
sctivities. In the regional development debate that the Bank thus helped generare, the role of the private sector came to occupy a place of increas

 

ng importance.
Through its own catalytic investments and financing operations — beginning with
its first direct equity investment in a private sector enterprise in 1983, and its first
direct loan to the private sector without government guarantee in 1986 — as well

 

as through its policy dialogues, the Bank has played a role in strengthening the

 

atforts of its DMCs to promote the private sector as an engine of economic growth.
Arthe same time, the Bank began to pay increasing attention to the cofinancing
of projects. By actively promoting this activity, the Bank has been able zo induce

commercial capital, in addition to investments from official sources, into

  

development projects which commercial financiers would not otherwise have
found attractive. This has provided the DMCs, particularly the poorer ones, with
much-needed additional financing support for undertaking priority projects to
raise the living standards of the poor.

This catalytic role also Jed the Bank during the 1980s to get involved in the
development of the DMCs’ financial sector and capital markets. This has
developed as an important Bank activity. The purpose has been not only to
improve the climate for private enterprise, but also to strengthen the mobilization

 

of privace saving to supplement official development resources.

As early as 1970, the Bank pioneered the birth of the Samurai bond market
when it issued the first-ever yen bond in the domestic Japanese marker. There has
been a number of instances since then when the Bank’s borrowing activity has
helped develop the regional capital markets as well. In the early 1990s, its issues
of “Dragon bonds" — US dollar public bonds launched simultaneously in the
capital markets of Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taipei,China 
 

OVERVIEW

 

were hailed as an innovative activity.

The Bank has played a crucial role in fostering the idea of
regional and subregional cooperation among groups of countries to better exploit their comparative advantages for maximum economic benefit. Its work in the Greater Mekong
Subregion and on two “growth triangles” in Southeast Asia has
not only generated a great deal of enthusiasm among the
governments concerned, but has caught wide attention as procotypes for similar cooperation elsewhere.

 

Through its project, sector, and program lending activities, as well as policy dialogues, the Bank has certainly played
an important role in improving the policy, legal, and reenlatory
environment in its DMCs. Its interventions have impacted
particularly on micro issues such as tariffs, taxes, licensing, and
pricing, and the broader issue of good governance. By thus
helping define the criteria for development, the Bank has
widened the opportunities in irs DMCs for sustainable investment and growth.

Looking bac

 

 

  

on the past 30 years, the Bank can take pride
in these achievements, which present the best possible evidence

 

 

of its usefulness in che context of growth in the Asian and
Pacific region. Like « living organism, the Bank has been responsive to its envi
 

ronment, which has helped it survive and grow. The Bank has always been
mindful of the changing needs of its DMCs, and has responded to these changes

 

positively and creatively. Its introduction of quick-disbursing program loans in

1978 was followed in 1979 by multiproject loans, covering a number of small

projects in one or more sectors t meet the special needs of small countries. In
1980, sector loans were introduced wo finance @ cluster of subprojects within a
specitic sector or subsector. This gave DMCs a greater degree of flexibility which
they did not have before. In 1987, program lending policies were substantially
revised, shifting the focus from financing inputs to supporting medium-term
sector policies and adjustment programs. Further changes were introduced in
1996, making s a precondition for prog

There are other achievements that the Bank can highlight as it looks back
over the past three decades. It was during this period rhat several of its DMCs
reached the starus of newly industrializing eci
camples of the r

nomics, establishing themselves

 

 

as the leading e tion's economic muscle. These countries no

    

thus entering into a new relationship with ir altogether. It was also the period
when the People’s Republic of China joined the Bank (in 1986) as a member,
antly expanding the Bank's opera
for half the world.

However, the Bank cannot ignore the challenges
they remain as larg

 

signiti anal region, and making it truly a bank

   

 

ahead. Ina ditferent context,

as they were 30 years aga.

 

Despite the region's impressive record of economic growth, over 700 million
of its inhabitants still live in poverty. Some countries, and some groups within
countries, have either nor achieved sufficient rates of economic vrowth, or have
suffered from unequal distribution of the benefits af growth.

Degradation of the physical environment has become a

erious problem. The
pollution of land. water, and air resources is impinging sharply on the quality of
life chroughout the region. Air pollution, especially che concentration of particulates,

 

 

in many Asian cities is among the worst in che world. Soil erosion and deforestation

are devastating parts of the region.
Infant and child mortaliry rates in the region's rural areas far exceed those

 

in urban areas. In South Asia, these rates, on average, are more than six times
higher chan in industrial countries. Maternal mortality rates are 20 times higher.
Eliminating these problems requires improved access to safe water, modern medical facilities, better-trained health personnel, and @ more widespread immuniz

tion program.

 

Although primary school enrollments have increased significantly in the
past three decades, ¢
expected. Illiteracy rates continue co be higher in rural areas and among the

   

ender disparities in enrollments have not narrowed as

poor and women.
Rapid population growth remains a major concern for many DMC:
ing the problems of unemployment, underemployment, and poverty. In particular,

 

the region’s urban population continues to grow at an unrelenting pace. The
number of people living in cities has quadrupled between 1950 and 1990, and nine

Asian cities are counted ameng the world’s megacities. While the emergence of

 

megaciries can have a positive impact on economic growth, rapid urbanization

creates huge probe

  

of congestion and pollution, requiring massive investments

in housing, urban infrastructure, and secial services.

 

For che vasr majority of the region’s farmers, access to credit is not always
easy or adeguate, which is a major constraint in a region where agriculture is still
the primary occupation ot its people

over the past three decades, and shaped its strategy for the future. In its early
days, che Bank was predominantly a project lender, funding the region's needs in

These continuing

 

 

 

agriculture, industry, and intrastructure. Over che yearOVERVIEW

eee ee

ite and the needs of others began to change, questions of sustainable
velopment and quality of life became the major issues. In response, the Bank
ly transformed itself from a mere provider of development finance to

 

 

s grad
ore fundamental development catalyst.

Social and environmental concerns have become an integral part of the

k's operational strategies and approaches, because these have a direct
impact not only on the living conditions of the poor, but also on the very

phasis is given to projects supporting human development, particularly in

so behind the Bank’s increasing involvement in issues concerning women

  

 

use they have

 

 

 

in development and indigenous peoples.
While project lending remains the most effective means by which the
Bank can promote its development objectives, the modalities for such lending
jave Geen made progressively more flexible to suit the evolving needs of
DMCs. Recognizing the importance of a sound policy environment for s
ul development, the Bank emphz
onlinates closely with the Bretton Woods institutions to help improve the
macroeconomic framework in its DMCs.
Acthe same time, cofinancing of projects with other sources is being

 

Cess
policy dialogue on sectoral issues, and

 

emphasized

 

even more strongly to bolster the Bank's own caralytic role, and to help increase
capiral flows into its DMCs. The Bank has developed transparent procedures for
vcurement and consultant selection te ensure a level playing fiekl for all
participants in Bank-financed loan and technical assistance projects. Its active
couragement of the private sector, its work in support of the development of
smestic financial and capital markets, and its deeper involvement in insticutioni capacity-building issues, including the development of legal frameworks, have

 

| evolved from this one crucial concern: how tv make the socivecanomic develypment of DMCs sustainable.

Over the past three decades, che Bank has developed into a more mature and
focused insticurion, with a clearer idea of its role in the region's development. A
sharper country focus now gives the Bank a better feel of the DMCs’ needs, and
i it co work wich them in a more meaningful way. The Bank monitors the

 

quality of its projects, and is very conscious of the need to improve its operational
efficiency. It pays a great deal of attention to the management of its start and
budgetary resources, and exercises prudence in seeking additional resources. The
Bank is thus recognized as one of the most cost-efficient development finance

 

institutions. Also, through the adoption of an information disclosure policy, the

introduction of an inspection function, and greater cooperation with

 

nongovernmental organizations and other grassroots agencies, it has become a
more transparent and accountable agent of change.

As it prepares to enter che next millenium, the Bank looks at its mission in
the decades ahead as one of maximizing its development impact, not so much in
terms of lending volume as in terns of deploying all the instruments and resources
available to it to the fullest extent. It is in the areas of policy reforms, fiscal strenythening, good governance, capacity building, promotion of financial and capital markers,
subregional economic cooperarion, and environmental protection that the Bank sees
its most meaningful role for its furure development interventions. As President

Mitsuo Saro has said, “These are areas where we have definite comparative

 

vis other development agencies and the private sector.”

baThe Board of Directors

URING 1996, the Board of Directors achieved significant success
in the formulation and implementation of key operational and
policy initiatives.

General Operations

The Board met 48 times in formal sessions (including executive sessions) in
1996 and approved total lending and equity of $5,652.4 million for 89 projects.
Of this, loans amounted to $5,545.1 million ($3,879.5 million from ordinary
capital resources [OCR] and $1,665.6 million from the Asian Development
Fund [ADF]) and equity investments were $107.3 million. Governmentguaranteed loans were approved for 78 projects with the average project
size being $60 million over the total loan portfolio. Twenty-one countries
received Bank loans in 1996, including Uzbekistan, which received its first
loan in 1996, having become a member in 1995.

In addition to loans, the Board, either directly or through the authority
delegated to the President, also approved 286 technical assistance grants
totaling $175 million. All the approved projects were subjected to detailed
scrutiny, thus ensuring each met the Bank’s expectations in terms of
developmental effectiveness and compliance with Bank policy. Policy
requirements are broadly addressed by meeting the Bank’s strategic objectives
of economic growth, poverty reduction, social improvement, gender equity,
and environmental protection.

 

In addition to the formal meetings, the Board held nine seminars and
informal discussions. The agenda on these occasions covered a range of
diverse items including the Bank’s Three-Year Rolling Work Program and
Budget Framework (1997-1999), Country Operational Strategies, and
Assessment of Effectiveness of Bank Assistance in Capacity Building.

The focus of attention and the matter of paramount importance throughout 1996, however, was the sixth ADF replenishment and the negotiations
thereon. The Bank and donor countries achieved a measure of consensus
by the end of the year, and agreed in principle to the structure of the Fund,
the approximate amount of the replenishment, the parameters of the Donors'
Report, and a timetable for reconsidering policies relating to the management of the Fund. = *

Policy Issues

During 1996, the Board reviewed and approved a number of major policy
initiarives directed at increasing the Bank’s capaciry-building capability,
or enhancing its effectiveness from an operational perspective. These
initiatives are part of an overall framework designed to ensure the
continuing responsiveness of the Bank to the needs of its developing
member countries (DMCs). In this contexr, the following policy
developments and events are highlighted.

The Boards and Their Functions

THE BANK is governed by a Board of
Governors, which, at the end of 1996,
consisted of 56 members representing 40 regional and 16 nonregional member countries.
Under Article 28 of the Bank's Charter, the
Board of Governors is vested with all the
powers of the Bank. In turn, the Governors
delegare their authority to the Board of
Directors, except for certain powers reserved
to them under the Charter.

The Board of Governors meers in a formal session once a year for the Bank’s Annual
Meeting.

The resolutions approved by rhe Board of
Governors during 1996 and its membership
are shown in Appendixes | and 2, respectively.

Under the same Article, the Board of
Governors elects a 12-member Board of
Directors, eight elected by regional members
and four by nonregional members. Each
Director appoints an Alternare. The President
of the Bank is the Chairman of the Board of
Directors.

The Board of Directors performs its duties
ena full-time basis at rhe Bank's Headquarters
in Manila, Philippines, and meets in regular
formal sessions under the chairmanship of rhe
President. The Directors exercise their
authority and functions through rheir quarterly
and annual supervision of the Bank's financial sratements, their annual approval of the
Bank’s adminisrrative budget, and their continuous review and approval of policy documents and all loan, equity, and technical
assistance operations.

The Board of Directors and che members
they represent are shown in Appendix 3.

Operational Policy Development — Program Loans: The Bank introduced —
important changes to its program lending policies. A new sector development program approach was introduced; sector analysis became a precondition

_ for program lending.

Internal Policy Development — Human Resource Strategy: The Board
reviewed and approved the current human resource development policy,
which has as its major focus the continuing development of sraff, the strengthening of core competencies, the enhancement of sraff productivity, and rhe
promorion of staff morale and professional growth.

Institutional Development — Asian Development Bank Institute: The
Board approved the establishment of the Asian Development Bank Institute
(ADBI), which will be located in Tokyo and fully financed by the Government
of Japan. ADBI presents an exciting opportunity for the Bank to extend its
capabiliry of providing a learning environment for skill-building, and the
pursuit of intellectual understanding of economic and social development
issues in the Asian and Pacific region. This initiative underpins the quintessential nature of development banking, which aims to support country and
regional economic growth by encouraging rhe implementation of appropriate policies designed to stimulate economic acrivity and reduce poverty.
Such strategy relies on the capacity of well-qualified indigenous people to
implement the necessary reforms. Hence, there is a need for the proposed
training and development focus of the Institute.

Institutional Representation — Representative Offices: The Bank opened
two representative offices (Europe and Japan) which will enhance public
awareness about the Bank and its activities, and approved two resident
missions (Cambodia and Viet Nam) which will assist in project
implemenration.

Board Committees

Audit Committee: In 1996, rhe Audit Committee of the Board iner on
15 occasions. It reviewed ten project performance audit reports (PPARs),
two technical assistance performance audit repotts, three reevaluation reports,
one impact evaluation study, and one special study (see box on page 19).
Other topics discussed by the Committee include the revised Guidelines for
Preparation of PPARs, the Bank's system for evaluating and rating projects,
and the review of the Bank’s internal controls, due ro commence in 1997.
The Committee also reviewed the 1995 Financial Statements with che
Bank's outside auditors, and oversaw the activities of the Office of the
General Auditor. It recommended to the Board the selection, by competitive bidding, of new outside auditors for financial years 1997-2000.

The Committee presented its annual report to the Board of Directors
in June 1996. In the Report, the Committee noted that action had been
iniriated to address ongoing concerns such as beneficiary participation and
dissemination of lessons learned from postevaluation. However, it recognized
that the test of the various guidelines that had been introduced was in their
implementation, and in the evaluation of their impact on project
implementation.THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The Committee welcomed the ongoing review of the Bank's project
evaluation and classification system. It highlighted the importance of having
a system that was simple and practical, and which was applied consistently
to remain credible. At the same time, the Committee expressed the need
for the Bank’s system to be consistent with those of other multilateral
development banks (but also take into account the Bank’s specific needs) to
facilitate comparisons between the Bank and these organizations.

Regarding benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) in the Bank's
DMCs, rhe Commitree drew attention to the need for greater ownership of
BME activities in the executing agencies in the countries concerned. Until
executing agencies perceived BME as fulfilling their needs, they would not
be willing to commit the resources needed to make BME successful. The
Committee looked forward to the results of the Bank's technical assistance
activities in the Greater Mekong Subregion to assess its BME assistance in
five countries in that subregion.

Finally, the Committee acknowledged the progress made on issues
related to project design and implementation. Noting the wider application
of the logical framework in project and technical assistance design, it
recommended that the logical framework be mandatory for all projects and
technical assistance to set clear, monirorable objectives and indicators.
With respect to project implementation, the Committee welcomed the
introduction of mandatory midterm reviews and greater use of the Bank's
resident missions for monitoring project implementation.

Budget Review Committee: The Budget Review Committee was convened
from 11 to 21 November [996 to review the Bank's operations during the
year. Members discussed the work plans of various departments and offices,
deliberated on substantive issues underlying Management’s 1997 Budget
proposal, and reached a consensus on its recommendations.

The Committee noted the progress in the implementation of the
recommendations of the Task Force on Improving Project Quality. In
addition, it stressed the need for effective and sustained implementation
of policies relating to good governance, assessment of social impact of
projects, participation of beneficiaries, and enhancing capacity within
the Bank’s DMCs.

The Committee recognized that the 1996 performance of the Bank
reflected a significant improvement, given current staff and other budgetary
resource constraints. The Committee appreciated the efforts mace to improve
the representation of women in the professional staff of the Bank and urged
that such representation be increased, particularly in higher-level positions.
It welcomed the envisaged replacement of the Bank's outdated mainframe
computer, and the upgrading of the Bank’s computer systems, particularly
in the context of improving staff efficiency and in enhancing productivity.
Evaluating the work of the resident missions in DMCs, che Committee was
pleased to note that the capacity for project implementation of resident
missions had been strengthened, and that further delegation of project
aduinistration work was planned. It noted that the creation of the selfcontained Office of Pacific Operations had enhanced the country focus of
the Bank’s operations in the Pacific region.

The Committee reiterated the need for the Bank to continue its role
as a catalytic agent in the DMCs, and emphasized rhe conrinued need for

the Bank to recognize and promote the private sector, including small and
medium enterprises, as a major contributor to development. It also noted
that both loan and technical assistance disbursements and public secror loan
approvals in 1996 exceeded the planned targets for the year.

Finally, the Committee recommended that the Board approve the
administrative budget for 1997, and authorize an expenditure of $199.5 million,
representing a 5.3% increase over the 1996 revised estimate. This administrative budget will support $5.5 billion lending, $154 million technical
assistance, and $3.5 billion cofinancing programs in 1997, with no growth
in the authorized staff positions (see Appendix 4).

Inspection Committee: The inspection policy, approved by the Board in
late 1995, provides a formal channel through which local groups in the
Bank's DMCs can request an independent review or “inspection” of the
Bank's role in public sector development projects that affect them. The
policy complements other efforts to improve the qualiry and transparency
of the Bank's operations, as well as its accountability. Under the policy, a
new standing committee of rhe Board, the Inspection Committee, was
appointed in March 1996, and a roster of independent experrs was appointed
in October 1996.

The role of the Inspection Committee is to review any request for
inspection that is received, and to recommend to the Board whether the
request should be investigated. Any inspection approved by the Board will
be carried out by a panel drawn from the roster of independent experts. This
inspection panel will report its findings to the Inspection Committee, which
will forward the panel's report and its own recommendations to the Board
of Directors.

During 1996, the Inspection Committee reviewed and approved detailed
Inspection Procedures, which are available to the public. These Inspection
Procedures, and general information on the Bank's inspection policy, are
included in ADB's Inspection Policy: A Guidebook. Similar information on
the inspection policy has also been added to the Bank's Internet Home Page.

During 1996, the Inspection Committee did not receive any requests
for inspection. The Committees of the Board of Directors are shown in
Appendix 5.

Directors’ Visits

The Board of Directors undertook two group visits in 1996: the first to the
Pacific countries of Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Tonga,
and Tuvalu from 9 to 26 March; and the second to the Central Asian
republics of Kazakstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan from 27 August
to 10 September, The purpose of group visits is to enable Board members
to better understand firsthand the needs of DMCs, and thereby support and
encourage Bank initiatives in respect to the countries concerned. In all
countries visited, the Board had wide-ranging policy discussions with
government ministers and officials and business representatives, and took
the opportunity to visit the sites of ADB-financed projects. In the Pacific
countries, Board members had the honor of meeting the President of rhe

The Development and Management

of Asian Megacities

Executive Summary

A. STHESHIFT from agrarian to industrial economies proceeds in Asia,
i the trend of migration to urban areas will continue. The management
of megacities, vast urban areas with over 10 million persons, will play a key
role in Asian economic development into the next millennium. Even taking
into account official United Nations (UN) forecasts of declining population

owth rates over the next 30 years, rhe population living in Asian megacities
will more than triple, from 126 million in 1995 to 382 million in 2025. There
will he 20 megacities in Asia by 2025, ten of them in South Asia. This
megacity growth will take place in a period of major economic and technological change, dominated by the emerging global economy, a revolution
in information technologies, and an increasing emphasis on market-based
decision-making. These new external influences mean that megacities are
competing with each other, and some will do better than others. If they are
well managed, megacities can be productive and provide a high quality of
life for their residents. If not, the megacities' producrivity and the quality
of life they offer will be adversely affected.

Although they have the porential to offer their residents a full and
satisfying quality of life, megacities all too often are beset by growing
problems of environmental deterioration, inadequate housing, and social
ulienation and insecurity. Since economic growth is the fundamental underlying determinant in improving quality of life in megacities, there would
also be a need to provide adequate infrastructure to improve the producivity and efficiency of megacities to maintain their attractiveness for investors. For the less well-off megacities, the most urgent actions required
include reducing poverty, improving the environment, and strengthening
everall management capabilities. At higher levels of development, demand
management and reduction in pollution and congestion become more
important. It will be critical for governments to develop a holistic vision of
the megacity evolution, involving the whole range of city interest groups
in the decision-making process. |

The infrastructure funding needed to enable megacities to sustain their
productivity and moderately improve their quality of life is estimated at
about $20 billion per annum at present, which is expected to increase to
40 billion per annum over the next decade. Traditional ways of financing
capital costs and recovering current costs will have to be supplemented
through development of public-private partnerships, enhancing user charges
and property taxes, and enabling access of local governments and their
agencies to financial institutions and markets. Although funding may not
be sufficient at presenr, it is crucial for megacities to anticipate the needs
of infrastructure and service provision now.

In the context of rapid growth and massive investment requirements,
there is a need and an opportunity for the Bank and other international

aid agencies to enhance their support for the development of the region’s
megacities. The Bank's capital investment funding, which may be provided
through both the public and private windows, may be expanded, with an
emphasis on transport, environmental improvement, and water supply, as
well as on the urban poor. However, an equally important role of the Bank
would be to serve as a catalyst for development by helping developing
countries explore policy and institutional options, and mobilize investment
funding from a variety of sources.

Part I: Trends
Emergence of Megacities

During the 30 years the Bank has been in existence, there has been a
remarkable transformation in the economies of many of the Bank’s developing member countries (DMCs) and a corresponding improvement in the
economic status, lifestyles, and expectations of their popularions. This economic transformation has been accompanied by a rapid growth in the Asian
urban population, from 0.4 billion in 1965 to 1.1 billion at present, and an
increase in the level of urbanization, from 22% to 33% (see Figure 1). There
has also been a sharp rise in the number of megacities.! Today, Asia has
nine megacities' — Beijing, Bombay, Calcutta, Jakarta, Osaka, Seoul, Shanghai,
Tianjin, and Tokyo — and it will soon have fout more, including Bangkok,
Dhaka, Karachi, and Manila (see map). Relative to their level of development, Asian DMCs have a greatet proportion of their urban population in
megacities than any othet region in the world.

These megacities have both positive and negative features. They generate a higher-than-avetage proportion of the nation’s output of goods and
services; ate centers of innovation in science, the arts, and lifestyles; contain
many of the cultural.assets of the country; and offer some of the best
opportunities for people to lead full and satisfying lives. Yet they also suffer
from a shortage of water, environmental pollution, traffic congestion, and
proliferation of slums, crime, and social alienation. With the increasing
globalization of business and industrialization of Asian economies, most of
the region's megacities will continue to grow and to play a significant role
in economic production, social organization, and knowledge generation. At
the same time, their quality of life and their productivity could be adversely
affected unless steps are taken to improve their management.

The last three decades have seen the emergence of advanced manufacturing and increasingly service industry-based economies in Japan, and
the newly industrializing economies (NIEs) of Hong Kong; Republic of
Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China, closely followed by similar trends in
the Southeast Asian countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and

 

! A megacity is defined as a large metropolitan area with a complex economy, a large and
highly skilled labor force, and a cransportation system capable of maintaining daily
communications among all its residents. A threshold population of 10 million is used to
define megacities in DMCs for the purpose of uniformity. In many cases, this population és
for an extended area beyond the administrative boundaries of the constituent municipalities.

Worldwide there are 17 megaciries. The eight megacities outside Asia include Bueuos Aires,
Cairo, London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, New York City, Rio de Janciro, and Sav Paulo.THE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT CF ASIAN MEGACITIES
a

Philippines, and in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The least change
has taken place in the countries of South Asia where industrial growth has
been slower. This economic growth has led to the creation of relatively
wealthy industrial cities in the NIEs and Southeast Asia, and poorer cities
in South Asia. Throughout the region, urban population growth has been
high since rural-urban migration and natural growth in urban areas have
complemented each other. On average, rural-urban migration accounted
for about 40% of urban growth during the 1970s and 1980s. The con
equence of rapid migration and natural increase of population has been
thac cities such as Bombay and Jakarta have been growing by several
hundred thousand each year, population densities in inner city areas are
high, and several thousand hectares of rural land are being converted to
urban uses annually.

Some aspects of urbanization are distinctive to Asia. First, the impacts
ond implications of high growth rates in some of the largest cities of Asia
are unprecedented (see Table 1, page 26). Second, this rapid growth has
been taking place at a time in history when the impacts of free trade
associations, the globalization of decision-making on investment location,
and. the impacts of new information-based industries are having a profound

effect on manufacturing and service industry location, and hence on city
development prospects. Third, megacities are expanding in extended
metropolitan regions (EMRs), often covering distances of 50-100 kilometers
(kr) from the central city. In some cases, the EMR is given formal recognition,
such as in the Jakarta Metropoliran Region (ABOTABEK), the Bangkok
Metropolitan Region (BMR), and the Manila National Capital Region

(MNCR). Such EMRs contain a significant
share of rhe national urban population: 20%
in the case of JABOTABEK, 50% in the case
of BMR, and 15% in the case of MNCR.

Economic Development and
Megacity Growth

There is a generally well-established link
berween economic development and levels of
urbanization in Asia. Three broad groups of
countries can he identified at different poinrs
on the urbanization trajectory. The first,
represented by Japan and rhe NIEs, had per
capita incomes of over $3,200 per year in 1995
and levels of urbanizarion between 70% and
100%. The second, including rhe Southeast
Asian countries and the PRC, had per capita
incomes hetween $500 and $3,200 per yeat
and levels of urbanization between 23% and
43%, while the third group, including the
South Asian countries, had per capita incomes below $500 and levels of urhanization below 23%. Despite their lower overall
level of urbanization, the countries in the
third group will contain 10 of the region’s
20 megacities by 2025. Given this perspective, it will be important for them to establish,
as early as possible, the institutions and formulate the policies necessary to susrain the
development of their megacities.

There is overwhelming evidence of the
importance of megacities to the national
economy, measured by their contribution to
national output. In 1990, for example, Osaka
aud Tokyo produced 36% of Japan’s gross
domestic product (GDP); Bangkok, 37% of

Thailand’s GDP; and Manila, 24% of the
Philippines’ GDP. Average output per worker
is greater in megacities than in other urban
and nonurban areas, a rrend referred to as
“surproductivity.” In 1990, the ratio of city
GDP per capita to national GDP per capita
was 3.5 for Bangkok, 2.5 for Calcutta, 1.9 for
Manila, and 3.7 for Shanghai. What is theTHE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF ASIAN MEGACITIES

explanation for this economic dominance? The traditional reasoning is that
megacities benefit from the large skilled labor force and other agglomeration
economies that all cities enjoy to a greater or lesser degree. The other, more
recent cause is that megacities are a focus for much of the trade and services
arising from the global economy. The availability of a large and diverse labor
market contributes to both productivity and demand for intermediate and
consumer goods. High productivity arises from the megacity’s location and
function as a major meeting and transfer point in rhe movement of people,
goods, finance, and information, providing some of the best opportunities
for specialization in, and interaction between, socioeconomic, research,
education, and technology activities. It is true that other cosrs of operaring
in the megacity may outweigh economies of scale and force firms to move.
In many cases, the move is to a location just outside the main city, buc still
in the EMR, where the firm may still enjoy some of the benefits of the
megacity as transport and service linkages to the central city improve and
new commercial subcenters form. In other cases, it may be to different parts
of the country. There is evidence that this is occurring — for example, in
the Philippines, Cebu competes with Manila, and in India, Bangalore competes
with cities such as Bombay, Calcutta, and New Delhi.

Impacts of the Glebal Economy

There are two broad characteristics of the global economy impacring on
Asia’s megacities. First, the development of internarional markets for
goods and services is being encouraged by the World Trade Organization, large free trade zones such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference
(APEC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and
the creation of special economic zones in countries suchas the PRC. At
the same time, decisions on location by multinational firms are increasingly based on a comparison of labor and other costs across a range of
potential host countries. Such decisions are also influenced by the qualitative atrractions of alternative locations, as well as long-term economic
prospects for the country, investment incentives, the regulatory climate,
good governance, and political stability.

Second, there is an emergence of information-based industries, particularly financial services, as well as producer services, research and
development, media, and the headquarters of large companies. This
trend goes hand in hand with new techniques for the faster diffusion
of data and information. It might be expected that, given advances
in communications, such services would be located in more dispersed patrerns, but in fact the attractions of agglomeration economies and an innovative environment are major forces in favor of a
city location, particularly megacities. Agglomerarion trends are, however, taking new forms. While information-based industries, particularly those with a strong international orientation, will prefer a central
location, orher more traditional service industries may prefer cheaper
locations in the suburbs or elsewhere in the EMR. This is happening in
JABOTABEK, where industries are locating near existing towns on the
outskirts of Jakarta.

Despite these new influences, the informal sector is still very important
in many megacities. The role of the informal sector raises long-running

arguments over the “terms of trade” between the urban and rural sectors
and the function of migration into the megacity. It has been argued that
subsidies available for manufacturing, along with protectionist national
economic policies, have lowered returns to agriculture, leading to an urbanrural wage gap which has encouraged urban migration and resulted in
excessive urban unemployment. Recent data show, however, that rural
incomes are not uniformly below urban incomes, that informal sector
incomes are not always lower than formal, and that the majority of
migrants to the city do improve their standard of living. Policies must
ensure market-oriented terms of trade between urban and rural areas
and remove disrortions that adversely affect rural-urban migration. The
current trend to open up economies to market forces will help to reduce
urban-rural wage differentials.

Quality of Life in Megacities

Megacities in DMCs present an extremely varied picture of urban living.
In the more prosperous countries, megacities are providing, for many of their
population, living conditions and lifestyles of a similar standard to equivalent cities in developed countries, with the emergence of a middle class
concerned not only with education, health and social services, but also with
an increasing awareness of environmental issues. These megacities are in a
uansition from traditional quality-of-life risks such as waterborne diseases
and lack of medical resources, to modern risks such as air and industrial
pollution and stress-related illnesses (see Figure 2). The megacities of rhe
less-prosperous countries, particularly South Asia, presenta difficult picture
of extensive poverty, among others, with inadequate living conditions
particularly for the poor.

The quality of life in megacities, as elsewhere, includes concepts
which can be ineasured co some degree, ie., freedom from hunger,
capacity to live a healthy life, access to education, shelter and basic
services such as water supply and sanitation, and a secure and pleasant
environment at home and at work (see Table 2). Others, which are more
difficult to measure but which are equally or more importanr to the
household, include family stabilicy, absence of vulnerability, and involvement in the citywide community. While there is generally less
poverty in urban than rural areas, nevertheless urban poverty is a major
factor in megacities, particularly in South Asia. Other measurable indicators of health, nutrition, water supply and sanitation, shelter, and
education are all more favorable in urban than in rural areas. However,
the quality of life in megacities is often severely affected by other problems such as high cost of living, long journeys to work, pollution, and
crime. Such problems affect the urban poor in particular.

Megacities mean different things ro different people. For individuals
and families in rural areas, they represent the prospect of jobs, better schooling and services, and the chance to live fuller and more satisfying lives; and
many will join the ranks of migrants to the cities. Many of the urban poor
will have realized some of these ambitions, but often at the cost of living
in makeshift homes and struggling to make ends meet. For richer families,
living conditions may be ona par with the best in developed countries, with
the opportunity to live in separate neighhorhoods and as far as possihleTHE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF ASIAN MEGACITIES

insulated from the stresses of the rest of the city. For local and, increasingly,
incernational companies, well-managed megacities will offer some of the
best locations to do business.

Part I: Development Challenge of the Megacities

Evolution in the Next Thirty Years

The level of urbanization in Asia will increase sharply over the coming
decades. The urban population is forecast to more than double from about
1.1 billion to about 2.5 billion by the year 2025, by which time Asia will
contain half the world’s urban population. While the Asian and Pacific
region’s level of urbanization at present is relatively low compared, for
example, with Latin America, the level is forecast to reach almost 53% by
2025. A majority of Asia’s new urban residents will be living in six countries:
Bangladesh, PRC, India, Indonesia, Japan, and Pakistan. In addition ro
Asia’s nine existing megacities, 11 more, including Bangalore, Bangkok,
Dhaka, Hyderabad, Karachi, Lahore, Madras, Manila, New Delhi, Shenyang,
and Yangon will have reached megacity status. Of rhe total projected
20 megacities, half will have populations of 20 million or more, and ren will
be in Sourh Asia (see Figure 3, page 30).

What is the vision of megacity life over the next 30 years? While
megacities can be expected to dominate the economic transformation of

Asia, the quality of life for their residents will be very much related to the
quality of their management. This is not to say there are no fundamental
questions. For example,

* To what extent will megacities continue to grow?

* How can adequate housing be provided when land costs are so
high?

* Can megacities be beneficial to the environment as well as to the
national economy?

* Can traffic congestion and long travel times be avoided?

* Can sufficient funds and cost recovery be mobilized to deliver
adequate quality of life and sustainability?

While these questions cannot be answered fully as yet, there are many
lessons of experience and best practices that can be used to meet the needs
of the Asian megacities in the 21st century.

Economic growth should be the srarting point for meeting the development challenges for the megacities. At a time when the radical changes
being brought about by the global economy are only starting to impact
on Asia, it is difficult to make long-term forecasts. However, based on
the extrapolation of existing trends, economic growth in the high-income
countries of rhe region is likely to slow down somewhat as the gap
between their economies and that of the developed countries narrows.
Growth in the ASEAN region will continue, perhaps at slightly slower
rates than in the past decade. The economic prospects for South Asia
may improve significantly because of demographic changes (substantial
increases in the proportion of working age population) and economic
liberalization. Given the clear links between urbanization and economic
growth, it is inevitable that megaciries will continue to grow. Part of this
growth is prederermined by the natural increase of the exisring urban
population; the critical variable is rhe exrent to which rural areas in Asia
can absorb any more population growth, and tbe resulting impacts on turalurban migration.

The future structure of megacities, and the priority for interventions
to move toward quality-of-life goals, can be analyzed in three broad stages
along the path to full urbanization (see Table 3, pages 32-33). In the first
stage, typified by megacities in South Asia, the emphasis of interventions
will need to be on meeting the urgent needs of water supply, health and
nutrition, education, small-scale credir, and basic traffic management. In
the second stage, typified by megacities in the ASEAN countries, the emphasis
will switch, to addressing the problems resulting from rising affluence, such
as traffic congestion and pollution of all kinds, as well as the need to make
large investments in water supply and sanitation, wastewarer treatment,
flood control, and urban transportation systems. There will also be a need
to begin ro srructure the evolving EMR through strategic land use and
transport planning, to create an efficient land market, and to generate new
funding mechanisms and user charges to tap the increasing wealth. In the
third stage, the emphasis will be on consolidation of urban services to meet
high environmenral standards, redevelopment of inner city areas, investments in public transportation, and the use of market mechanisms and other
techniques to ensure sustainability.THE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF ASIAN MEGACITIES
a

Future Form and Structure of Megacities

While it is difficult to predict the impact on urban form of new technologies,
the general trend is likely to be toward dispersion of urban areas and the
further growth of EMRs, as has happened in developed countries such as
Japan and the United States (US). Environmental constraints will increasingly
alfect growth. For example, megacities such as Bangkok, Dhaka, and Jakarta
are situated on low-lying extensive plains, increasingly subject to flooding,
ground and surface warer contamination, and subsidence. Strategic guidance should be provided for the future expansion of urban land uses in the
EMR, as well as for the future of the existing built-up area Gee Box J,
page 34). Such guidance will need to use infrastructure-led planning to
encourage urban growth into areas where development costs are low and
key natural resources and ecological assets will not be affected.

Urban land uses in EMRs are likely to consist of exrensive areas of lowdensity housing and commercial buildings, with higher densities along road
corridors leading from the central built-up area. In addition, several, higherdensity subcenters are likely to emerge at key points, such as main road
intersections that, over time, may grow to become more self-sufficient urban
centers. Agricultural land near megacities will shift to horticulture and
market gardening as farmers aim to meet the needs of large and growing
urvan markets. While urban growrh in the EMR may not resemble a planned
and tidy city, it will be a cost-effective way for low-income families, real
estate developers, and the public sector ro gain access to affordable land and
al ivast a minimum level of services which can be upgraded over time. Mass
transit systems may be introduced late in the second stage of megacity
development, and can help to structure the EMR. There will be continuing
risks of environmental damage, but these may decline as industry and the
community begin to understand the ways in which such protecrion can be
introduced, which do not excessively add to the costs of the business concerned. Within the main built-up area of the megacity there will continue
to be extensive areas of low-income housing and commercial activities
coexisting with high-income housing and high-rise offices. Over time, however,
most of these low-income areas are likely to be forced out as inner city land
values rise, and the land is converted to commercial use.

Although many aspects of megacity development are unique to Asia,
lessons can be learned from industrial countries. In addition, inegacities at
different stages in growth can utilize best practices from each other. For
example, Asian megacities will do well ro note the impacts of neglecting
the needs and affordability of inner city communities, and the resulting
social and economic impacts of depopulation in terms of crime, dereliction,
and other costs common to cities in developed countries. Asian megacities
are following trends observed in the developed countries for the extensive
tedevelopment of downtown areas to provide office facilities to meet the
neecls of producer-service complexes; this has already happened in Singapore,
and is beginning in other megacities such as Bangkok. In planning for such
tedevelopment schemes, a mix of uses should be encouraged, to include
tesidential apartments as well as shopping, office, and entertainment floor
space, in order that the area can enjoy 24-hour use and avoid the emptying
of the central area so common in cities in developed countries. Developed
countries may offer lessons on the impact of new information technologies

Box 1. Strategic Development of Metropolitan JABOTABEK!

METROPOLITAN JABOTABEK, which comprises the capital city of Jakarta and five
adjoining local governments, is an example of an extended metropolitan region. It

contains the largest concentration of indus in Indonesia, as well as the headquarfacilities.
It also contains a large amount of agriculture. Private land developers play a substantial
role in the development of JABOTABEK. In 1995, the region’s gross domestic product

per capita was $1,525, more than twice the national average. It has an urban popula

The region displays a diversity of quality of development. The larger urban

 

centers, focal points on roll roads, and new residential estates where the private
sector has been active, have reasonably good roads, drainage, water supply, and

and increased pollucion;

and energy saving on urban forms that are now being developed, especially
in Europe.

Megacity Management

At their best, megacities —as centers for the arts, sciences, and innovation — offer efficient business conditions, provide a better standard of services than in rural areas, allow a variety of cultures to coexist and thrive,
and provide a diversity of experience to all. At their worst, where city
management is overwhelmed by headlong growth, the quality of life is
duminished for everyone, in particular the urban poor, by growing pollution
and congestion, increasing crime and social dislocation, as well as a range
of environmental failures including increased flooding, groundwater deterivration, loss of high-quality agricultural land, and often an environmenta
“shadow” over the surrounding region. Without better interventions to
address these major problems, megacities will become even more congested,
polluted, unhealthy, expensive, and socially divided. A downwatd spiral wil
follow if inward investment is deterred: the megacity’s comparative advantage will disappear, the tax base will diminish, and there will be correspondingly fewer resources to manage the growing problems.

Can the problems be overcome? In nearly all cases the fundamental
gaps berween demand and supply are managemenr-telated, i.e., problems 0

xd governance, absence of clear development policies and coordination,
poor management of assets and services, and inadequate financial and
regulatory capacity.

Based upon experience around the world as well as in the region, anew
vision has begun to emerge, based on the following initiatives: (i) a shift
in rhe role of governments from being service providers to facilitators o
services provided by others; (ii) a move toward decentralization and strengthening of local governments; (iii) provision of services such as water supply
and public transportation on a profit-making basis, through public-private
partnerships wherever possible; (iv) development of access to private capital
through better financial management, improved regulation of markets, and
enhanced cast recovery; and (v) management of development through the
phased provision of infrastructure within well thought-out strategic plans.
The technical know-how exists to deal with the most urgent needs, be they
basic needs in the poorer megacities of South Asia, or the bigher-level
services in the richer megacities of Southeast Asia.

 

haproving Governance
'

Most Asian megacities have grown and diversified well ahead of the capacity
of existing institutions to manage their growth. Historically, they have been
governed under a variety of institutional structures, including provincial
status in Beijing, Jakarta, Shanghai, and Tianjan; two-tier systems in Manila
and Tokyo; and a combination of local government and development
authorities in Bombay, Karachi, and New Delhi; and intermunicipality
arrangements in Calcurta. The experience of these cities has been mixed:
where control of higher levels of government was relied on, as in Karachi,
development efforts suffered from a lack of responsiveness to local needs;
where local governments were relied on, as in Calcutra, progress was

35ANNUAL REPORT 1996

36

often slow; in all megacities, development of local governments, metropolitan institutions, spatial planning, and arrangements for coordination have lagged behind needs.

The instirutions necessary to manage a megacity are typically held back
in their development by a lack of a clear delineation of their responsibilities,
combined with a lack of necessary human and financial resources. It is
widely agreed that there is a need to strengthen local governments. This
will require sustained action, since they are large, complex, and have a
broad range of responsibilities. Some success has been achieved in Asia in
the creation of special-purpose agencies, able to operare in a market environment, such as the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority in Bangkok.

Most DMCs have embarked on programs to srrengthen their local
governments. One of the most comprehensive recent efforts has been the
enactment of the Philippines Local Government Code of 1991, under which
local governments were given increased autonomy, more responsibilities for
provision of services, and greater access to financial resources. Following
enactment of the Code, Manila’s local governments increased their development activities substantially. Before the Code, local governments had
limited access to funds, but now they have been able to improve their
financial position and’ to seek credit from public and private financing
institutions. In Metro Manila, Mandaluyong, Muntinlupa, and Quezon City
have all secured loans and credit lines, and others are about to enter into
similar arrangements.

The emerging global economy, new communications technologies,
and environmental concerns all have major impacts on the management
functions and spatial forms of the megacity. In many cities, there is a
growing web of interest groups in business, local communities, environmental management, and other sectors rhat increasingly wants more say
in policy development. In addition, the increasing concentration of
national economic development and urban population in EMRs suggests
that there may be a resurgence of interest in regional institutional structures. Because of the nature and scale of the megacity, especially where
it is developing in the form of an EMR, there is a strong need for
horizontal coordinarion of public and private actions involving options
such as metropolitan-wide institutions for specific sectors, more formal
groupings of local governments, and other forums that allow public and
private inrerest groups, including nongovernmental and community-based
organizations, to work together on the key issues. Governance issues are
now being given more focused atrention in Bank operations following
the adoption of a good governance policy, incorporating transparency,
accountability, predictabiliry, and heneficiary participation.

Market-based Approaches to Service Provision

An important tool in promoting economic efficiency is the use of marketbased approaches involving competition in the provision of services. Services
such as solid wasre management, public transportation, and water supply
can often be provided by the private sector, perhaps at a lower cost than
by che public sector. Appropriate regulation and pricing of the use of groundwater can reduce overuse and depletion of the groundwarer table, and
encourage use of piped water supplies that may have less environmentalTHE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF ASIAN MEGACITIES

impact. Where price incentives are used to reduce the use of less-efficient
vehicles, such as in Hong Kong, the overall level of service and accessibility
cn be maintained even where road space is limited. Governments must
adopt economic pricing policies and ensure that subsidies, to the extent they
are necessary, benefit those for whom they are intended. Where land markets
© nction well, affordable housing will be provided by private developers for
most of the population.

Public-Private Partnerships

‘fhe complexity and scale of megacities call for experience in technical and
management matters that can in many cases be better provided by the
private sector than the public sector. The type of cooperation will depend
va local conditions, but in general the comparative advantage of the public
sector is in setting goals and strategies for service delivery, and in planning,
regulation, and protection, while that of the private sector is in the
operation and maintenance of the services. Private sector involvement
in the delivery of urban services such as water supply, sewerage, toll
roads, and public transportation is likely to be contracted or delegated,

ther than ownership-based. Public-private sector cooperation can also
be achieved in land development, whereby the public sector addresses modernization of land administration and new forms of land development

echanisms, and where the private sector is involved in the provision of
offsite infrastructure. Enhanced participation of the private sector in the
potential areas will require the development of appropriate incentive sysrems and legal and regulatory frameworks, an area where there is a role for
the Bank as a catalyst.

Improved community involvement in decision-making on policies
and programs, as well as responsibility for the provision and maintenance of local infrastructure, is also essential. Over the last several
uecades, many cities have experimented with the development of neighborhood or community organizations, which are consulted on matters
such as planning of new development, implementation of infrastructure
improvement, and implementation of tariff or tax increases. In addition
to such formal public sector community organizations, there are often
informal, or private sector community organizations, which may participate in urban development, including chambers of commerce and industry, religious associations, and associations of slum dwellers. In many
DMCs, programs are being developed under which community organi
itions can be responsible for their own infrastructure development.
Over the next decade or so, it is anticipated that the participation of
community organizations in the sector can be strengthened — through
he development of procedures for their involvement in decision-making,
and of programs to support their involvement in the direct provision of
services.

Improving Economic Efficiency
Improving the economic efficiency of the megacity is a high priority. This

need not necessarily be obtained at the expense of sustainability. The
key objective is to reduce operating costs for industries serving both

national and international markets. This requires a joint public-private
approach to improving serviced land supply, improving transport and
communications links, ensuring reliability of energy and water supplies,
delivering satisfactory waste management and drainage, improving the
quality of labor markets, and improving information systems on land,
finance, and other elements of the megacity economy. Incorporating the
resources of the informal employment sector into the citywide economy
will be important, especially in the South Asian megacities where “informal” employment accounts for some three quarters of all jobs. A
priority will be to make market entry easier for tbe small business through
better security of tenute, access to land, and credit, and modification
of regulations to allow mixed use of land, and affordable planning and
building standards. In addition, megacities need to adopt an entrepreneurial approach in promoting themselves to potential investots, requiring a joint approach by city administrarors and the private sector, as is now
happening in Manila.

Reducing Poverty

The causes of, and remedies for, urban poverty are complex and crosssectoral. While economic growth is fundamental for reducing poverty, there
are other direct intervention strategies that can help rhe poorest households
make better use of their main resource — their own labor. Programs of
primary education and health care, which have been shown to give higb
social rates of return; training programs; use of labor-intensive public investments; promotion of urban small-scale credit, which can mirror the
success of the rural-based Grameen Bank in Bangladesh; nutrition programs;
slum improvement programs, possibly including cross-subsidy elements; and
provision of secure land tenure, are all needed in a multisector approach
to the problem. The Bank has a prime objective of reducing poverty in Asia,
and is addressing the problem as an integral part of its policies on health,
population, education, and orher sectors.

Efficient Use of Energy

The more efficient use of energy in megacities is another example of the
need for cross-sectoral development strategies that can help sustainability.
The use of energy pricing and raxation, for example fuel taxes, can have
a strong impact on teducing congestion and pollution, as in Hong Kong and
Singapore. The promotion of denser forms of residential expansion attractive to public transport operators can reduce ovetall energy use in transport.
Policies that encourage the use of cleaner fuels can bring major reductions
in air pollution, as is being done in Bangkok. Such innovative energy
policies are still at a very early stage in Asia, but over the next decades may
bring substantial benefits.

 

Improving Rural-Urban Linkages

The growth of megacities is blurring the distinctions between urban and
tural development strategies. In EMRs, for example, changes in agricultural practices, che growth of seasonal migration to the city, betterTHE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF ASIAN MEGACITIES
0 Se SN SS

access ro major urban markets, and working part time in “urban” and
part time in “rural” occupations, are all examples of opporrunities for
amare integrated approach ro regional development around the megacity.
The infrastructure of a megaciry, which may extend for hundreds of
kiometers into its hinterland, can benefit the residents of nearby rural
areas. This strategic approach is being followed in the JABOTABEK
region of Indonesia, in which interventions are used ro support the
growth of subcenters in the EMR, both as counterbalance to the growth
of rhe central urban area, and as centers for the provision of market,
financial, technical, and social services to the surrounding rural areas.

Providing Water Supply and Sanitation

T ec methods of obtaining and using water in DMC megacities are varied,
ranging from complete reliance on piped water supplies, to use of a mixture
of piped water and other water sources, to complete reliance on sources sucb
as wells. Only a portion of the population of most megacities have a
source of potable water, and the rest need to protect themselves by
disinfecting, boiling, or filtering their drinking warer, or by buying it in
containers. The lack of potable piped water in most megacities in the
region has led ro a substantial incidence of waterborne diseases — in both
the poorer cities and in the poorer areas of the better-off cities. Waterrelated problems in megacities include low reliability of supply, poor
quality, uncontrolled rapping of groundwater, inadequate access to piped
water, and little provision for wastewater disposal. While the institutional performance of water utilities varies across the region, the shortcomings are generally related to inadequate autonomy in decision-making
and staffing, high levels of unaccounted-for water (e.g., 55-60% in the
case of Jakarta and Manila), and the need to improve financial performance
through efficiency gains and tariff restructuring.

While water supply improvements have enjoyed a fairly high priority in mosr mnegaciries, sanitation has lagged behind. In some of rhe
South Asian cities, substantial investments have been made, but institutional weaknesses and a lack of cost recovery have held back further
development. Until recently, the focus was primarily on human wastes,
but now industrial pollution is becoming a problem and there is a need
to address such problems. This is being done in Katachi (see Box 2, page
40). Central sewer systems are affordable for a majority of the population
only where incomes exceed $1,000 per capita; hence, the poorer cities
have to prioritize their activities carefully. A phased approach for the
provision of water supply and sanitation could be followed (see, Figure 4,
page 41).

In the context of increasing demands and the need to tap resources
turther from the city core, integrated water resource management has
become a serious issue. Realistic pricing of water, based on the concept
of water as an economic as well as a social good, can be effective in
demand management. Combined with measures to reduce unaccountedfor water, water conservation and more widespread recycling and reuse
of treated water in both industry and agriculture, can reduce pressure
on scarce water resources.

Box 2. Korangi: The Forgotten Industrial Area of Karachi

THE ALMOST 10 million people of Karachi are frequently exposed to
health risks and unpleasant envirenmental conditions due to the shortcomings of industrial and municipal wastewater management. Particularly in low
 

income slum areas (kerchi abadis} and industrial areas, raw sewaye flows in
gutters, open drains, and dry river beds, exposing the inhabitants — particularly
the urban poor, women, and chilelren — to diseases. To alleviate the problem,
the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) began in 1986, with Bank
assistance, to improv idation ponds to purify
wastewarer. When sewage treatment works constructed under three Bank loans

sewerage and to construct 0%

     

became operational, polluted coastal waters gradually began to recover. Soon
the bulk of Karachi’s sewage will receive biological treacment, except in the
forgotten industrial area of Korangi, an area which covers abour 20% of Karachi
and is home to nearly 1.4 million people.

In the 195¢s, Korangi was developed with estates of low-cost tract housing
for immigrants from India. In the 1960s, a railway line was constructed, and
large industries began to move to Korangi. Now about 2,500 in number, these
industries are dominated by leather canneries and chemical, textile, pharma
 

ceutical, and food-processing factories. The industries provide employment to
residents, but release noxious and hazardous industrial effluents. Their wastewater is laden with lead, mercury, chromium, selenium, toxic halogenated

organic compounds, and a variety of other dangerous chemicals. In North

 

Korangi, farmers who had irrigated vegetables and livestock fodder using water
from the Malir River began, as the river dried up, to use raw sewage for
irrigation water. Alchough the nutrient-rich sewage produces a larger, denser,
and faster-growing crop, industrial toxic wastes find their way into the sewage,
and are taken up by the vegetables, posing a severe health risk to all who
consume them. Korangi’s sewers were almost totally destroyed by a 1977 flood
of the Malir River, and have nor been repaired properly. Flood protection
bunds have been constructed, but excavated openings allow raw sewage ro
flow into the dry river hed, coastal estuaries, and the sea.

 

 

In response to proposed industrial effluent standards, Korangi industrial associations formulated their own plans to control industrial wastes
ro meet environmental standards, and initiated studies to a

  

B

es8 wastewater treatabilicy. Funding was obtained for heavy-metal recovery plants and
pretreatment facilities, after calculations showed recovery of metallic wastes
and chemicals from industrial effluent would become commercially viable
and self-sustaining.

KWSB requested the Bank to consider Korangi for investment, and hired

 

consultants to design a trunk sewer and oxidation pond to convey and treac
Korangi's domestic and industrial sewage to meet effluent standards, including
complete replacement of the sewerage network, institutional strengthening,

 

and staff training. The Project, to be appraised in 1997, is expected to result
in capacity building and construction beginning in 1999. Capacity building in
KWSB will focus on improving (i) environmental management, (ii) financial
management, (iii) operator skills, (iv) communicy relations, and (¥) private
sector involvement in service provision. By the year 2003, Korangi residents
and industries alike will benefit from sewage collection and treatment, and
improved quality of coastal waters. Korangi industrial associations may become involved in wastewater operation and maintenance. or outright ownership of the Korangi portion of KWSB's assets. After more than two decades

ect, Korangi will have finally been remembered.

Many of the most pressing problems of Asian megacities
concern environmental deterioration, and the consequent a
unpact on sustainable urban development and quality of
life. On a regional scale, air pollution produced by
megacities may affect nearby agriculture and forest reserves, waterborne and solid wastes, unless reduced and/
or treated, adversely affect water resources and fisheries,
as is now happening in the Gulf of Thailand; and con

{ land, water, and air are well documented. With a low e
level of sewerage and substantial discharge directly to
surface drains or into deep pits, the situation is becoming

otentially epidemic causing in many megacities. Such
liquid waste problems are compounded where solid waste
collection and disposal are inadequate. Excessive use of
»roundwater in coastal cities such as Jakarta, Karachi,
and Manila is leading to saline intrusion. Virtually all

 

surface waters in Asia become severely degraded on en- ~

tering urban stretches of waterways, the main cause being
industrial wastewater. The experience of Seoul indicates
tuat this can be cleaned up.

Air pollution is seriously affecting environmental conditions in the
region’s megacities — with Beijing, Calcutta, Manila, New Delhi, and Shanghai
being among the most polluted cities in the world — and is also causing
vegetation damage by acid rain. The economic impacts of pollution, in terms
of loss of productivity and health costs in urban areas, have been estimated
to range between 1% and 5% of their GDP.> Besides economic costs, there
are orher significant impacts of air pollution, such as ill health, loss of work,
luss of amenities such as the enjoyment of a natural area, and lost leisure
Lime spent in traffic jams. Tbe technical solutions to pollution problems are,
in general, available, and studies show that both industries and households
are often willing to pay for these solutions. The question has to be asked:
vhy are remedial measures not being taken at a scale to reduce such serious
pollution levels in Asia's megacities? The answer may lie in the policy,
institutional, and market failures that affect the environment sector.

The environment of the megacity and EMR is at the heart of the issue
of sustainable urban development, and policies and strategies to move toward
this objective need remedial actions to overcome existing environmental

: hazards, as well as preventive actions to forestall future
environmental degradation. First, there is a need for
clearer allocation of responsibilities for macro-level
decisions, including pricing policies, institutional and
management systems, and better use of regulatory

| systems. Second, the “pofluter pays” principle is vital
hin enhancing environment-related services. Third,
polluters need the righr incentives to reduce pollution
(see Box 3, page 43). While economic instruments have
not been widely used in Asia, there are some successful
examples, such as effluent charges in Malaysia and
differential fuel taxes in Thailand. Fourth, many
environmentally sustainable actions will only bring

to user charges. Questions of equity arise, therefore, in

terms of the proportion of environmental protection
that should be paid for by existing and future residents and businesses.
Finally, while environmental problems in megacities are acute, their
characteristics may present environmental management opportunities
not available co smaller cities. For example, higher residential densities
allow economies of scale in the provision of infrastructure; higher average urban incomes increase affordability and willingness to pay for
environmental improvements; environmental education and public awareness campaigns can be effective because of higher standards of literacy
and communications; and where megacities are compering for global
investment, they are likely to give higher priority to environmental upgrading
as part of the marketing effort.

Improving Transportation

While transportation has always been important to cities, it is critical to
sustainable megacity development. The sheer scale of megacities puts enormous demands on transport systems capable of moving large volumes of
passengers and freight at affordable costs. In most megacities, this demand is noc mer, leading to the familiar problems of congestion and long
travel times (many of Manila's urban poor, for example, travel as much
as two hours each way to get to their jobs). In most of Asia’s megacities,
plans have been prepared for primary road improvements, but few of
these cities have well-integrated systems of primary, secondary, and
tertiary roads. Also, many lack road space in their central core areas.
In the early stages of their development, megacities need to improve
their traffic management and support the development of an efficient
public transport system, primarily based upon buses. At later stages of
their development, bus systems can be linked to Jight rail transit systems,
and eventually to new mass rapid transit (MRT) systems. Several Asian
megacities are beginning to develop mass transit systems, planned to be
extended to serve the EMR and act as catalysts for development of
priority subcenters. Strategies to develop MRT in association with new
commercial and/or real estate floor space, as in Hong Kong, can be partTHE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF ASLAN MEGACITIES

Large-scale transport investment is characterized by long time frames
for planning, design, and construction, as well as high costs. Such
investment highlights other factors that are critical in overall megacity
‘ransport strategies, i-e., the links (or lack chereof) between land use and
transport planning (see Box 4, page 44), and the roles of the public and
private sectors at each stage of the transportation process. While private
investors may be keen to develop new large-scale transport projects, ir

Box 3. Wastewater Management in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region

THE POLLUTION of water bodies has reached
extreme leveis in the Bangkok Metropolitan
Region (BMR). The BMR, which contains
ibout 80% of Thailand's industrial base, has
in existing population estimated at almost
i0 million and a projected population in 2023
ot almost 23 million. The majority of household, commercial, and industrial wastewater
in the BMR is discharged into the stormwater
drainage system with no treatment, or with
pretreatment only. In addition, the BMR contains pig farms with about 2 million pigs generating wastewater loads equivalent to abour
6 million human residents. The existing wastewater generation trom all sources within the
BMR is abour 4.5 million m?/day and will increase to about 6 million mv} day by the year
2015. The Government

economy will contribute to a worsening situ

ation unless concerted action is taken. As a
result of the present waste loads, most of the
canals traversing and downstream of Bangkok
are so heayily polluted as to be dangerous to
the health of the users, and is adversely
affecting the fishing industry in the Gulf of
Thailand.

In 1992, a new environmental law resulted in the designation of the BMR as a
Pollution Control Zone, which empowered
the Pollution Control Department (PCD) to
develop an action plan for we

 

tewater management on a regional basis, as well as to
monitor polluters and enforce compliance. One
of the first steps taken by PCD was to update
the Bangkok Wastewarer Master Plan
previously based upon 40 expensive separate
collection and trearment systeus.

With the help of a Bank technical assi
tance, PCD has prepared an everall \
water Management Action Plan fer the BMR.

 

 

aste
The recommended long-term wastewater
management strategy for the BMR comprises
(i) six separate wastewater collection and tansfer systems serving various catchments:
(ii) wastewater treatment facilities using aerated lagoon, activated sludve, and advanced
secondary treatment processes; and (iii) disposal of effluent to rhe Chao Phraya River
(north), the Chin River (west), coastal waters
(east), and inland canals (southwest). Em
 

phasis is placed on industrial pollution prevention as the preferred option, to collection
and treatment of industrial wastes and in some
cases relocation of industries, which now produce amore hazardous flow of pollutants than
do households.

The Bank had earlier assisted PCD to
prepare and fund the Samut Prakara

  

Wastewater Management and Pollucion
Control Project. With a cost of $507 million and Bank financing of 3130 million,
the under-construction Project is d
to help alleviate pollution and improve water

ened

 

quality in one of the most heavily polluted
areas of the BMR. The Government plans
to proceed with similar projects in the rest of
the BMR.

The Government recognized in the early
stage of project planning chat the success and
sustainability of its investment in the BMR
wastewater management would depend on the
capacity to implement and operate the facilines. To help build up such capaciry, che Bank
is providing technical assistance to facilitate
public participation, cost recovery, and pollution prevention, and to strengthen project
management capabilities. Technical assistance
has also been provided to assist the Government to establish public-private sector partnerships for building and operaring wastewater management facilities.

is essential for governments to adopt and maintain a consistent transpart
policy, and to decide on the key issues of policies for choice of system,
land availability, acceptability of elevated structures, sources of investment, fare policy, and other questions. This lesson has been learned in
Bangkok, where for a number of reasons private sector involvement in
the MRT was delayed. A stronger coordinating structure has now been
established, and a new framework for bidding transport concessions is
now operational. Another key lesson is that a strategy for public transit
must be developed, and only then can policies for car use restraint be
effective. Even in megacities, MRTs, because of their great cost, can
only be realized in high-demand transport corridors.

In addition to the MRT, megacity transport policy needs to consider
improvements to toad-based public transport including buses, para transit,
taxis, and other forms of vehicles serving public needs. Catering to
private transport demand is also important as a high proportion of future
ttip-making will continue to be made by cars and motorcycles, and in some
megacities nonmotorized modes, such as bicycles and trishaws, will remain
prominent people-movers fot many years to come. Planning and management of the network will be crucial to optimizing the efficient use of road
space. Road hierarchies will need to be established, and area traffic control
systems expanded. In addition, traffic management schemes will require
continual development, including bus priority measures, junction
improvements, pedestrian separations, parking policies, and nonmotorized
facilities. Integration between the modes should be promulgated and practiced.

Box 4. Shanghai — Window on the World

SHANGHAI'S population of about 15 million is expected to increase to
27 million by the year 2025. Shanghai is the most important industrial base in the
People’s Republic of China (PRC), and is becoming an international cenrer for
service industry, particularly finance, trade, high rechnology, and information. The
ciry had an important historical role and was the largest ciry in East Asia before
After years of stagnation, proactive ecanomic reforms and liberalization

 

i¢s were initiated in the early 1990s, and the city is finally regaining its role as
a “window on the world.” Per capita gross domestic product (GDP} in 1993 was
almost four times higher than the national average, and GDP growth, in real terms,
has been 15% per annum in the first half of the 199¢s. Shanghai is the commercial
capital of the Yangtze Delta Region, which covers 20% of the PRC’s land area, has
one third of the country’s population, and contributes abour half of the national
outpur. There are 225 cities in the Region.

Shanghai has taken the lead role in the overall development of the Yangtze
Delta Region, with Pudong, a new city on the ease of the Hangpu River, serving
as the link with the rest of the PRC and international markers. Large investments
have poured into the development of Pudong, which is the site for more than
1,000 industrial development projects. Major infrastructure projects being implemented in the area include water supply, sewerage, flood protection, drainage, gas
supply, celecommunications, and transportation. Pudong is rapidly becoming a
new, high-technology metropolis, and an industrial and financial base with an
emphasis on the services sector.

One of the biggest challenges facing Shanghai is overcrowded transport
infrastruccure, and a rapidly deteriorating urban environment. There are indicationsTHE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF ASIAN MEGACITIES

Furthermore, considerable efforts need to be applied to fostering road safety
through physical measures, improved enforcement procedures, and roaduser education campaigns.
Overall, megacity transport policy has to address four key objectives:
(i) maximize the economic efficiency of the transport network, both existing
vad new; (ii) create a humane environment; (iii) help rhe poorest; and
(iv) create an efficient megacity structure. Actions to meet these objectives
include developing vehicle, fuel, and road pricing policies to ensure prices
ecr the total costs vehicles impose; developing efficient, responsive bus
services to meet the needs of most income groups; using major road investmenr to guide growth to desirable areas; and addressing the problem of
vehicle-generated air pollntion, inter alia, through use of nonleaded gasoline
(see Figure 5, page 46). Improved relecommunications networks can also
nake a stcong contribution to effective transport policy by helping reduce
the overall demand for business journeys across the megacity and EMR.

The role of land supply in supporting quality of life and sustainability

of households and locally based businesses. Several key components of

deregulare many elements of land use (for example,
by introducing incremental planning and building
standards to match affordability) to restrain land
price increases. Third, new public-privare sector partnetships need to be developed to match the high

governments can take the lead in assembling, analyzing, and disseminating information on land availability, land prices, and
other indicators, as well as current policies for the use of land. The Bank
has helped in strategic planning in Dhaka, and plans to support further
improvement of the landownership registration system.

Financing

Asia's megacities continue to impose staggering demands on fiscal resources.
Amounts ranging from $20 billion to $40 billion annually will be needed
over the next decade to provide services at levels sufficient ro sustain
productivity, and achieve some improvements in the quality of life. These
estimates include che capital costs of renewing existing infrastructure and
adding to it. Transport and communications, energy, and water supply and
sanitation will form the largest capital investmenc segments. In addition,
there are the corresponding costs of maintaining such infrastructure, and
delivering related services. It is difficult to predict what will happen if there
are shortfalls in the financing of megacity growrh and management. Obviously, some degree of urban blight will persist. The urban environment
will continue to be adversely affected in varying degrees. The quality of life
will improve, but less markedly than if full funding is ensured.
Traditional methods of financing the capital costs and recovering recurrent
costs will have to be increasingly phased out, as they indeed are. Taxes and
government borrowings are insufficiently elastic to allow predictable transfers to megacities. Megacity managers are also learning that such transfers
tend to induce inefficiency. It is recognized that they postpone access to
private capital, and inhibir che fashioning of fiscal instruments that make
megacity development attractive to the private sector. Cities are increasingly competing with one anether for domestic and foreign capital, with
competition being particularly acute among megacities. Local government

private sector participation should be supported, Grant-based central funding of urban infrastructure has to be supplemented by local means, both
pablic and private. Consequently, many governments are trying out new
anproaches. The Community Mortgage Program in the Philippines is an
innovative way of financing the housing needs of the urban poor. In Hong Kong,
ihe development of communication links with the new international airport
is planned to be financed in part by profits generated by property development. Toll roads, being constructed on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis,

Water supply concessions are being negotiated in Jakarta and Manila (see
Box 5, page 48). Guaranteeing repayment of private debt hy local governments is one way in which central governments can encourage increased
privare participation in funding megacity development. Accessing the capital markets through municipal or other bond issues, with or without gove-nment guarantee, is another way.

The compulsion of cost recovery is leading governments to recognize
the imperatives of price reform, and the levying of charges and fees that
meet the full costs of efficient service provision, manage demand, and
generate cash to catalyze new investments. There is a perceptibly heighterred awareness of the disproportionately high costs imposed by subsidizing megacity services. The impact of such costs is becoming all too
clear. Dhaka, Hyderabad, and Shenyang know that future costs of obtaining
wacer supplies will be three times current costs. Local governments are
being provided greater discretion in the levying of taxes, fees, and service charges. Manila has awarded the metropolis’ water supply and
sewerage services to private concession conttactors and substantive consumer benefits are expected. Singapore has shown that pricing road use
can work, and that the advantages are multiplied when licensing entry
into the city's central business district is coupled with an efficient MRT
system. Pollution fees, fuel raxes, and an increase in the rates of vehicle
taxes are being tried out as a means to decongest traffic in megacities.
Solid waste management services are increasingly being contracted out;
Bangkok and Seoul provide good examples of the effects of privatizing
pact of the services. Transporr services, too, are being deregulated to allow
private sector funding to leverage competition and cost-effectiveness.

Land, and the way it is used, will continue to dominate the financial
landscape of Asian megacities. Property and other land-based taxes remain
the mainstay of many local governments, even at relatively low levels of
collection. Such taxes need to be betrer structured to capture the economic
benefits to megacity residents, and must be accompanied by more efficient
systems of administration. Dhaka and Jakarta are making progress in this
respect, with assistance from the Bank. In Bombay, which has some of the
wetld’s highest property prices, rhe local government is unable to share in
the profits accruing to landlords because of weaknesses in the property tax
system. Large-scale real estate development must also be required to provide
the full range of urban infrastructure, both onsite and offsite, so as to serve
adjoining areas. Development of the Fort Bonifacio area in Manila is expected
to illustrate this concept.

In countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Pakistan, there is an
acute shortage of housing finance while in others, such as the Philippines
and Thailand, housing finance is becoming a significant factor in home

Box 5. Manila Water Supply

WATER SUPPLY and sewerage services are
provided to the population of Metropolitan
Manila by the Metropolitan Waterworks and
Sewerage System (MWSS). Although MW5S
produces an average 2,700 million liters of
water per day, it is able to provide water
supply services only to about 75% of the 10 million persons living in its service area, often
for only about half a day. The water supplied
by MWSS is porable in some, but nor all
areas. Sewerage services are provided to about
8% of the service area population.

MAW’SS has suffered from two chronic
operational constraints: high levels of
nonrevenue water (NRW’)! and accounts receivable. The NRW level has been 55% or
more, while accounts receivable have been as
high as 4.5 months’ billing. The high NRW
level is related to the fact thar many parts of
the distribution lines are aged and affected
by frequent earthquake tremors. There is a
need for repairs as well as for more frequent

testing and replacement of meters and re-~

duction of illegal connections. Accounts receivable have accumulated over the vears
partly hecause consumers who did not receive satisfactory services declined to pay,
and partly because MWSS* administrative
capacity has been inadequate to collect bills
efliciently.

To remedy the situation, in late 1995,
the Government of the Philippines introduced
private sector participation (PSP) in MWSS
water supply and sewerage services. An esti
 

mated 33-7 billion will be required to meet
the demand for water and s

  

werage over the
next 25 years. The Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) helped rhe

purchases and sales. The availability of adequate housing finance contributes to the creation of a strong and viable construction industry, and to the
deepening of financial markets. Particularly in the middle-income countries,
a strong housing industry can be a leading sector of the economy.

The Bank’s Evolving Role

Over the last 25 years, the Bank’s support for the development of Asia’s
megacities, which began in the early 1970s with water supply projects in
Bangkek, Manila, and Seoul, has gradually expanded to include support for
pollution control, sanitation, roads, bridges, slum upgrading, and integrated
urban development aspects, with coverage of five addirional DMC
megacities — Beijing, Dhaka, Jakarta, Karachi, and Shanghai. In the early
1980s, support was provided for sewerage and sewage treatment facilities in
Rangkok, Karachi, and Manila, and for low-income housing in Bangkok.
The scope of the Bank’s assistance was further broadened to include, in the
ate 1980s, integrated urban development projects in Dhaka, Jakarta, and
Karachi, and in the 1990s, urban environmental improvement and road and
bridge improvement projects in Bangkok, Beijing, and Shanghai. While the
vechnical assistance program was primarily focused on project preparation,
it has also encompassed issues-oriented studies such as urban land management and a wastewater management master plan for Bangkok, strategic
planning for Dhaka, metropolitan resource generation in Karachi, and
environmental planning in Seoul. Policy dialogue has involved improving
water resource and environmental management, providing services to the
urban poor, enhancing cost recovery, developing public-private sector partnerships, and institutional development. In the water supply sector, the
Bank has focused on reduction of unaccounted-for water, tariff reform,
sotporatization of water supply agencies, and related private sector participation. Improvernent of sector financing mechanisms has also been an
important area of emphasis. The total value of the Bank’s assistance for the
urban sector has been about $1.8 billion.4

In addition to its country-specific assistance programs, the Bank has
supported exchange of experiences and clebate about urban issues including
those of megacities, through a series of regional consultations and seminats.
The Bank’s recent seminars on Megacities Management and Urban Infrastructure Finance provided important contributions to the Second UN
Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat If} held in June 1996, including inputs to the DMCs’ national action plans and the Global Plan of Action
adopted at Habitat I]. Thesc seminars and conference have revealed that
DMC governments themselves are recognizing megacities as engines of
gtowth, whose effective management is essential to the economic development of the country.

Most DMCs have taken actions aimed ar improving the management
of their megacities, including creating revenue-eamning enrerptises in subsectors
such as water supply; strengthening local government institutions; improving cost recovery, and developing public-private sector partnerships. Most
have also prepared urban spatial plans, and expanded preparation of master

plans and feasibility studies for key sectors such as water supply and sanitation, drainage, and transportation. In some Asian cities, the water supply
sector now seems poised for takeoff and development to the levels indicated
by demand of the residents and businesses. In the other sectors, however,
and even in the water supply sector in many cities, the provision of infrastructure
services will continue to lag behind demand. In most cities, there is a
growing need to address problems of pollution and congestion; to cater to
the needs of the urban poor even as land costs increase; to address the
investment needs which far exceed the public sector resources available; and
to strengthen megacity institutions to meet the massive management chal\enges ahead in order that worsening living conditions and loss of productivity do not slow the pace of development in the region.

While helping countries expand resource mobilization froin domestic
sources and catalyze private sector participation, there isa need and opportunity
for the Bank and other international development agencies to expand
their support for the development of the region’s megacities. Based on
an assessment of the increasing subsecroral gaps, there will be the need
for an increased emphasis on transport, environmental improvement,
the urban poor, and development of public-private sector partnerships.
Development of efficient and well-integrated urban transportation systems is an urgent need in almost all megacities, and one as yet not
addressed well at any stage of development by any of rhe international
development agencies. In the higher-income cities, pollution control
and development of MRT systems may have priority. Environmental
sanitation improvements ate urgently needed in the lower-income
megacities, and these may be expanded progressively to cover industrial
pollution control, and the control of sewage and wastewater treatment
in the higher-income megacities. In the lower-income megacities, more
emphasis could be placed on poverty teduction, including slum improvement, and education and health. To be fully effective, most of this
support would involve public sector lending, accompanied by policy and
institutional development.

Until now, the Bank has financed only one private sector urban
infrastructure project, the Bangkok Expressway. Since the need and
opportunities are much greater, in addirion to its public sector lending,
the Bank could expand its private sector lending and equity investments
in urban infrastructure — focusing not only on water supplies and toll
roads, but also on environmenral sanitation and public transportation.
The development of urban infrastructure projects for private sector
financing requires consideration of public policy, private feasibility, and
risk-alleviation issues that the Bank, by virtue of its experience in public
and private sector funding, is uniquely situated to pursue. Furthermore,
the Bank could expand its support for capital market, housing finance,
and infrastructure finance systems, guarantee operations, and other similar
initiatives at the national level.

In the context of rapid growth and very large investment need, the
most important role of the Bank and other international development
agencies would be as catalysts — to help DMCs develop a vision for the
future, anticipate the scale and structure of their megacities, prepare
well-framed investment programs, and develop agenda of the policy and
institutional development actions needed to mobilize the massive resourcesTHE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF ASIAN MEGACITIES

required, and undertake targeted and selected interventions, and thus
maximize their developmental impact. DMCs need not only develop
their local governments, but also create new, metropolitan institutions
with well-defined functions and funding well suited to these facilities.
jn addition, they need to encourage their water supply agencies, tollway

ad rapid rail transit companies, and local governments to tap the expertise and funding of the private sector. In this endeavor, the Bank will have
to liaise closely with other international development agencies and the
srivate sector. It is by helping countries keep in mind the vast needs of their
megacities, and develop solutions well snited to their needs, that the Bank
may be of mast assistance to the region’s DMCs.

Economic Development

in DMCs

HIS CHAPTER discusses the recent trends in economic performance

1 the Bank's developing member countries (DMCs). As a background
to the discussion, the next section briefly notes the developments in the
global economy. In the following sections, the performances of individuai DMCs are assessed under the following broad subregions: newly
industrializing economies (NIEs}, the People’s Republic of China and
Mongolia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central Asian republics, and the
Pacific DMCs. Under each subregion, the discussion covers growth performance, inflationary trends, developments in the external sector, and
major changes in domestic policies. The concluding section projects the
economic outlook for each DMC.

Global Economy

The world economic scenario has been generally encouraging over
the last few years. Since 1993, the global economy has been on a recovery
path, ond in 1996 the global growth rate was estimated at about 2.7%. At
the same time, the average global inflation rare moderated somewhat. In
the incustrial economies in 1996, the average inflation rate is estimated to
have heen 2.3%, and in the developing economies, 16%. Economic growth
was fairly widespread across countries in 1996. In many developing economies,
which nad experienced sluggish growth in the past, and in several transition
economies, reforms and structural adjustment programs are beginning to
have a positive impact on theit economic performance. The gross domestic
product (GDP) growth rates in these countries have improved. Some of the
European industrial economies are continuing to experience high rates of
unemployment, and achieving a fiscal balance is a major challenge.
Alter two years of robust expansion, growth of world trade decelerated
in the lattet part of 1995 and early 1996. World trade is estimated to have
increased by 6.7% in 1996, after having grown close to 9% per annum in
the previous two years. The deceleration is due largely to a cyclical decline
in import demand in the United States (US) and Europe, and slower growth
of trade in the Asian economies. Growth of world trade is expected to revive
in 1997 in response to better economic performance in the industrial econoinies and, consequently, as the trade performance of the Asian economies

picks up. According to current forecasts, global economic growth could
accelerate in 1997.

Industrial Economies

Since 1994, the major industrial economies have been in the recovery phase
of the business cycle. The only exception was the Japanese economy which
continued to be sluggish, experiencing less than 1% growth rate in 1994 and
1995. While recovery has been strong in 1996 in the Japanese economy, in

some European economies growth performance was less than anticipated.
The US economy, however, continued co perforin well in 1996. Importantly,
since the major industrial economies are at different stages of their business
cycles, the cumulative upswing in the economic cycle of the Group of Seven
(G7) — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, and US —
remains comparatively weak. The average growth rate of these economies
in 1996 was 2.2%, which is only marginally better chan the 1.9% growth
recorded in 1995.

The US economy is in its sixth year of sustained expansion. While
expansion of the economy was rapid over 1992-1994, growth moderated in
1995. This was in response to the imposition of tighter monetary conditions
due to feats of overheating. In 1996, the US economy grew at a susrainable
rate of 2.3% with relatively low inflation (2.6%). With sustained growth,
the unemployment rate has dropped to 5.4%. Plans have also been drawn
to balance the hudget by early next decade. Growth, however, slowed down
in 1996 in some other important industrial countries such as France, Germany,
and Italy due to a combination of factors such as tight monetary policies
aimed at containing inflation, fiscal contraction, and, in some instances,
structural rigidities, and loss of competitiveness. In Japan, economic growth
accelerated as a result of a succession of fiscal stimulus packages in conjunction with an expansionary monetary policy. A major fiscal stimulus was
provided at the end of 1995, and its impact was manifested in 1996. Better
economic prospects in conjunction with low real interest rates have resulted
in an improved investment climate in Japan. Simultaneously, the depreciation of the yen has contributed to an increase in aggregate demand. The
GDP growth rate in 1996 was 3.3%, and it is forecast to stay at the same
level in 1997. Asa result of the lagged effects of exchange rate realignment,
exports have decelerated while imports have picked up. Lmport demand has
also increased due to a revival of economic acrivity. Both the trade and the
current account surpluses of Japan have, therefore, narrowed.

In sum, the G7 countries are following a medium-term policy stance
of aiming for sustainable growth with low inflation. The majority of these
counties have cautiously guarded against a buildup of inflationary pressures,
and are in the process of reducing their fiscal deficits. Monetary policy has
recently been relaxed in some of these economies to boost economic growth.
The combination of fiscal and monetary measures has successfully contained
inflation, while providing a moderate growth stimulus. However, high unemployment rates in some G7 countries, especially in Europe, continue to
pose s-rious policy challenges. An enduring solution would require introducing structural reforms in some of these countries.

Developing Economies

Despite a marked slowdown in the Latin American region, due to the
Mexican. financial crisis, average real GDP growth rate in all developing
countries was 3.4% in 1995. In 1996, however, the economic growth scenario in the developing countries was mixed. While growth in Latin America
recovered with better performance in Argentina and Mexico, and the growth
momentum in Africa strengthened, the Bank’s DMCs experienced a deceleration in their growth rates. The average aggregate ODP growth rate of
all developing countries in 1996 was 4.1%, somewhat better than that in
the preceding year.

Overview of the Bank's Developing Member Countries

The average growth rate of the Bank’s DMCs has moderated over the last
wo years, from 8.5% in 1994 to 8.2% in 1995, and further to 7.4% in 1996.
The growth slowdown in 1996 is due to a combination of country-specific
features, but the single-most important factor has been the contraction in
external demand and weak export unit values. This has caused a sharp
slowdown in the growth of export receipts of the region. For the broad
subregional groups, average economic growth of the NIEs is estimated to
have declined to 6.3% in 1996. In, particular, the Republic of Korea and
Singapore have been hurt by falling semiconductor prices and weak external
demand for electronic and computer-related goods. In a similar manner,
economic growth in Southeast Asia declined to 7.4% in 1996 from 8.2% in
995. Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand experienced slower growth
asa result of sluggish export performance. On the other hand, the Philippines
registered a steadily improving GDP growth rate in 1996, while the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic (Lao PDR} and Viet Nam continued to experience
robust economic performance. As a consequence of policy measures aimed
at restoring macroeconomic stability, economic growth moderated further but
temaiied strong in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1996. Mongolia’s
growth rare fell in 1996 due to a decline in intemational prices of its main
exports. South Asia’s overall growth performance in 1996 did not change
compored with 1995. Bhutan, India, Maldives, and Sri Lanka recorded
slower growth performance, while Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan expetienced improved economic activity. The three Central Asian economies
(Kazekstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan) are making progress in the
economic restructuring process, and have experienced positive growth rates
after going through severe contraction in the earlier year. The larger econoinies

of the Pacific DMCs accounted for most of the growzh that occurred among
rhese countries in 1996.

Inflationary pressures in DMCs abated further in 1995 and this trend
continued in 1996, reflecting prudent macroeconomic inanagement. On the
external side, the aggregate current account deficit of DMCs deteriorated
substantially in 1996 due to a decline in the export growth rate, The growrh
rate of imports also declined, but was on average higher than that of exports.
The combined current account surplus of the NIEs is estimated to have
declined sharply in 1996. The main contriburing factor was a sharp deterioration in the currenr account deficit of the Republic of Korea from
$8.3 billion in 1995 to an estimated $23.7 billion in 1996. The PRC's current
account surplus improved moderately to about $2 billion. In Sourheast Asia,
the current account deficit is estimated to have widened to $36 billion in
a 1996, from $33.5 billion in 1995, due to increases in the current account
deficits of Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand. In the case of South Asia,
the current account deficit widened somewhat from $9 billion in 1995 to
$12 billion in 1996. The Central Asian republics experienced an improvementin the current account deficit. The external positions of Pacific DMCs
in 1996 showed considerable variation.

Growth in the NIEs slowed down in 1996 due to the global slump in the
demand for electronic and related products. Inflation in the NIEs has eased
slightly, while the consolidated current account surplus has declined sharply
from $11.7 billion in 1995 to a mere $0.6 billion in 1996. Only the Republic
of Korea has a current account deficit, while the other three NIEs have
i908 1996 surpluses. Having achieved virtual full employment, the NIEs are now
concerned with sustaining international competitiveness by modernizing the
capital stock, increasing productivity of labor, and keeping wage increases
in line with growth in productivity. These counrries are investing in more
sophisticated and technologically advanced industries. Traditional laborintensive industries are being progressively shifted to lower-wage locations
both within and outside Asia.

Hong Kong’s economy grew at a moderate pace in 1996 with a GDP growth
of 4.7%, the same growth rate achieved last year. Rising equity and property
markets helped to restore consumer confidence, while infrastructure investment
remained strong. The successful implementation of stabilization measures, which
104% have improved the PRC's medium-renn growth prospects, also provided support
to Hong Kong's economy. Growth of the labor force accelerated in 1996 by
3.1%. However, with employmenr expanding more rapidly by 3.5%, the unemployment rate continued to decline to about 2.6%, down from 3.6% in late
1995. Hong Kong’s economy appears to be on a cyclical recovery, and is

the yen. In contrast, the economy slowed down perceptibly in 1996. os
Hampered by slowing exports due to slack in demand, falling prices of 4
semiconductors, and sluggish capital investments, GDP growth in (996
was estimared at 7%. The slowdown was led by a cyclical contraction
and a marked deceleration in export growth. All the major sectors
registered lower growth in 1996, except for services which improved its
performance from 7.7% in 1995 to 8% in 1996. Agriculture sector growth
declined from 2.8% in 1995 to 1% in 1996, and industrial production
from 10.3% to 7.7%. Private consumption growth also decelerated from
7.9% in 1995 to 6.7% in 1996 due largely to sluggish spending on
nondurable goods and services. At the same time, there was a sharp
reduction in investment growth in 1996, due to uncertain export prospects
of heavy and chemical industries. Construction investment, too, suffered
a slowdown, owing to a slump in building construction. As an outcome
of slower economic growth, employment growth slowed down from 2.7% in
1995 to 1.9% in 1996. The unemployment rate remained low at about 2%.
Singapore’s economy performed better than expected in 1995, boosted
by strong global demand for electronic products and high economic
growth in neighboring economies. Low inflation, high productivity growth
in most sectors, and further liberalization of the labor market contributed
to the rapid growth of 8.8% in 1995. In 1996, economic growth slowed
down to 7% with the deceleration in growth rate affecting all sectors.
The industry sector led the decline with a growth rate of a mere 6.5%,
compared with 9.5% in the earlier year, reflecting the slump in the
global demand for electronic and computer-related goods. The financial
and business services sectors also experienced a deceleration in the
growth rate to 7.2% in 1996, compared with 8.3% in 1995, reflecting
subdued activity in the stock market despite the buoyant performance
of the domestic banking sector. Exports were also adversely affected by
an appreciation of the Singapore dollar, in addition to a slowdown in
external demand. The only sector which experienced acceleration in
growth was construction, expanding by 18% in 1996, compared with
8.4% in 1995. Despite a boom in construction; investment activity remained
weak, dragged down by relatively low levels of equipment investment.
Taipei,China experienced economic growth in 1995 of 6%, reflecting
difficulties faced by the financial sector and the property market. Growth
moderated in 1996 to 5.7% because of a weakening in the demand fot export
markets of electronic products, and damage caused by typhoons. Agriculture
sector growth declined sharply from 2.6% in 1995 to 0.1% in 1996, while
the industry sector posted much weaker growth in 1996 of 3.9%, compared
with 5.7% in 1995. Construction activity was also subdued. The services

sector, which accounts for about 60% of GDP, continued to perform well
with a growth rate of 7.2%. Although the unemployment rate is low by
international standards, it increased to nearly 2.5% in 1996 from 1.8% in
the previous year, prompting the Government to freeze immigration of
foreign labor, and launch new job-training schemes.

Inflation

Hong Kong's inflation rate in 1996 averaged 6%, well below the 1995 level
of 8.7%. The major reasons for the decline in the inflation rate were the
effective appreciation of the Hong Kong dollar due to its link with the
US dollar, and the strengthening of the latter vis-a-vis major currencies
in 1996, lower increases of house rents, lower wage increases, and lower
prices on some key commodities. The monetary policy also remained
tight for a good part of the year. With the linked exchange rate system
and continued tight monetary policy, inflation is expected to continue
its downward trend in 1997,

The Republic of Korea’s consumer price index (CPI) as of end-1996
tose by 4.5%,’ despite declining economic growth. Prices of agriculture
secror products and services, especially public utility prices, were higher in
1996, compared with the earlier year. Wages are estimated to have increased
by 12% in 1996. However, a potentially serious problem is the demand of
workers for higher real wage increases. Resistance to wage increases in excess
of increase in productivity, and efforts to align labor laws with Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) standards caused serious
labor unrest. Unless labor problems can he amicably resolved, the economy
will continue to suffer loss of output, inflationary pressures, and reduced
competitiveness.

Singapore’s CPI rose by 1.4% in 1996. Inflationaty pressures remained
moderate due to a strong domestic currency; high savings rate, well in excess
of domestic investment demand; the softening of the demand in the property market; and a general moderation in economic activity, which kept
wage increases in check. Inflationary pressures were also eased by a tight
monetary policy and a prudent fiscal stance.

In Taipei,China, prices increased at a moderate rate in 1996. Owing
to a decline in the world prices of raw materials, both import prices and
wholesale prices fell, compared with 1995. In addition, the slower increases
in the prices of services and residential rent, as well as restrained wage
trends, also helped to hold down upward price movements. As a result,
consumer prices, excluding food, rose by only 2.78%. However, food
ptices rose sharply during the second half of the year, following che
damage caused by a major typhoon. Consumer prices rose by 3.07% for
the year as a whole.

External Sector
Hong Kong’s weaker export performance in 1996 reflecred the strengthening

of the US dollar, to which the Hong Kong dollar is pegged, and a weak
demand for imports in most European economies. Overall, domestic exports

ell in 1996 by about 8%, compared with 1995 levels, while reexports
increased by 7%. Total merchandise exports rose in 1996 by 4%, considerably
lower than the 14.8% growth in 1995. Because imports grew even more
slowly {estimated ar 3% in 1996), and the terms of trade improved in favor
of Hong Kong, the visible trade account improved somewhat.

The Republic of Korea suffered serious deterioration in its balance of
payments in 1996, The export growth rate dropped sharply to about 4.1%
in 1996, compared with 31.5% in 1995, due to a drop in the international
price of semiconductors and weak external demand for electronics,
computer peripherals, automobiles, textiles, and chemicals. The export
performance was also affected by depreciation of the Japanese yen vis-a-vis
the US dollar, which eroded the relative competitiveness of Korean exports.
n addition, the real effective exchange rate of the won appreciated by 8%,
urtther weakening the price competitiveness of exports. Import growth also
deceterated in 1996 to 12.2%, compared with a 32% increase in 1995.
However, consumer goods imports continued to surge and are estimated to
have increased by about 21% in 1996. With imports growing faster than
expotts, the trade deficit widened in 1996 to $15.3 billion from $4.7 billion
in 1995. The current account deficit is estimated to have further deteriorated
to about $23.7 billion.

Growth of Singapore’s exports dropped to abour 6.7% in 1996, down
from 21.5% in 1995. The decline was due to a weaker global demand for
elecrronic and computer-related goods, which account for about 26.5% of
total exports. As the global oversupply of electronic proclucrs persisted
throughout the year, with prices remaining weak, the overall export performance remained well below the economy’s potential. However, given the
openness of Singapore’s economy, and the import dependence of exports,
slower growth of exports was matched by slower growth of imports, which
grew by a mere 6%. Nevertheless, the trade balance shifted from a surplus
of $1.6 billion in 1995 to a deficit of $0.6 billion in 1996. Despite the
deterioration in the trace deficit, the current account surplus remained
healthy at an estimated $14.2 billion, representing 15.3% of the country’s
gross national product (GNP).

Trade acrivity in Tatpei,China decelerated sharply in 1996 with merchandise exports growing by 8.2% (compared with 20% in 1995), and
imports by 2% (compared with 21% in 1995). The sharp reduction in exports
of electronic and computer-related products was largely responsible for the
lower export growth. The sluggish growth of imports was due to a slowdown
of domestic investment, as well as the depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar.
Because impotts grew much slower than exports, rhe trade balance improved
markedly. The current account surplus more than doubled to $10 billion,
representing 3.7% of GNP in 1996, up from 1.8% of GNP in 1995.

 

 

Domestic Policies

Hong Kong’s high inflation is a cause for concern. However, the increase
in prices of tradable goods has been consistently lower than that of nontradables.
To address the issue of high inflation and to be able to maintain the
economy's comperitiveness, the Government has taken steps to reduce supplyside constrainrs and to continue on irs path of fiscal conservatism.

The Republic of Korea’s entry into OECD has brought about a number
of policy changes. In 1996, companies dealing in securities were allowed to
move into the trust business, and the reserve requirements on bank deposits
were reduced. Overseas borrowing restrictions have been diluted, and the
ownership limit of individual foreign investors has been increased. Effective
October 1996, the foreign ownership ceiling on Korean shares was increased
from 18% to 20%. The Government has also legislated to bring labor laws
in line with OECD norms. The country experienced widespread labor unrest
coward the end of 1996, The Government is also encouraging the participation of women in rrade and industry.

Since Singapore’s economic slowdown in 1996 was due primarily to a
cyclical downturn in the demand for electronic and computer-related ptoducts, no significant fiscal stimulus was considered necessary to restore economic growth. However, to reduce the vulnerability of the economy on
account of concenrration of exports in electronics and heavy chemicals, the
Government has identified a number of “industrial clusters” that ir wishes
to promote under its “Manufacturing 2000” Program. These include petrochemicals, precision engineering, and chemicals.

Taipei,China is fast maturing into an industrial economy in which the
industry sector is undergoing major restructuring. Light and labor-intensive
industries are giving way to capital-intensive and high-technology industries. Promoting such industries so that they can compete internationally
is a continuing challenge to the Government. The Government has launched
the Asia-Pacific Regional Operations Center, which is aimed at promoting
closer economic links between Taipei,China and the neighboring economies.

People’s Republic of China and Mongolia

The economy of the PRC grew at double-digit rates during 1992-1995.
Widespread structural reforms were introduced during this period, and the
economy was gradually opened up to the outside world. As a consequence,
the PRC experienced rapid growth of foreign trade, and has also attracted
large amounts of foreign direct investment. To prevent overheating and to
stabilize the economy, the Government has been followmg tight monetary
and fiscal policies since mid-1993. This helped the economy to achieve a
"soft landing." Policies aimed at structural reforms and stabilizacion have
had positive effects on the trade and current account balances, exchange
rate stability, domestic resource mobilization, and in moderating inflationary
pressures.

Mongolia made significant progress during 1990-1994 in implementing
structuralpolicy reforms. As a result, after four years of negative growth and
high inflation, the economy began to recover in 1994 and 1995, when
significant positive growth was recorded. The recovery was more fragile in
1996 due to declining export unit values, a decline in tourism receipts, and
problems in the banking sector.

Economic Growth
The PRC's GDP growth in 1996 is estimated at 9.7%, which was somewhat

lower than the 10.2% growth registered in 1995. In terms of sectors, agriculture sector output grew by 5.1% in 1996, compared with 4.5% in 1995.ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN DMCs

The agriculture sector remained buoyant due to an increased rate of public
investment, good climatic conditions, and the upward adjustment of procurement prices introduced in mid-1994, which improved incentives to
farmers. Industrial output growth remained strong at 12.3% in 1996. However,
compared with 1995, growth was slower because the ourput of state-owned
enterprises was constrained by the tight credit policy. Fixed-asset investment growth was also moderated in 1996. The official urhan unemployment
rate remained relatively low at 3% in 1996. However, taking into account
the estimated 40 million workers, including redundant workers in stateowned enterprises, and about 120 million migrant workers who may or may
not be fully employed in the formal sector, the unemployment rate could
be higher. Progress in dealing with inefficiencies in state-owned enterprises
has been slow.

Mongolia's economy grew by 2.6% in 1996, compared with 6.3% in
1995. The slower growth is due to a fall in the inrernational prices of its
major exports (e.g., copper and cashmere), disruptions in power supplies,
financial and liquidity problems in the banking sector, and a fall in tourism
revenue. The emerging private sector provided the main impetus for growth
in 1996. Private sector growth has been strong in tourism-related services,
retail trade, and the livestock sector.

Inflation

Inflation in the PRC fell sharply in 1996 as a result of the Government’s
policy measures. The national retail price index (RPI) dropped to 6.1%, well
below the 21.7% growth at the end of (994 and 14.8% ar the end of 1995.
The broader CPI, which includes services as well as retail goods, was slightly
higher ar 8.3%. The relatively low inflation rate in the PRC can be artributed
to several factors. Among the major reasons are tight monetary policy,
bumper harvests in agriculture, and development of new market-oriented
macroeconomic management measures. Inflation was also checked by policies
aimed at specifically neutralizing the expansionary monetary impact of rapid
accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. In addition, low rates of globa
inflation also moderated the price increase in rhe PRC.

The average rate of inflation in Mongolia in 1996 was estimated at
57.5%. Continuing high inflation reflects rising import prices as a result o}
a 45% depreciation in the exchange rate. A substantial increase in power

and heating tariffs also contributed to an increase in price levels in 1996.”

 

The one-time adjustment in the utility tariffs and emerging prices wil
eventually reduce the pressure of subsidies on the budget, and contribute
to a reduction in inflation in 1997. r

External Sector

The PRC’s foreign trade picture deteriorated in 1996. Exports grew by a
mere 1.5% ro $130 billion, compared with 24.9% the previous year. Imports
grew by 5.1% in 1996 co $116 billion, compared with 15.5% the previous
year. The slower growth of exports was due to the discontinuation of valueadded tax rebates to exporters, and to the stricter enforcement of copyright
and patent laws by the Government. Despite the slowdown of exports, the
PRC increased irs global market share in garments, textiles, and ligbt machinery.

from $489 million in 1995. The trade deficit was about $87 million and the

current account deficit was 8.7% of GDP. The major reason underlying the

deterioration in the external accounts in 1996 was a 30% drop in interna
tional copper prices and a 10% decline in cashmere prices, which led to a
1992 1903 15 joes 1996 significant decline in the country's terms of trade.

Domestic Policies

The PRC, according to the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), will have
transformed itself into a socialist market economy by the end of the Plan
period. This goal is to be achieved by adopting market-oriented reforms,
poverty-reduction schemes, opening the economy further to the outside
world, and strategies for environmentally sustainable growth. The Government
has placed priority in achieving an appropriate balance between reforms and
development, and social stability. Encouraged by success in bringing inflation
under control, the Government reduced lending and deposit rates on two
occasions during 1996. Credit easing reflected the growing confidence of the
Government as an indirect tool of monetary management, and is expected
to improve the performance of state-owned enterprises. The yuan was made
convertible on the current account in 1996, four years ahead of schedule.
This should provide further incentives to increase foreign trade.

In Mongolia, the new Government, which took office in the middle
of 1996, is committed to implementing wide-ranging reforms designed to
accelerate Mongolia’s transition to a market-based, export-oriented economy.
Despite difficult economic conditions, the Government implemented some
bold policy measures which included raising energy prices and closing of
unviable commercial banks.

Southeast Asia?

Although there is diversity in living standards and level ofdevelopment, the
Southeast Asian countries share a number of common features, such as
prudent macroeconomic management, high savings rares, high investment
rates, and sustained rapid economic growth. Malaysia and Thailand have
the highest per capita income levels, having grown rapidly over the past
decade. The two countries have also been recipients of sizable inflows of

3 Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, amd Viet Nam. fo

foreign direct investment, which has helped them to rapidly add industrial
capacity and adopt new technology. While unemployment is not a problem
in either country, both are faced with the challenge of upgrading their
industrial base toward producing more capital- and skill-intensive product
fines. Critical to this challenge is also rhe need to improve tbe capacity of
human resources. Indonesia, because of its much larger population and
sizable oil and natural gas reserves, is in a somewhat different category than
its neighbors. However, it shares a number of features, including a high
savings tate, a rapidly growing industry sector, and large inflows of foreign
direct investment. The Philippines has surmounted a number of difficulties
and seems poised to join the other countries of the region in shifting to a
bigh-growth mode. However, to sustain the pace of economic momentura,
the country still has to boost its relatively low savings rate, and overcome
the deficiencies of infrastructure. Finally, rhe Southeast Asian economies
in transition —Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam — are all
making progress by moving toward a market-based system at varying paces.
Cambodia continues to make good progress in implementing reforms. The
Lao PDR has established the basic elements of a market-oriented system.
Further reforms, particularly to increase domestic resource mobilization, and
basic development activities, such as further monerization of the economy,
remain the challenges of the future. Myanmar is making an attempt to shift
toward a market-based economy, although it has a long way to go before
the process is completed. Viet Nam is just beginning the industrialization
process, and is focused on import substitution with some export orientation
in labor-intensive manufacturing. While adopting market-oriented policies
in many areas, it still maintains a strong central planning apparatus. The
Government has liberalized most prices, continued reforins in fiscal policy,
rationalized the public enterprise sector, and instituted improvements in rhe
foreign trade regime.

Economic Growth

The Indonesian economy grew rapidly in 1995, driven by strong private
consumption and investment demand. In rhe face of domestic and external
imbalances, overheating was the leading concern of the policymakers. Consumer price inflation was close to 9.4% and the current account deficit more
than doubled to $7.02 billion from the previous year. To deal with these
challenges, the Government adopted a tight monetary policy in 1995. This
slowed import growth in 1996 and moderated consumer price inflation.
Lower domestic demand coincided with weak demand for exports. However,
the implementation of a large number of foreign and domestic investment
projects maintained GDP growth at 7.8% in 1996, only slightly lower than
the 8.2% growth achieved in 1995. Robust foreign direct investment was
the driving force underlying the growth momentum of the economy in 1996.

Malaysia’s high growth rate, stable prices, and healthy fiscal surplus
reflect the effectiveness of sound macroeconomic management. GDP growth,
based on market prices, continued to be robust in 1995 at 9.5%. A key
concern of rhe monetary authorities in Malaysia has been the sharp detetioration in che current account deficit to $7.5 billion in 1995, from $4.1 billion
in 1994. As a result, monetary policy has been kept tight since the middle
of 1995, raising interest rates and increasing bank reserve requirements. The

economy’s growth rate moderated in 1996 to 8.2%. Apart from governmentinduced policy measures to restrain domestic demand, GDP growth in 1996
was also adversely affecred by a slowdown in the growth of exports. As
electronic products account for over 30% of exports and 18.5% of manufacturing, the economy is vulnerable to the continuing slump in the global
electronic market.

The Philippine economy is gradually moving to a higher growth path,
having recovered from rhe severe recession in the eatly 1990s. The recovery
further strengthened in 1995, with GDP growing steadily at 4.8%. The
restoration of political stability and the successful implementation of economic
reforms have led to the recovery. The average inflation rate remained
steady, while the current account deficit widened. Economic growth was
strong in 1996, with GNP expanding by about 6.8% and GDP by 5.5%. The
difference between growth rate of GDP and GNP is the net factor income
from abroad, which are largely workers’ remittances. Economic growth was
driven primarily by a construction boom and strong growth in the agricul
ture and services sectors. The agriculture sector grew by 3.1%, up from 0.8%
growth in 1995, while the services sector grew by 6% in 1996, compared
with 5% in 1995. The overall steady growth is attributed to political stability
and economic reforms — public sector monopolies are in the proccss of being
dismantled, while the basic industries are being opened to foreign competition. Containing the inflationary pressures and softening of the inrerest
rate would further strengthen the foundations for sustaining growth over the
medium term.

 

Thailand’s economic growth has been remarkable over the past decade,
at an average rate of [0%, with low inflation below 5%. Growth was buoyed
by strong domestic demand, rapid expansion in expotts, and a surge in the
inflow of foreign direct investment. The economy’s rate of growth slowed
down perceptibly in 1996 to about 6.7%. The major causes of the decline
in growth performance are tight monetary policy, falling exports, and political uncertainty, which prevailed in the run-up to the general elections.
The agriculture sector grew in 1996 by 3.1%, virtually the same growth rate
as in 1995. The industry sector experienced a sharp deceleration in the
gtowth rate to 8.2%, compared with a growth of 11.4% in 1995, and the
services sector grew hy 6.1%, compared with 7.6% in 1995. Thailand also
recorded a fiscal surplus equivalent to 0.9% of GDP in 1996.

Cambodia's GDP growth rate slowed down to about 6% in 1996,
compared with 7.6% in 1995. The agriculture sector failed to sustain its
remarkable performance of the previous year, and recorded a growth rate
of only 1.5%. This was due mainly to floods which destroyed large areas of
rice fields throughout the country. The industry sector continued to perform
well, registering a growth rate of 13.5% in 1996. The services sector is
estimated to have grown by 7.7%.

In the Lao PDR, economic growth accelerated to 7.2% in 1996, substantially above the average GDP growth of 6.4% during 1991-1995, Agriculture, which still accounts for more tban half of GDP, was affected by
floods but managed to grow by abour 3% in 1996. Industry expanded by
13.4%, and the services sector by 10.4%. The low level of domestic saving
is constraining investment by the private sector, which lacks access to

annum. Also, the 1996-2000 public investment plan allocates an increasingECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN DMCs

share of expenditure to education, health, and social development to enhance the productive capacity of human resources.

Myanmar’s GDP is estimated to have grown by 6% in 1996, compared
with a growth rate of 7.7% in 1995, Agriculrure, the largest sector of the
economy, grew by 5.4%, mining by about 13%, manufacturing by 10%, and
construction by 4.5%. The financial sector registered a healthy growth rate
of 14.6%.

Viet Nam experienced continued rapid growth in 1996, due in part
to the considerable progress made in economic liberalization. The upsurge
in economic activity, however, has been accompanied by increased inflationary pressures and deteriorating current account deficits. Economic growth
was robust at 9.5% in 1996. Growth was led by strong performance of the
industry sector, which expanded by 13.3% in 1996. The sector now conwibutes over 30% of GDP. High industrial growth is, to a large extenr, the
result of strong foreign direct investment flows,

Inflation

Inflation in Indonesia slowed down due to the Central Bank's continued
tight monetary stance, which has moderated the pace of private consumption
growth. The increased stock of grains and improved food distribution channels have provided added protection against weather-induced price increases. Food prices are estimated to have fallen in 1996, while housing,
textiles, and services costs were higher. The overall mflation rate in 1996
dropped to about 8%, compared with 9.4% in 1995. Falling inflation has
allowed an easing of the interest tates.

Malaysia’s monetary policy remained tight throughout 1996 asa means
to check the buildup of inflationary pressures, and to contain the deficit of
the current account of the balance of payments. The moderarion of domestic demand and rhe slowdown in export growth reduced the pressures for
overheating. Inflation was, therefore, low at 3.5% in 1996, although it was
marginally higher than the 3.4% experienced in 1995.

Consumer price inflation in the Philippines has been falling steadily
since March 1996, partly due to the easing of agricultural supplies, and
partly due to the tightening of monetary policy. Stable food prices and
prudent management of capital inflows further contributed to keeping
inflation in check. For the yeat as a whole, the inflation rate averaged
about 8.4%.

Consumer price inflation in Thailand was estimated at 5.9% in 1996,
compared with 5.8% in 1995. The inflation rate was contained at a relatively low level due to both supply-side factors, such as higher production
of rice and processed food, and subdued demand because of a slack in the
economy. A strong baht also contributed to sofrening the rate of inflation.

Cambodia's inflation rate has been steadily rising over the last few
years. In 1996, the inflation rate increased ro about 10% as a result of the
production shortfall in crops caused by heavy floods, particularly in the
latter part of the year.

In the Lao PDR, the Government is trying to keep a tight money
supply, restricting annual money supply growth to about 20%. Measures
taken to contain inflation were largely successful, as the Vientiane CPI,
which is used as a proxy for inflation in the country, decelerated to 14%

in 1996 from 19.4% in 1995, led largely by higher food prices early in
the year caused by flood-induced shortages of rice and other foodstuff.

Inflation in Myanmar is officially estimated at around 22%, although
it could be higber given the limited coverage and time lags in releasing the
official figures.

Viet Nam’s inflation has declined after two consecutive years of doubledigit inflation. The key factors behind this downward trend have been tight
monetary policy, good rice harvest, and better food distribution. The Government
has demonstrated fiscal prudence and restraint in monetary policy. In light of
experience last year, the authorities have carried out advance stockpiling of key
items such as cement and rice. Inflation is estimared to have been 6% in 1996.
Although consumer price inflation has fallen sharply this year, the threat of
higher inflation in the medium term remains. Rapid economic growth, strong
capital inflows, and rising per capita incomes, combined with persistent infrastructure bottlenecks and imminent shortages of construction materials,
have the potential to push prices upwards.

External Sector

Indonesia’s export performance in 1996, especially of non-oil manufactures,
was considerably below Government expecrations. Relatively low exposure
of Indonesia to electronic exports (less than 5% of non-oil exports) has,
however, insulated the country from the sharp slowdown in exports witnessed in the neighboring countries, which are heavily dependent on electronic exports. Simultaneously, firmer oil prices have had a favorable effect on
the country’s export receipts. Moderate economic activity also kept import
growth in check, Merchandise exports grew by an estimated 8.8% in 1996
(compared with 13.1% in 1995), while merchandise imports grew by about
11.8% (compared with 23% in 1995). The trade surplus was estimated at
$5.1 billion in (996. However, the large cleficit on the invisibles account
balanced out the surplus, leaving a current account deficit of $8.9 billion
in 1996, compared with a deficit of about $7 billion in the previous year.

Malaysia’s merchandise export growth decelerated sharply in 1996 to
4%, compared with a growth of 25.9% in the previous year. Import growth
in 1996 was even lower at 1.3%. Consequently, the trade balance was in
surplus of about $1.8 billion. However, due to a large deficit in the invisibles
account, rhe current account deficit was about $5.9 billion.

The Philippines’ merchandise exports in 1996 grew by 17.5%, while
imports expanded at an even higher rate of 25%. While export performance
was strong, it was lower than the 29.4% growth recorded in 1995. The rapid
expansion in imports was due mainly to a surge in capital and intermediate
goods imports, which should enhance the productive capacity and the
competitiveness of the economy. As a result of substantially divergent rates of
growth of exports and imports, the trade deficit widened to about $12 billion
in 1996. With a surplus in the services account, due largely to workers’ remittances, the current account deficit was estimated at $3.5 billion. The currenr
account deficit was more than offset by a surplus on the capiral account.
Continued capital inflows, both private and official, have enabled foreign
exchange reserves to incvease to $13.3 billion by end-December 1996.

Thailand's total exports declined in 1996, compared with a 24.7%
growth in 1995. This slump is attributable partly to the worldwide downturnECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN DMCs

SES TS SE es eS Say

in the demand for electronic products but, more importantly, to the
decline in the competitiveness of traditional labor-intensive manufactied exports, such as textiles, garments, and shoes. Stagnation in exports
negated any likely benefit from a sharp decline in the growth of imports
from 31.6% in 1995 to a mere 4.1% in 1996. This brought ahout a sharp
deterioration in the current account deficit to about $14.5 billion (8.4%
of the GDP), which is a source of concern to the country’s policymakers.
he recent sluggishness in Thai exports suggests that the strength of the
baht, together with rising domestic wages, may be taking a heavy toll. Unless
the economy can make expeditious progress in moving up the value-added
ladder in exports through improvements in skills formation, export growth
may continue to be constrained and the current account deficit may not
ease in the short run. International reserves are, however, at a comfortable
level, providing somewhat more than six months of import cover.

Cambodia’s domestic exports are estimated to have declined by about
28.1% in 1996 as a consequence of the log export ban introduced in 1995,
I.aports are also estimated to have declined by 14.9% in 1996, compared
with the previous year. The trade deficit was about $400 million and the
current account deficit was estimated at $430 million (14.1% of GNP).

The Lao PDR’s exports in 1996 are estimated to have declined by
9.5%, while imports grew by 15.1%. Exports are concentrated in a few
products such as electricity, logs and timber, and garmenrs. Likewise, imports are concentrated in construction, electrical goods, and machinery and
equipment. In 1996, there was a sharp decline in manufactured goods with
garinent exports falling by 15% with the loss of Generalized System of
Preferences access in the leading markets. Simultaneously, imports of investment goods also increased because of higher investment in hydropower
projects during the year. Trade deficit in 1996 was estimated at $363 million
and the current account deficit at $308 million.

Myanmar’s exports are estimated to have grown by about 9% in 1996,
while imports increased by about 6%. Although the trade deficit widened
during the year, a growing share of imports is accounted for by capital goods
which directly affect the production capacity of the economy.

Viet Nam’s trade deficit deteriorated to $3.4 billion in 1996, compared
with a deficit of $2.3 billion in 1995. Export growth in 1996 was, however,
healthy at 30.4%, but imports expanded at an even higher rate of 35.2%.
The current account deficit in 1996 was estimated at $2.9 billion, compared
with a deficit of $2 billion in 1995.

Domestic Policies
i

‘The Indonesian authorities introduced a series of deregulation measures in
1996 aimed at improving the performance of non-oil exports and narrowing
the growing current account deficit. Tariff rates were lowered, the valueadded tax on the shipping industry was abolished to bring down transportation costs, private enterprises were permitted to esrablish bonded zones
exempt from value-added tax, and the restriction on 100% foreign ownership was lifted in commodities such as trading, mining, and forestry. Bank
Indonesia followed a restrictive credit policy aimed at curbing overheating
of the economy. Greater exchange rate flexibility was introduced with the
widening of the intervention band of the rupiah in September 1996 from

67ANNUAL REPORT 1996

3% to 8%. Using privatization proceeds and budget surplus, the Government
prepaid high-cost external debe.

Malaysia addtessed its current account deficit by significantly tightening the monetary policy, maintaining a surplus in the Federal Government's
budget, and introducing a range of measures to promote services sector
exports. Simultaneously, the Government continued its measures to liberalize the banking and financial services. The Government also announced
that it would make regular issues of zero-coupon bonds to provide a benchmark yield curve for developing the privare sector bond market. The Seventh
Malaysia Plan (1996-2000), approved in May 1996, reoriented the investment-driven growth strategy toward greater reliance on productivity improvements. The emphasis on private sector-led growth, successfully pursued
during the Sixth Plan period, will continue with further privatization of
government services and infrastructure. In line with Malaysia's strong budgetary position and high level of domestic saving, only a limited role is
anticipated for foreign borrowing. The 1997 Budget, announced in October
1996, continued the stance of fiscal conservatism. Rapid economic growth
and a widening tax base have resulted in rapid expansion of revenues and
a sharp increase in the budget surplus. This has enabled the Government
to finance most of its development expenditure from its own resources as
well as to prepay its more expensive foreign loans. This was achieved despite
a gradual reduction in tax rates in the previous three budgets.

The Philippine economy is set for sustained growth. Recent structural
reforms have significantly reduced the macroeconomic distortions, the public
sector and the fiscal imbalances have been reduced, and the Central Bank
restructuring has restored confidence in the banking system. The opening
up of the telecommunications and the banking sectors, and the deregulation
of the domestic oil industry should attract larger investments in rhese
sectors. The growth in GNP is likely to be driven by continued growth in
exports and investment on the demand side, and by growth of total factor
productivity on the supply side.

Thailand is in the process of gradually implementing changes in its
commercial policy as part of the mandate under the World Trade Organization.
In 1995, the Government restructured customs tariffs on 20 product categories covering 6,898 tariff lines. Average tariff rates will be reduced to
17% by 1997, with a reduction in the number of rates from 39 to 6. In
March 1996, the Cabinet endorsed the Eighth Economic and Social
Development Plan 1997~2001. The Plan calls for a continuing emphasis on,
human development, social sector development, regional and local development, and on improvement in the quality of life and natural resource
managemenr and preservation. A corresponding budger was approved for
fiscal year (FY) 19974 in late August 19964; rhe FY1997 budget of 984 billion
baht is equivalent to over 18% of GDP. While the Bank of Thailand is
committed to slowing the growth of domestic credit, in the first half of 1996
it sought to increase liquidity somewhat. In accordance with the five-year
financial sector master plan, the Bank of Thailand began issuing new licenses to foreign banks in August 1996. The key for long-term macroeconomic stability is to promote domestic saving to reduce the current
account deficit. New measures to address the level and growth of domesric

saving include selective use of tax incentives to encourage long-term contractual saving; liberalization of the life insurance inclustry; and restructuring of personal and corporate income taxes to encourage saving and investment.

Cambodia faces important challenges if the pace of high growth is to
be sustained. The most important of rhese is the country’s low rare of saving.
Folicies need to be put in place to mobilize both private and public saving.
The former requires the rapid development of a reliable financial sector, which
can attract savings at a positive real interest rate, particularly from rural areas
which still support rhe bulk of the population. Steps in this direction are being
gradually introduced. The latter requires a buoyant revenue system and careful
public expenditure management, for which fiscal reforms are being phased
in under rhe Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).

In October 1996, the Lao PDR Government adopted a socioeconomic
development plan for 1996-2000, which identifies priorities in food production, commercialization of enterprises, human development, infrastructure,
and promotion of the services sector. However, the weakness of the foreign
exchange system could pose a threat to macroeconomic stability. The economy
faces acute shortage of foreign exchange, which is likely to persist till new
export industries develop and the country is able to generate substantial
foreign exchange revenues from its hydropower projects.

Myanmnar’s success in the coming years and the long-term sustainability
of its economic prowth depend crucially on two related factors: the implementation of the market reform program, and the achievemenr of
macroeconomic stability. The process of gradual transformation from a
centrally planned economy to a market-oriented economy, started in the
late 1980s, already includes the removal of government control from the
agriculture sector; the opening up of foreign trade, including border trade,
to the private sector; an open-door policy for foreign direct investment; and
permission for private financial institutions to operate. The system of forced
government procurement of major crops has been largely abolished, and the
domestic marketing and processing of crops have been liberalized. In the
industry sector, all subsectors have been opened up to the private sector,
except oil and gas exttaction, and the mining of gems. Further issues requiring attention are the lack of adequate physical infrastructure, especially
power, water, and telecommunicarions services.

Viet Nam is currently making rapid progress in structural reforms, and
restoring macroeconomic stability under the ESAF arrangemenc with the
international Monetary Fund (IMF). From a medium-term perspective, the
country is also in the ptocess of implementing reforms in the legal system;
lad policy, especially simplifying and rationalizing the regulations on land
use rights; state enterprises, especially by making rhem commercially. viable;
tural infrastructure; existing power plants and distribution systems; the
system of financing education and better targeting of spending on health;
and the system of social safety nets.

to supplement the domestic savings effort. South Asia’s economic performance in 1996 was at an aggregate level similar to that in 1995. Bhutan,
India, Maldives, and Sri Lanka experienced a slowdown in their growth
rates. Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan continued to make good economic
progress. While most South Asian economies have been undertaking policies aimed at promoting structural efficiency and macroeconomic stabilization, they have a long way to go before the policy regimes match those of
Southeast Asian economies. Rapid progress on the policy front is clearly the
key to South Asia’s economic success over the medium to long term, especially since the external environment is likely to remain favorable.

Economic Growth

Bangladesh's GDP growth rate in 19968 accelerated to 4.7% from 4.4% in
1995. The agriculture sector erew by 1.9%, while the industry sector, which
was adversely affected by social unrest during the first quarter of 1996, grew
at a lower rate of 5.7%, compared with 8.4% achieved in 1995. The
Government is targeting GDP growrh of 7% over the next few years. It also
anticipates keeping the overall budget deficit at 5.7% of GDP, and plans
CO pursue appropriate monetary management to keep inflation in check.

Bhutan’s economic development has been generally favorable in 1996.
The commissioning of the ferro-alloy plant and expansion in the capacity
of the cement industry contributed significantly to bring real GDP growth
to about 6.4% in 1996.

India’s’ economic performance in 1994 and 1995 was commendable,
especially when viewed against the severe economic problems confronted
in the early 1990s. GDP growth® in 1995 was estimated at 7.1%, slowing
down slightly from the 7.2% growth experienced in 1994. The industry

sector has been performing strongly, recording growth

 

 

 

rates of 11.6% in 1995 and 9.4% in 1994, In 1996, the
economy slowed down somewhat, due largely to a
deceleration in the industrial growth rate because of
weak domestic and external demands. Industrial production is estimated to have increased by about 8.7%
in 1996. Similarly, growth in the services sector is
anticipated to decline to 7.4%, compared with 8.8%
in the previous year. Nevertheless, the economy recorded a growth rate of about 6.8% in 1996, aided by
strong agriculture growth following a good monsoon
season which compensated for the deceleration in the
industry and services sectors. A weak fiscal position
remains a major cause of concern in the sustainability
of economic growth over the medium term. Infrastructural constraints, especially power generation, are

This can be explained by capacity constraints in both the tourism and
fisheries sectors.

Nepal's? GDP prew by 6% in 1996, higher than the 3.4% growth
recorded in 1995. The higher growth of the economy is due to the recovery
of the agriculture sector which expanded by 5.4%, a turnaround from the
previous year's contraction of 0.3%. Favorable monscon allowed for higher
production of food grains and cash crops. The manufacturing sector grew
by 4.9%, compared with a growth rate of 2% in 1995 because of the revival
of carpet and garment industries. Similarly, industrial growth increased from
3.2% in 1995 to 5.3% in 1996, while the services sector improved its growth
rate from 6.4% to 7.3%.

Economic growth in Pakistan! improved significantly in 1996 with
GDP expanding by 5.9%, compared with 4.4% in 1995. Growth was led by
the recovery of the agriculture sector which expanded by 6.7% because of
a bumper harvest in cotton, and expansion in output of whear and rice. The
services sector also improved significantly, expanding by 5.9%, compared
with 4.1% in the previous year. The industry sector recovered in 1996,
growing at 6%, compared with 3.6% in 1995, The strong performance of
tbe large-scale industty sector was helped by a significant increase in investment in plant and machinery. Further, the textile industry got a boost
because of the bumper cotton crop. Tbe budget deficit in 1996 is estimated
to be in the range of 5.5% of GDP. Above-average growth rate is estimated
to have created an additional 1 million jobs, 70% of which are in rural areas.

Sri Lanka's economic problems have deepened due to internal problems in conjuncrion with adverse weather conditions. The economy is
estimated to have grown by a mere 3.8% in 1996, a sharp deceleration from
the 5.5% growth recorded in 1995. The drought in early 1996 caused severe
power shortages and crop losses, which have impacted severely on the
economy's performance. Tourist arrivals also dropped by 31% in the first
six months of 1996. Aggregate demand weakened considerably as inflation
eroded disposable incomes.

Inflation

The inflation rate in Bangladesh is estimated to have been contained at
4% in 1996 due to a drop in rice prices in April 1996 following a good
harvest. In recent years, the monetary policy has been generally expansionary
with a sharp increase in credit to the private sector. Steps are being taken
to strengthen the financial system so that monetary policy can become a
potent tool for macroeconomic management.

Inflation in Bhutan is estimated at 9% in 1996, which is closely relared
to inflation in India due to the fixed parity of the local currency, the
ngultrum, to the Indian rupee.

India’s end of period consumer price index moderated in 1995 to 8.9%
(compared with 8.1% in 1994), due partly to a tight monetary policy, and
partly to postponement of the adjustment of administrative prices of
commodities in the earlier part of tbe year. In July 1996, petroleum prices

were increased by an average of 18% while, earlier in the year, procurement
prices and minimam support prices of various agricultural commodities were
raised by 5—10%. The monetary policy has also been relaxed in recent
months. While these factors are likely to push up prices, weak domestic
demand has, however, kept inflationary pressures in check. The annual rate
of inflation was low at 4.7% in the first quarter of 1996, but had increased
to 8.7% by December 1996. Inflationary pressures escalated as welfarespending commitments and the subsequent need to increase revenues put
pressure on prices; inflation for the year was estimared at 8.9%.

Inflation in the Maldives was contained by tight monetary policy in
conjunction with better performance of the economy. Inflation was at 3.5%
in 1996, compared with 5.4% in 1995.

Nepal’s CPI increased by 8.1% in 1996, compared with 7.6% in 1995.
Escalation of prices of food and heverages, as well as petroleum producrs,
conttibuted significantly to the inflationary pressures. The depreciation of
the Nepalese rupee by about 11% exerted added pressure on prices.

Pakistan in 1996 continued to pursue monetary policy aimed at ¢conomic stabilization by conraining credit expansion. As a consequence of a
tight monetary policy, in conjunction with a good harvest, inflationary
pressures were relatively subdued. Inflarion is estimated at about 10.8% in
1996, lowet than the 13% in 1995.

Consumer price inflation in Sri Lanka escalated in 1996 because
of production failure due te internal problems, drought, and the adoption
of measures to remove food subsidies. Additional pressure came’ from
an increasing fiscal deficit. Due to an increase in government expenditure,
povernment finances came under ptessure. The Government had to remove
subsidies to contain the budget overrun. Consumer price inflarion was
estimated ar an annual rate of 15.9% in [996.

External Sector

Bangladesh has introduced substantive trade policy reforms over the last
few years, which have reduced and rationalized tariff rares and phased out
nontariff barriers. This resulted in strong export growth in 1995. Export
growth, however, decelerated in 1996 to around 11.8%, while imports grew
by 17.9%. Slow export growth and the stagnant inflow of workers’ remittances raised the current account deficit to 3% of GDP, compared with 0.6%
in the previous year. Foreign exchange reserves fell to about $2 billion in
June 1996. External trade recovered after the elections.

Bhutan’s exports incteased by 9.3% to $77 million while imports reached
$104 million. The current account deficit of $48 million (14% of GDP) was
amarked improvement brought about by a contraction in the trade deficit.
The balance-of-payments position had an overall surplus equivalent to
15.4% of GDP in 1996.

India’s export earnings from April to December 1996 reached $24.2 billion,
while imports totaled $27.5 billion for the same period.'' Despite a rise in
the international prices of petroleum products, imporr earnings are expected

to decelerate in 1996 due to a slowdown in industrial and export growth.
For the whole of 1996, the current account deficit is estimated to have
narrowed to $4.9 billion or 1.4% of GDP from $5.4 billion in 1995,

Export earnings in the Maldives increased to $92 million in 1996, which
is. a growth of 7.8% over 1995. This has been achieved through an expansion
in the fish and garments exports. Imports also registered a growth of 10.3%.
With higher official transfers and increases in toucist arrivals, the overall
balance-of-payments position improved strongly, and gross international
reserves reached an equivalent of 3.1 months of import cover.

Nepal’s current account deteriorated substantially in 1996 to an estimated 9.5% of GDP. Export demand for woolen carpet and ready-made
garments was weak, resulting in an export growth rate of about 1.7%. With
imports continuing to grow rapidly, the trade deficit crossed the $1 billion
mark for the first cime.

Pakistan's export growth rate in 1996 was 7%, which was lower than
the 16.1% growth achieved in 1995. Imports grew in 1996 by 16.2%, compared
with 18.5% in 1995. With imports growing faster than exports, the country’s
trade deficit increased to $3.7 billion from $2.5 billion in 1995. The surplus
on the invisibles account absorbed a part of the trade deficit, and the current
account deficit in 1996 was estimated at $4.2 hillion (6.5% of GNP). The
Government undertook corrective measures, such as a devaluation of the
Pakistani rupee and the regulatory duty of 10%, to arrest a possible deteioration of the current account in the second half of 1996.

Sri Lanka's sluggish economic growth in 1996 contributed to a low
demand for imports, particularly of consumer goods and investment matetials. Consequently, imports rose by about 8% in 1996, compared with a 9%
increase in 1995. Export growth was also moderate at 12% in 1996, compared
with growth of 18.4% in the previous year. However, the trade balance is
estimated to have improved somewhat in 1996 to $0.8 billion from $0.9 billion
in 1995. The current account deficit also improved from $546 million in
1995 to $519 million in [996.

Domestic Policies

Compared with the achievements of Bangladesh’s economic reforms in
vecent years, its progress in 1996 was limited, partly because of political
disturbances. On the fiscal side, while tax administration was strengthened
and corporate income taxes reduced, there was little improvement in the
coverage of the value-added tax. In the area of financial reforms, some
important steps were taken to improve the efficiency of the banking system.
In early 1996, a new capital-adequacy system, based on a risk-weighted
measure of banks’ portfolios with a minimun) 8% capital-adequacy ratio,
replaced the previous liability-based minimum-6% capital-adequacy system.
In the external sector, the Government introduced additional trade reforms
in 1996. These included reducing tariff and nontariff barriers, enhancing
external competitiveness, and further liberalizing foreign exchange controls.

In Bhutan, significant progress was made in financial sector reform
with the introduction of government-security auctions, and the conversion of
the Unit Trust of Bhutan into a second commercial bank. In the area of tariff
reform, preparatory work has been undertaken through the liberalizarion of
foreign exchange regulations and the strengthening of the legal framework.

In India, further progress was made in broadening and deepening the
economic and structural reforms during 1996, albeit at a slower pace. The
Reserve Bank of India lowered the statutory liquidity ratio and cash reserve
tequirements, and further liberalized deposit rates in the context of ongoing
financial sector reforms. New guidelines for expenditure management were
announced; these require government agencies to prepare manpower and
expenditure-reduction plans, impose a minimum rate of return for investments undertaken in state-owned enterprises, and improve cost recovery of
utilities. Steps have also been taken to continue the privatization program.
Also, a Divestment Commission was established to implement public enterprise reforms. The upcoming Ninth Five-Year Plan (FY1997/98-FY 2001/02)
will focus on fostering economic growth, employment generation, and poverty
reduction, and will stress the need for infrastructure development, including the provision of an enabling environment for private sector
activities. To ensure sustainability of the growth process and to maintain
macroeconomic stability, India will need to bolster domestic saving and
investment. Further progress in fiscal consolidation, particularly at the
state level, and removal of rigidities in factor markets are the logical next
steps in the reform process.

In the Maldives, the Government is challenged by the need to introduce reforms in the tax system, the financial sector, the exchange and trade
system, public enterprises, and the regulatory environment. This is in view
of its medium-term objective of sustaining an adequare level of economic
growth, while maintaining a viable external position. To achieve this objective, there is a need to introduce new taxes, draft commercial and
bankruptcy laws, and implement more privatization measures.

The Governmenr of Nepal has taken several steps toward atraining
economic stabiliry by controlling the hudget deficit, limiting internal borrowing, strengthening revenue administration, and mainraining price stability. The Government is commitred to implementing a “Three-Year Rolling
Budget” to facilitate project selection and transparency, efficiency, and
accountahility in spending. A new valuation system has been introduced to
improve the efficiency of customs operations, and the process of privatizing
state enterprises has been reactivated. To support poverty reduction, the
Government’s social spending will he focused on education and health care.
Likewise, increased emphasis is being given to sustainahle rural land-use and
labor-intensive programs to protect the environment and provide employment to the rural poor.

Pakistan’s Government is undertaking widespread reforms to increase
the competitiveness of the economy and to spread the benefits of development to ‘the low-income groups. Trade reforms have focused on the reduction of tariff rates and restructuring of the customs system. Tax reforms are
also under way, especially relating to scaling down of personal and corporate
income tax rates. The Government pushed ahead with its privatization plans
in the energy, industry, and financial sectors. Simultaneously, to improve
the provision of basic social services, che Government approved the second
phase of the Social Action Plan (SAP) which covers 1996-2000. The SAP
aims to improve the delivery of hasic social services, especially to those in
tural areas and those aimed ar women. The Government, however, faces
major macroeconomic challenges of reducing the fiscal deficit and narrowing
the current account deficir.ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN DMCs

In Sri Lanka, the Government is attempting to restore macroeconomic
stability, bring inflation under control, and create an environment for normal
growth to resume. An important element in the exercise is to reduce the
budget deficit to about 5% of GDP. In the financial sector, the priorities
of the Government are to privatize public sector banks, establish a mechanism for auctioning government debt instruments, establish rating agencies,
and further open the capital account. Public administration reforms, such
as rationalization of the civil service and government pension scheme, are
being contemplated.

Central Asian Republics”?

The Central Asian republics are economies which are in a state of transition
to market-based systems. Their institutions are undergoing rapid transformation. The database of these economies is being developed, hence information
on them is currently lacking.

Economic Growth

Kazakstan’s GDP in 1996 is estimated to have grown by 0.7%, after experiencing severe contraction in economic activity since independence in
1991. Agricultuse sector production increased in 1996 as a result of normal
weather conditions. Industrial output also increased for a range of products,
such as cast iron, coal, crude oil, and natural gas. The fiscal situation
Temains strained with an overall budget deficit of 2.8% of GDP. Due to some
contraction in output over the last five years, unemployment levels had
grown to 9% by mid-1996.

The Kyrgyz Republic, after five years of negative growth, experienced a
recovery in 1996, registering a 3.5% growth. Reforms in the agriculture sector
resulted in increased crop production. In the industry sector, improvement has
also been recorded as evidenced by increased production of household appliances.

Economic growth in Uzbekistan has been steadily improving since
1993. In 1995, GDP contracted by only 1.2% and the economy is expected
to post positive growth in 1996. The industry sectot experienced better
performance in 1996, particularly in the output of chemical, petroleum,
machine building, mecal working, and wood processing subsecrors. Some
progress has likewise been made in the services sector, resulting from the
privatization of shops and small enterprises. In agriculture, however, grain
production has declined because of poor weather conditions.

Inflation

Kazakstan’s inflation in 1996 was estimated at 39%, a significant improvement from the high level reached in 1994. The introduction of a national
currency in November 1993 and the development of monetary tools by the
Central Bank contributed to the rapid decline in inflation.

Inflation also moderated significantly in the Kyrgyz Republic ro about
30.3% in 1996.

{In 1995, Uzbekistan’s inflation rate was estimated at 516%, compared
with an exceptionally high level (about 1,000%) in 1994. A further drop
of the inflation rate is likely to have occurred in 1996.

External Trade

Kazakstan's merchandise trade deficit in 1996 was estimated at $602 million (approximately 2.9% of GDP), while the current account deficit was
even larger (3.4% of GDP) because of considerable transfers associated
with emigration and increased payments on external debt. The capital
account includes substantial foreign direct investment, ranging between
$850 million and $900 million, the bulk of which was in the metallurgy
and oil and gas subsectors.

The Kyrgyz Republic experienced a widening trade gap estimated
at $366 million due to a surge in imports. However, inflows of official
transfers provided support to the balance of payments, and the country
managed to accumulate a small amount of foreign excbange rescrves.
Experience with attracting foreign direct investment has not been particularly encouraging. The Government is targeting foreign exchange
reserves to increase to about three months of import equivalent by the
end of 1997.

Uzbekistan’s balance-of-payments position has improved during the
past few years. In 1995, exports increased by 29.4% and imports by
31.9%, The trade balance gradually moved toward a surplus in 1995
after suffering from large deficits immediately after independence. Earnings from cotton and gold exports, together with expansion in oil and
grain production, helped improve the country’s external crade position.
The 1996 exchange reserves are estimated to be about six months of
import cover.

Domestic Policies

The Government of Kazakstan continues to implement macroeconomic
stabilization programs focused on the reduction of inflation and the fiscal
deficit. The Government has likewise pursued its privatization program and
has so far transferred housing assets, service-sector enterprises, and small
and medium enterprises to the private sector.

As the Kyrgyz Republic's economy moves toward a market-based
system, one of its major reforms involves the restoration of fiscal balance
through increased revenue collection and a strengthening of tax administration. In ‘this context, civil service reforms have also been initiated to
improve efficiency of public institutions. Social reforms have also been lined
up to target pension systems and social benefits, particularly those for
education and health.

Uzbekistan’s transition from a predominantly state-owned economy
toa market-based economy has been relatively slow, despite the willingness
of the Government to undertake reforms. The Government has continued
to accelerate and deepen the structural reforms, but restoration of economic growth remains a challenge. Many reform programs, such as the
public investment program, reform of nonperforming state enterprises,
and the liberalization of the foreign exchange system, remain unfinished.ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN DMCs

Pacific DMCs"

Although all the Pacific DMCs have subsistence agriculture sectors, which
provide hasic livelihoods fora large segment of their populations, they differ
widely in other important characteristics such as size, resource endowments,
trade and economic relations with other regions, economic growth potential,
and institutional capacity for economic management. Fiji, Papua New Guinea,
and Solomon Islands — which together account for more than 70% of total
Pacific DMC population — have more broad-based resource and economic
structures and inherent development capacity than have most of the other
members of the group. This is rrue especially in relation to the small island
atoll countries of Kiribari, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia,
and Tuvalu. In these countries, the domestic resource base is extremely
lumited with coconut and marine products heing virtually the sole commercial
export items. However, fisheries income derives very largely from licensing
arrangements for foreign fishing fleets rather chan through employmentgenerating domestic fishing industries as in Solomon Islands, where fish
exports ate an important contributor to foreign exchange earnings.

Another important difference among the Pacific DMCs is in the structure of external income. Commodity exports from Papua New Guinea and
Solomon Islands are usually sufficient to generate trade account surpluses,
whereas this is not so fot the other members of rhe group, which all have
significant trade deficits. For Cook Islands, Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu, and,
increasingly also, Western Samoa, tourism is a principal source of external
earnings; and private transfers or remittances from nationals living ahroad
are especially significant for Kiribari, Tonga and Western Samoa. In contrast, official transfers from the US are the main source of external income
in the case of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia.

The relatively large size of the public sector is a common feature of most
Pacific DMC economies, and is one reason why these economies often have
difficulties in adjusting to events such as a reduction in external grant aid
or adverse changes in commodity prices. An expanding role for the private
sector is an essential requirement for diversification of productive activity,
and the development of ability to cope with adverse external circumstances.
Most Pacific DMCs concur with that view but apart from those countries in
which drastic structural change hecame inescapable in recenr years, progress in
most other Pacific DMCs in reducing the role of government has been slow.

Many of the DMCs in 1996 were faced with the need for resolute fiscal
action to deal either with specific problems or with those arising from the
need for fundamental economic restructuring.

In terms of economic management, choice of monetary policy instruments is limited for six of the Pacific DMCs because of the lack of a national
monetary unit. The Cook Islands uses the New Zealand dollar; the Marshall
Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, the US dollar; and Kiribati,
Nauru, and Tuvalu, the Australian dollar. Also, there are marked differences
in governance capacity. In Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, and Western
Sanioa, although there is clearly scope for improvement, information systems

for decision-making, especially as regards budgetary management, are relatively well developed. In Papua New Guinea, the recent devolution of
responsibility to provincial and district lands is promoting severe transitional
problems. Elsewhere, in part because of the difficulties faced by small countries in providing for the range of skills required, the timeliness, scope, and
quality of data available are very much poorer and limit the capacity for
assessing needs as well as performance. In the Cook Islands, substantial
progress has been made under the economic restructuring program currently
being implemented.

The larger economies among the Pacific DMCs accounted for most of
the economic growth that occurred in the Pacific island economies in 1996,

Economic Growth

In the Cook Islands, GDP in 1996 declined by an estimated 5% following
a contraction of similar magnitude in 1995. A major program of economic
restructuring in response to a severe financial crisis is now well under way.

Fiji's economy recovered well in 1996 wirh economic growth reaching
4.4%, compared with 1.4% in 1995. Sugar production showed a small gain
but most of the growth came from other sectors of the economy, especially
mining, manufacturing (such as garment production for export), and those
activities in the services sector that benefited from an increase in tourism.

Kiribati and Tuvalu each maintained growth of around 2%.

Economic growth in Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia,
and Nauru is likely to have been adversely affected as these countries also
began a process of significant sttuctural adjustment.

The Papua New Guinea economy recovered from a contraction of
GDP by 2.9% in 1995, to grow at 2.2% in 1996. Performance improved in
most sectors of the economy but the overall outturn was adversely affected
by a sharp fall in mining output.

Solomon Islands continued to grow strongly though at a lower rate
than in 1995, on the back of its unsustainable rate of forestry logging. Other
sectors of primary industry, except fishing, also contributed to growth, while
the high level of government expenditures provided additional stimulus.

Tonga’s growth contracted from 2.3% in 1995 to 1.6% in 1996.44

Economic activity in Vanuatu continued to be dampened by the effects
of political uncertainty on investor confidence, although some further recovery in agriculture sector output and tourism was a positive factor.

Western Samoa showed strong growth at about 7%, in line with the
sharp recovery experienced in 1995 when the economy staged a sharp
recovery from the effects of the devastation of its main crop, taro. Increased
output of coconut products and further expansion of tourism were again evident.

Inflation

In the Cook Islands, inflation was low, reflecting the rates prevailing in
New Zealand.

In Fiji, prices edged up toward the end of 1996 but the average increase
of 3% over the year was not significantly greater than in 1995,

 

34 For Tonga, 1996 refers to liscal year 1995/96, ending 30 June.ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN DMCs

In the Marshall Islands, some progress was made in reducing the rate
of consumer price increase below the 1995 level of 7%.

Inflation in the Federated States of Micronesia in 1996 is estimated
to remain at its 1995 level.

In Papua New Guinea inflation was much lower at an average rate
of 13% during 1996, in contrast to the 17% recorded in 1995 following the
floating of the kina. By the end of the yeat, consumer prices were some 7%
higher than at rhe end of 1995.

Continued high levels of government spending in Solomon Islands
were an important factor in the inflation rate rising to 12.5% in 1996.

Inflation in Tonga fell steadily through 1995, averaging less than 1%
for the year as a whole. In 1996, however, increased food and housing costs
pushed up the average inflation rate to 2.8%, abour the same as that
experienced hy Vanuatu.

For Tuvalu, inflation declined to 3.4%, a reflection of continuing low rares
of price increase in Australia and New Zealand, the main sources of imports.

In Western Samoa, where inflation was reduced to low levels in 1995
after reaching over 18% in 1994, consumer prices began ro rise again in 1996
as the level of economic activity continued to be strong.

External Sector

The trade deficit of the Cook Islands, although still large, contracted in
1995 as imports declined. A further decline in imports and, hence, in the
trade deficit was in prospect for 1996.

Fiji’s external position improved as a result particularly of a rise in export
receipts, enahling a current account surplus of 0.8% of GDP in 1996 in contrast
to a deficit of 2.4% of GDP in the previous year. External reserves increased
during 1996 to nearly six months of imporr cover.

Large trade deficirs are likely to have continued to be a feature of
the economies of Kiribati and Tuvalu, although in their cases, earnings
from investments, fishing licenses, and external aid are, with prudent
management of public finances, normally sufficient to maintain external
balance.

With exports and imports projected to he much the same in 1996 as
in 1995, the current account deficit of the Marshall Islands is likely to have
remained at around 50% of GDP, financed in large measure by official
transfers from the US.

The position of the Federated States of Micronesia was similar, with
a current account deficit remaining in the region of 60% of GDP.

In Nauru, imports declined significantly following the virtual-closure
of the Bank of Nauru in 1996. The value of exports continued its downward
trend with the drop in phosphate prices, while the negative trade halance
temained lopsided.

For Papua New Guinea, a decline in export earnings, along with higher
import payments, resulted in a sharp fall in the currenr account surplus from
nearly 16% of GDP in 1995 to 3.8% in 1996. Capital account transactions,
however, were sufficiently favorahle to permit a rise in exrernal reserves to
3.8 months’ import cover at end-1996, compared with 2.6 months in 1995.

Solomon Islands’ exports of logs, fish, copra, and palm oil all showed
strong growth, and despite a further increase in imports, the overall positive

balance enabled external reserves to reach the equivalent of two months’
import cover, the highest for many years.

Althongh Tonga’s trade balance worsened, external receipts ftom services,
remittances, and official transfers were snfficient to permit a small contraction
in the current account deficit from 6.8% of GDP in 1995 co 6.3% in 1996.

Vanuatu's external position did not change much from 1995. The trade
deficir widened slightly as imports grew faster than exports. The current
account deficit increased to an esrimated 9% of GDP despite higher receipts
from tourism and official transfers.

‘Western Samoa’s overall balance of payments moved into a small
surplus by the end of 1996, with the improvement in tourism revenues and
strong growth in agricultural exports, combined with continuing fiscal restraint.

Domestic Policies

In the face of increasingly severe fiscal diffienlties, a major restructuring
program in the Cook Islands began in 1996, involving large reductions in
government employment and expenditure, privatization of government
commercial activities, and the introduction of requirements to maintain a
balanced budget. These reforms had profound effects on economic activity
and social conditions in the country.

In Fiji, a rescue package to protect depositors following the insolvency
of the National Bank of Fiji, entailed a substantial rise in the net fiscal
deficit ftom 0.5% of GDP in 1995 to 6.9% in 1996. Measures to contain
the consequent effects on the economy were thus needed.

The Government of Kiribati adopted a new national development
strategy in 1996.

For the Marshall Islands, a principal policy issue in 1996 was the implementation of initial measures to adjust the economy to the progressive decline
of extemal funding. These measures included tax increases and expenditure
reduction, especially through reduction of civil service staff numbers.

The Federated States of Micronesia also initiated programs of structural adjustment by the constituent states in 1996, involving both tax
increases and reductions in public sector employment and expenditure.

Nauru cut its fiscal year 1997 budget by about 50% to Australian
$24 million, Further cuts are planned for fiscal year 1998, along with significant downsizing in civil service and state corporations.

In Papua New Guinea, the generally conservative approach to fiscal
management adopted in late 1994 was maintained with the overall fiscal
balance moving from a deficit of 0.8% of GDP in 1995 to an estimated
surplus of 0.3% in 1996.

The financial position of Solomon Islands Government remained precarious in 1996, Positive action to rein in expenditure, reduce the fiscal
deficit of over 7% of GDP, and clear outstanding payments arrears and debtservicing charges was largely absent. Progress in reducing the extent of
government dominance in the economy was also minimal.

Tonga continued its policies to control rising private sector credit and
overseas fund transfer facing the current account deficit and declining
external reserves.

Tuvalu experienced a higher increase in public expenditure than revenue;
as in 1995, the shortfall was covered by earnings of the Tuvalu Trust Fund.ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN DMCs

Vanuatu’s fiscal position also worsened in 1996, with revenue falling
short of budget and payments arrears increasing. Part of the problem stems
from continued political instability during 1996, but the failure to instirute
reforms to widen the tax base, improve expenditure controls, and reduce
the size of government underlies the financial difficulties that have emerged.

In Western Samoa, in the wake of a series of narural disasters, the
Government has followed a policy of fiscal restrain, and has also promoted
private sector-led growth.

Outlook for 1997
Newly Industrializing Economies

Economic performance in che NIEs is likely to strengthen in 1997 due to
expectation of increased exports. It may be recalled that growth of these
economies decelerated in 1996 due to decline in export growth, which began
in che latter part of 1995 and continued in 1996. Cyclical facrors that caused
the decline in export growrh are anticipated to bottom out, and the economies are set for relatively higher growth. In the medium term, having
achieved relatively high growth and per capita income, the NIEs will face
the challenge of sustaining growth by moving to higher-level technology and
more capital-based production.

Hong Kong’s economy is expected to recover further in 1997 with an
increase in GDP to around 5%. Investment activity is expected to remain
strong, consumer demand is likely to strengthen, and exports are projected
to pick up. Sectoral developments point to a steady increase in the construction sector and a strong performance in export of services. Growth in
tourism should provide a boost ro the economy in 1997.

In the Republic of Korea, economic growth is forecast to decelerate
further to about 6% in 1997 as the contractional phase of the business cycle
is projected to continue in the first half of the year. Improvements in
investment activity and exports, the two areas that have supported growth
in the past, are likely to be slow because of existing structural problems. The
Korean production structute has been observed to have been somewhat
rigid; structural adjustment measures may need to be vigorously pursued to
bring the economy back on track. Several policy measures will continue to
be taken in 1997 in line with OECD norms.

Singapore’s real GDP growth is expected to improve marginally to
around 7.5% in 1997. Singapore’s economy is largely dependent on exports
and reexports, and is highly vulnerable to global economic downturns. With
the favorable developments anticipated in the global trade environment, the
economy’s revival is imminent. The diversification strategy of the manufacturing base will also help push the economy into producing more sophisticated products.

Taipei,China’s consumption and investment expenditures are expected
to improve moderately, and result in slightly higher GDP growth of around
6.2% in 1997. Export performance will improve as rhe economies of its large
trading partners, the US and Japan, improve. Taipei,China's financial system needs to be restructured as it could depress the economic potential of
the country. The Government is playing an active role in determining and
promoting industries in which the economy has distinct comparative advantage

81ANNUAL REPORT 1996

and in which it can continue to compete globally. In this context, Taipei,China
has launched its comprehensive and ambitious plan, the Asia-Pacific Regional
Operations Center Plan.

People’s Republic of China and Mongolia

The PRC's strong economic performance is forecast to continue for the next
two years. GDP is expected to grow by about 9% in 1997. The Government’s
agricultural policies are expected to tesult in the sector growing by about
4.5% per annum. Given normal weather conditions, grain production is
expected to increase on average by 10 million tons next year. Industrial
production is expected to grow at a rate of 11.1% in 1997, in line with the
Government's efforts to prevent overheating, and to rationalize the investment
and production patterns of state-owned enterprises. The services sector is
forecast to grow at a rate of close to 8% per annum. The fiscal situation
of the Central Government over the next two years depends on the buoyancy
of tevenues and the extent to which state-owned enterprise reforms are
implemented. The gradual easing of monetary policy could put some upward
pressure on prices in 1997. The PRC’s export performance is anticipated to
improve in 1997,

Growth prospects in Mongolia are modest. Growth is forecast at 34%
per annum for 1997. Agriculture and industry are each projected to grow
by about 3%. The services sector is expected to grow by 4%. These projections
assume that economic policies continue to address problems in the banking
sector, that incentive structures in agriculture and industry are improved;
that structural reforms in public sector enterprises are pursued; and that
renovation of thermal plants and modernization of coal mines to imptove
the reliability of power and heat supply are continued. Inflation is expected
to decline to 40% in 1997. On the external side, the balance-of-payments
position is anticipated co deteriorate fucther in 1997. The current account
deficit is projected to increase to 10% of GDP.

Southeast Asia

Southeast Asia is expected to maintain a high growth rate in 1997, albeit
at a decelerated pace than witnessed in the first half of the 1990s. Overall
average economic growth is projected to remain around 7.3%, only marginally higher than in 1996. The economic outlook of Indonesia, Malaysia, and
Thailand is not likely to change significantly in 1997, partly as a result of
restrictive fiscal and monetary policies aimed at containing inflation and
improving the current account position, and partly because these economies
are in the process of reorienting their production structure to technologically
more advanced products. The Philippines and Viet Nam are well poised to
post high, medium-term sustainable growth. The outlook for Cambodia,
Lao PDR, and Myanmar is contingent upon these economies pushing ahead
with the reform process in conjunction with macroeconomic stability. Overall,
the economic growth for Southeast Asia will be largely supported by relatively
strong domestic private consumption and investinent demand, improvement
in cxports, and appreciable inflows of foreign investment.

Indonesia’s economic growth is projected to remain close to 8% in
1997. The non-oil manufacturing sector is expected to maintain its role asECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN DMCs

the leading sector in spurring growth. The utilities and construction sectors
are also anticipated to perform strongly. Foreign confidence in the country’s
economic performance and management has remained strong, which is a
positive factor in sustaining economic growth.

Malaysia's GDP growth in 1997 is expected to be in the region of 8%,
close to the 8.8% growth achieved in 1996. The monetary and fiscal stance
is expected to remain restrictive to contain the widening current account
deficit. The economy is, however, subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which need to be addressed in the medium term. These include
vulnerability to external shocks because of limited substitution possibilities
of imports with domesric production, and greater volatility of exports; excessive reliance on monetary policy to deal with pressures of overheating
which raises the prospects of attracting volatile short-term capital inflows;
and having achieved near-full employment, the country needs to pay more
attention to accelerating the pace of increase in total factor productivity,
including substantially upgrading the technical capabilities and skills of the
labor force.

The Philippines is faced with the challenge of sustaining the relatively
high growth it has achieved since 1993. The Philippines’ GDP is expected to
grow by about 6% in 1997, slightly above the 5.5% growth in 1996. The GNP
growth could be in the range of 7-7.5%. Recent structural reforms have significantly reduced macroeconomic distortions and further liberalized the
economy. Private investments are being further driven by the opening up of the
telecommunications and banking sectors. In the absence of weather-induced
crop failures, agriculture should also contribute to better economic performance.

Thailand’s economic growth slowed down in 1996, while the current
account deficit was high. A marginal increase in the growth rate is likely
to occur in 1997 as external demand revives. Growth in agriculture sector
output is likely to be sustained at the current level, while the industry and
services sectors are likely to pick up. Important concerns in the medium
term include macroeconomic imbalances, such as a widening current account deficit and savings-investment gap, and potential loss of competitive
advantage in labor-intensive exports.

Viet Nam's GDP is expected to grow by 9.5% in 1997 provided the
Government does not falter on the IMF Program and the pace of structural
reforms is not slackened. Industry will remain the fastest-growing sector, expanding
at a rate of 13.3%, with agriculture growing at 4.5%, and services at about
10.8%. The medium-term prospects for the economy appear to be positive.

The oucdook in 1997 for Cambodia is relatively buoyant. Real GDP is
estimated to grow at about 6.5% in 1997. This is based on the assumption
that weather conditions will be favorable, and that the Government will
continue to pursue sound macroeconomic policies in line with the objectives
set under the ongoing ESAF arrangement with IMF.

For the Lao PDR, growth in GDP is expected ro slow down to 7.5%
in 1997,

The success of Myanmar in the coming years and the long-term
sustainability of its economic growth depend critically on the ability of the
economy to implement market reforms and to achieve macroeconomic
stability. On the anticipation that the progress toward market-oriented
reforms continues, and the macroeconomic imbalances are addressed, the
economy should grow at a faster rate during 1997,

Bangladesh's growth target for 1997 is 5.4%, given normal weather conditions. The Government is committed to revitalizing the agriculture sector,
enhancing gtowth of exports, developing domestic industries to attract
foreign investment, and creating opportunities for employment. To keep
inflation at a low level of 4%, appropriate monetary management should
be pursued.

GDP growth in Bhutan is forecast to increase by 5% in 1997, and
inflation is expected to moderate. Exports are projected to increase and
imports are anticipated to grow ata higher rate. The current account deficit
is likely to increase.

India should be able ro achieve a GDP growth rate of around 7% in 1997,
provided the reform process is expedited. With good weather conditions and
an increase in procurement prices, the agriculture sector should remain dynamic
while growth is anticipated to pick up in the industry and services sectors. Export
performance is also expected to improve significantly, and with a revival in
demand for imports, the currenr account deficit is expected to widen, albeit
within the comfortable range of 1-2% of GDP in 1997.

GDP growth in the Maldives is projected at 6% in 1997. Improvements
in the agriculcute sector are expected with enhanced methods of fishing, and
in the services sector with the opening of more islands to tourism,

Nepal's economy should experience a growth rate of about 4.5% in
1997. Agricultural production should increase with favorable climatic conditions, while industrial production is expected to revive with improved
export prospects. Lifting of restrictions on foreign investment in industries
will also contribute significantly to the improved performance of this sector,
which is projected to grow by about 6%. The services sector is forecast to
grow by 5% in 1997. Close watch will, however, have to be kept on the
current account deficit.

Pakistan's economy should grow at a rate of abour 5% in 1997, provided
progress can be achieved in restoring macroeconomic stability. This is contingent upon the Government vigorously pursuing structural reforms to
improve the comperitiveness of domestic industry. In particular, Pakistan
needs to become better geared to face the challenges posed by the evolving
inrernational economic environment. On the domestic front, policies which
promote sustained and equitable socioeconomic developinent need to be
pursued with detetmination.

An improvement in Sri Lanka’s economy could take place in 1997 as

apparel, leather products, food and beverages, and tobacco.

Central Asian Republics

For Kazakstan, brisk activity is anticipated in private farms, auto transport
services, and retail and restaurant services in 1997. Unreconstructed enterprises
of the former Soviet Union, however, continue to exert a dampening effect
on growth:ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN DMCs

In the Kyrgyz Republic, the target growth for 1997 is 9%, following
positive results of the government reform programs. Some success has been
achieved in combating inflation, and in 1997 inflation is projecred to drop
to a low 16-17%. As a result of renewed investment in the Kumtor gold
mining operation and a subsequent decline in imports, the current account
deficit is expected to decline in 1997. Foreign exchange reserves are forecast
to increase to approximately three months of imports by the end of 1997.

Uzbekistan’s growth for 1997 and 1998 is expected to be moderate.
Agriculture will continue to benefit from improved institutional structures.
With some attendant difficulties from downsizing and closure of some
enterprises, the industry sector could still reap gains from increased
activities in the energy and mining sectors. The services sector is likewise expected to post a modest growth as a result of improved output
in the industry sector.

Pacific DMCs

Prospects for the Pacific DMC economies in 1997 are for modest growth
ar best among some of the larger economies, and for low or negative growth
among the stmaller.

In the Cook Islands, a further fall in GDP is in prospect as the
structural reforms bite deeper.

Fiji's GDP growth rate is likely to recede to 3.2%. Although tourismrelated activities should provide further stimulus, a contraction of construction, low growth in sugar output, and a more modest performance of mining
will be offsetting factors. The fiscal deficit is expected to increase to over
8% of GDP, largely because of continued outlays associated with che restructuring of the National Bank of Fiji. On the exrernal account, Fiji’s current
account surplus is projected to increase to 1.8% of GDP, and reserves to
be maintained at about six months of import cover.

GDP in the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia
is expected to decline further, as a result of more pervasive structural reforms.

The economy of Nauru is expected to conrract further following a
trend that began in 1992.

Papua New Guinea is expected to grow somewhat faster in 1997 by
about 3%. Though oil output will be lower, most other sectors of the
economy will grow at rates higher than in 1996 in some cases. The fiscal
deficit in Papua New Guinea is expected to narrow down to 0.9% of GDP
in 1997. The current account deficit is likely to deteriorate to about 3%
of GDP, as lower exports lead to a fall in the trade surplus and higher debtservice payments result in a rise in the deficit on the services account.

Economic growth of Solomon Islands should be below that in 1996,
as logging activity becomes less buoyant, and government activity is less
expansionary than in previous years.

Growth in Kiribati, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu should remain at
about 2%, the same as in 1996. Fiscal deficits are likely to continue in
Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Western Samoa.

Western Samoa’s growth rate is expected to maintain its strength at
about 6%.

85Infrastructrire development reduces constraints to
economic growth: the Second Highway Project in
Thailand was supported by the Bank with a
$110 million sector loan, approved in 1989,Operational Priorities
and Policies

PY HE PRIORITIES and policies discussed in this chapter reflect the

. Bank’s strategic development objectives, including the emphasis on
policy dialogue with its developing member countries (DMCs). In 1996, in
the context of its strategic framework, the Bank again offered DMCs a
country-hased, integrated approach to development, linking project financing with policy support, capacity building, and regional cooperation. The
Bank's policy on program lending, in particular, was strengrhened to support
the promotion of sound, market-oriented policies in DMCs.

Strategic Framework and Operational Agenda

The Bank's strategic development objectives, as defined in The Bank's
Medium-Term Strategic Framework (1995-1998), are to

* promote economic growrh;

* reduce poverry;

* — support human development (including population planning);
* improve the status of women; and

* protect rhe environment.

The rationale for these objectives is that economic growth is necessary
to reduce poverty, hut by irself is nor enough to raise the living standards
of the poor, women, and other disadvantaged groups. Hence, employment
and income-generating opportunities clearly directed at target populations
must be promored. At the same time, economic growth must be sustained
through protection of the environment.

As a management tool for planning, programming, and monitoring the
implementation of these overall Bank objectives in its operations, the Bank
has adopted a classification system that relates individual projects to the five
strategic development objectives. The system follows specified criteria, and
distinguishes when a project is aimed primarily at meeting a Bank strategic
objective other than economic growth and when it has the former as a
secondary objective. This tool enables the Bank to track whether the mix
of projects and the distribution of loans by ohjective are in line. with its
overall development agenda, as well as with its DMCs' development ptiorities (see Classification of Projects by Objective table on page 88).

The Bank achieves its strategic goals by delivering integrated development services to its DMCs. Besides lending from its own resources, rhe Bank
also mobilizes additional flows of investments for the projects it assists, both
through cofinancing and through promoting capital markets in DMCs. At the
same time, the Bank advises and supporrs DMCs in relevant policy formulation and reform; is an active partner in capacity building for development
management; and facilitates regional and subregional cooperation.

Since the needs in DMCs vary, the Bank tailors its assistance to each
DMC through country assistance plans that translate country-specific
operational strategies into work programs. The Bank undertakes this planning process in full consultation and partnership with each DMC, analyzing
the country’s needs in each sector, and identifying where the Bank has a
comparative advantage in its services.

Policy Initiatives and Policy Support

With the evolution in the Bank’s role from project financing to that of
providing an integrated range of development assistance, increased emphasis is placed on policy analysis and reform in all lending and advisory
activities. Accordingly, the ahility and means to support policy changes in
DMCs have become strategically essential.

Program Lending: In particular, program lending plays an important part
in the Bank’s effort to promote sound, market-oriented policies in its DMCs,
After having reviewed its program lending ope rarions and policies, the Bank
introduced important amendments to the policy framework. These were
implemented in 1996. The review allowed the Bank to assess accornplishments and progress made since the introduction of the policy-based program
lending instrument in 1987. The overall impact of program lending has been
positive. Program loans have nade a significant contriburion to the adoption of market-based, outward-looking policies in key sectors of DMCs,
which have improved efficiency and performance. While delays were occasionally encountered in the
implementation of reform
measures, compared with

envisaged, the overall

accelerate the adoption of
necessary policy reforms. In
addition, a new sector development program modaliry has been introduced;

with a view to addressing sector needs more comprehensively. The new
program lending policy also emphasizes sector analysis as a precondition for
program lending; assesses the policy performance record and ptograms of
DMCs; gives attention to social and environmental issues, including mitigating measures in case of adverse short-term impacts on the poor; and
reviews budgerary allocations to and within the sector to ensure that essential needs are met.

There were seven program loans approved in 1996, one each to Cambodia,
Cook Islands, India, Lao PDR, and Mongolia, and two to Viet Nam. The
first sector development program, which is in the Mongolia education sector,
was also approved in 1996; several others are now being prepared.

Another important development was the introduction of wide-ranging
structural reforms in several Pacific DMCs, which the Bank supported
through broad adjustment programs. In the Cook Islands, for example which is not a member of either the International Monetary Fund or the
World Bank — ADB helped design and support, in cooperation with key
bilareral donors, a comprehensive macroeconomic stabilization and adjustment program.

While program loans conrinue to be a key instrument of the Bank for
supporting broad programs of sector policy reform, policy analysis and reform
ate an integral and essential part of all Bank operations. Therefore, project
and sec tor loans systematically review and assess the policy and institutional
frameworks in the sector concerned, engage in policy dialogue with rhe
relevanr government authorities, and seek to correct deficiencies, if any,
through policy conditions attached to investment loans. Economic and
sector work and technical assistance operations are designed to support a
well-defined agenda of policy dialogue and reform. Many advisory technical
assistance grants are specifically designed to analyze key policy issues, or to
strengthen the policy formulation and implementation capacity of major
government agencies.

Policy Agenda: The Bank’s policy agenda encompasses a wide range of
issues, including the regulatory and legal frameworks for growth, trade and
investment regimes, relative roles of the private and public sectors, pricing
and tariffs, cost recovery, good governance, decentralization, beneficiary
participation, and social and environmental issues. For example, in 1996,
the Bank worked closely with the Environmental Impact Management
Agency (BAPEDAL) of Indonesia to encourage the decentralization of
environmental management, which is considered essential for effective monitoring and enfotcement of environmental standards promulgated at the
national level. To this effect, the Bank will help prepare a master plan for
che establishment of provincial, district, and municipal environmental impact
management agencies, and investigate means for strengthening the systems
and procedures for environmental management at the local level. The Bank
also assisted the Government of Indonesia in carrying out comprehensive
resource mapping and resource-use planning in its land and marine resource
evaluation projects. In the People’s Republic of China (PRC), the Bank
provided technical assistance to enhance private sector participation in
infrastructure development, by helping structure build-operate-transfer projects
in the critical power and road subsectors. In Sri Lanka, the Bank supported
a comprehensive efforr at public administration reform, comprising

Rural Microenterprise Finance in the Philippines

RURAL POVERTY in the Philippines,
measured in terms of the capacity of a group
to meet specified minimum needs (poverty
threshold), continues to increase in absolute
terms. Income is inequitably distributed,
despite periods of strong economic growth,
which slightly reduced absolute poverty and
had no impact whatsoever on unequal income distribution. Weak periods of economic
growth, on the other hand, worsened the poverty situation and further widened the disparity berween the rich and poor. Overall,
the pattern of economic growth has been inequitable and has not been accompanied by
a growing share for the poorest.

The Philippine financial system is divided
into a formal market, which consists of a
wide array of banking and nonbanking institutions performing various intermediation services, and an informal sector. The difficulty
the poor have in
partly because the structure of the financial
system is biased avainst them. Banks rarely

institutions, including rural banks, are reluctant

  

and ill-equipped to service the microenterprise
sector, particularly the poor.

With the continued growth in the number
of unemployed and underemployed, landless
rural workers and other disadvantaged

  

oups,
particularly women, the high levels of peverty in the rural areas are unlikely ta be reduced
significantly. However, if these inequities can
be corrected through investments in financial services, the ultra poor could help

themselves. Access by the poor to adequate and

 

appropriate Rnancial services is a critical factor
in helping break the poverty cycle.

through the GBA; the proposed project will

Recognizing the importance of water as an essential and increasingly
scarce resource that requires careful multisectoral management, the Bank
organized in May 1996 a regional consultation workshop aimed at helping
in water sector policy formulation. Wirh the participation of almost all
DMCs, and strong representation from other international agencies, the
private sector, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the workshop
was an important step in the process of formulating a water sector policy
that reflects the views and needs of all parties and sectors concerned. This
Bankwide effort was supplemented at the country level by assistance to
water sector policy formulation in Sri Lanka, where a national water resource
center and secretariat were established in 1996. Similar initiatives to support
sector work in this area were also launched in the PRC and the Lao People's
Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). The linkage between the Bank’s policy
agenda and its operational program was further strengthened in 1996 in the
new Country Assistance Plans, which include a synopsis of the Policy Support
Program in each DMC. The increased emphasis on policy supporr and
teform in Bank operations reflects and reinforces the evolution of the Bank
from a simple project financier, concerned with individual investment projects,
to a broad development catalyst and agent of change, concerned with the
overall policy and institutional environment for growth.

Social Dimensions

It is increasingly recognized that people are the center of development, and
that development is for all people. The concept of social dimensions captures the key elements of human perspectives in development, including
poverty reduction, enhancing the role of women in
development, human’ development, and avoiding or
mitigating the adverse effects of development interventions on groups that do not have the capacity to
absorb such effects. The Bank recognizes the importance of incorporating social dimensions in all its development efforts and operations, and making social
dimensions a major consideration in the formulation
of development strategies, including operational strategies; the translation of these strategies into operational
programs; and the design, implementation, and evaluation of development programs and projects:
Promoting a balance between economic growth
and social development continues to govern the Bank’s
development efforts in the Asian and Pacific region.
The focus on the social aspects of development is
sharpened by the fact that an ever-increasing number
of the region’s population lives in poverry despite the

(1995-1998) and The Report of the Task Force on Improving Project Quality
reflect the Bank's commitment to the social dimensions of development.

The Bank continually refines its activities by reorienting policies and
practices toward its objectives of poverty reduction, enhancing the role of
women, human development, beneficiary participation, and protection of
vulnerable groups. The Bank emphasizes these social dimensions in all
aspects of its operations.

During 1996, 31 of the 76 public sector projects approved included
components that reflected the Bank’s social development concerns. While
continuing to review all new loan and technical assistance proposals in
light of the Bank’s social dimensions policies, efforts to improve on these
policies and to advance new ones were underraken during the year.
Existing policies on women in development and cooperation with NGOs
are being revised to reflect the Bank’s expanding role and operational
agenda in these areas. Work continues on developing policies to recognize and help protect indigenous peoples’ interests, and to hasten the
pace of poverty reduction. Guidelines on participatory development have
been established.

Poverty Reduction: Despite progress already achieved in poverty reduction,
the problem persists in most DMCs. The magnitude of the task of lifting
more than half a billion people in the region from a life of abject poverty
is daunting. Economic growth is a necessary but not a sufficient condition
for reducing poverty. The Bank recognizes this fact, and works to help the
poor through targeted direct assistance for income-generating opportunities.
In addition, improving access to health, family planning, education, and

From Policy to Action: Community Model Schools in Pakistan

TWO THIRDS of the world’s women over the age of 25 years have never been
to school, and 60% of illiterate people are women. Yet, there is concrete evidence
to suggest that the returns from education are higher for females than for males
There is also increasing evidence that demonstrates a positive correlation between the education of females and reduced poverty, improved health, nutrition
and welfare of women and children, and reduced fertility rates.

In Pakistan, Jireracy rates for women are under 25%, and primary school
enrollment for girls, only about 50%. Most of the country’s primary schools for girls
have only wo rooms tor five grades. This school environment leads toa dropout rare
of over 50% for girls by grade five, and accounts for low female enrollment rates.

but also assures the sustainability of economic growth.

In the last decade, the Bank has increasingly incorporated poverty
reduction as an implicit element in all its projects. Heightened concern for
poverty reduction encourages the Bank to underrake core projects that
increase incomes and provide employment opportunities, as well as to highlight this concern when formulating conventional projects. Poverty issues
are also considered systematically during country strategy and operational
programming exercises. During 1996, 15 public sector projects either were
aimed primarily at achieving poverty-reduction targets or included poverryreduction components. These projects were mostly in the microfinance,
agriculture and rural development, health, water supply and sanitation, and
infrastructure sectors.

Two regional technical assistance studies focusing on poverty reduction
were completed during the year; a study is in progress on the povertyreducrion impacts of Bank-assisted projects, and preparation of a project
to address poverty reduction in the Greater Mekong Subregion began.
Several country-specific poverty reduction technical assistance grants
were approved during the year, such as the Rural Income Generation
Project and the Coastal Community Development and Fisheries Resources Conservation Project, both in Indonesia. The Bank participated
in activities sponsored by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest
(CGAP), a multidonor group that provides grants to enable poor people
to become progressively more productive. Also during 1996, the Bank
began preparing for the Fourth Meeting of CGAP, which the Bank will

93ANNUAL REPORT 1996

Women in Development: The Bank recognizes that improvements in
the status of women are integral to achieving its other strategic
development objectives, such as poverty reduction, economic growth,
development of a healthier and better-educated society, and overall
sustainable development. Investments in women are now widely
acknowledged as crucial in achieving sustainable development, in that
poor health, low education and training levels, and limited access to
resources not only liinit women’s quality of life but also their contribution
to economic efficiency and growth. Public policies and investments that
improve the starus of women have such benefits as improved public
healtb, low infant and maternal mortality, lower fertility rates, increased
life expectancy, and reduced health and welfare costs. The Bank’s policy on
women in development, adopted in 1986, is currently being revised.

During 1996, the Bank approved three projects that were classified with
either the primary or secondary objective of improving the status of women.
For example, under the Second Girls Primary School Sector Project in
Pakistan, an estimated 300,000 girls will receive basic education. In Viet
Nam, the Population and Family Health Project is expected to benefit
750,000 women and 1.7 million children directly.

Protection of Vulnerable Groups: Vulnerable groups include children, the
aged, tribal people, ethnic minorities, illegal settlers/squatters, people at the
bottom rungs of the social ladder, disabled people, and new and old immigrants. They are often poor and socially powerless, with very little capacity
to absorb economic and social shocks. Thus, the costs of adjustment imposed
on the vulnerable groups may be out of proportion to their capacity to bear
such burdens.

The Bank is aware that while carrying out policy adjustments,
institutional reforms, and project investments aimed at improving economic
efficiency, enhancing growth, and protecting the environment, it is
necessary to provide safety nets to the vulnerable groups that may be
adversely affected. Compensating adversely affected people is in rhe
interest of equity and overall social harmony. In its
development activities, rhe Bank follows the principle
that as a result of an adjustment, reform, or
investment, no group will be worse off, and at least
some groups will be better off than before.

Throughout the year, new projects were reviewed
to pay particular attention to how these would affect vulnerable groups. The Bank continues to systematize its approach to vulnerable groups through
the preparation of policy papers and guidelines. In
1996, the Bank started drafting its Handbook on
Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice for carrying
outits policy on involuntary resettlement. Also during
the year, substantial work was completed on a policy
to address the needs of indigenous peoples. Coun— try-level consultations on an indigenous peoples’

94OPERATIONAL PRIORITIES AND POLICIES
ea a aS}

Participatory Approach to Development: Participatory development is
a process through which stakeholders can influence and share control
over development initiatives that affect them directly, as well as decisions and resources that are part of development initiatives. Participation
facilitates rhe inreraction of each stakeholder group in development
initiatives in a more equirable and collaborative manner. If stakeholders’
interests are not identified and addressed befare commitments to development are made, these interests often will emerge during project implementation, thereby compromising the effectiveness and sustainability of
initiatives in place.

In the past, some of rhe Bank’s investment projects have focused on
increasing outpurs or providing physical or other infrastructure, without
paying enough attention to people who would use either the outputs or
the infrastructure services. Examining the impact of these projects has led
the Bank to accept that many of the potential benefits of the investments
have not been achieved fully, owing to inefficient or inappropriate use of
che outputs or infrastructure. Also, adverse impacts of these projects on
people and the environment often were not adequately addressed. As a
result of these experiences, the Bank is increasingly according greater attention to beneficiary concerns, including identifying the potential clientele
for the project, as well as their needs, constraints, and demands; their
capacity to organize, participate, manage, operate, and maintain project
facilities; and their ability and willingness to pay for the project and its
services. All new projects are reviewed so that the priority requirements of
the people can be successfully met, and that the facilities concerned be
operated, managed, and sustained after project completion.

Some areas in which the Bank sought active beneficiary participation
in the design, implementation, and/or maintenance of project facilities are
in livestock development, water supply and sanitation, agriculture, energy,
area conservation, rural infrastructure and irrigation development, education, and family health and nutrition. In November 1996, the Bank published Mainstreaming Participatory Development Processes into Bank Operations,
a handbook describing how the Bank is institutionalizing participatory
development processes in all stages of the project cycle. The regional technical assistance project, Facilitating Capacity Building and Participation
Activities, was approved during 1996, providing funding to support specific
small-scale participation activities.

Cooperation with NGOs: Identified as a key associated process for the
Bank to achieve its strategic objectives, cooperation with NGOs involves
efforts to identify and develop the means to facilitate the participation
of NGOs in project activities as well as in the formulation and implementation of development policies and strategies. In local-level project
activities, NGOs have a distinct advantage in helping identify the needs
of affected persons and communities, and in engendering community
participation. Project sustainability is difficult to achieve unless projects
are designed in cooperation with the beneficiaries. Also, NGOs often
have an advantage in delivering development goods and services to the
harder-to-reach segments of the population.

NGOs play various important roles in development. Many NGOs are
familiar with the specific needs and capabilities of the people, and usually

promote self-help and self-reliance among people through innovative
approaches. Cooperation with NGOs may result in more effective assistance
ro the poor and disadvantaged groups of the population in meeting their
basic needs, and support improved natural resource management and
conservation activities in DMCs. There are many well-organized and
experienced NGOs in the Bank’s DMCs.

In 1996, 25 new projects involving NGOs during project conceptualization or implementation were approved. These projects were in
water supply and sanitation, rural infrastructure, education and health,
irrigation, microenterprise, energy, livestock, rural credit, transport, and resource
management. NGOs are also widely involved in technical assistance activities,
and are becoming involved in country programming work.

Informal meetings were held throughout the year to address specific
policy and project questions. More formal discussions were held during the
Bank’s 1996 Annual Meeting, when a seminar on Bank cooperation with
NGOs was held. Also during 1996, country consultations were undertaken
to assist in developing a revised Bank-NGO Cooperation Policy. A regional
technical assistance project to study NGOs in nine of the Bank’s Asian
DMCs was approved during the year.

Human Development: Investment in people — human resources — is a
viral part of development, and is one of the Bank’s strategic objectives.
Educated, skilled, innovative, and healthy people are the major contributors
to economic growth. Human development relates not only to education
and skills development, but includes investment in such vital areas as
health and population, water supply and sanitation, and urban and rural
development. Such investment will help improve the skills, living standards and quality of life of present and future generations of people, and
will help increase their contribution toward sustained and accelerated
economic growth.

Countries that neglect these aspects of human development are
likely to suffer the consequences of slow and inadequate economic growth,
with poor technology and a mismatch of labor supply and demand, often
coupled with rapid population growth. Investment in sectors such as
health, education, training, and related services, as well as population
planning, not only benefits the people receiving these services, but also
accelerates economic growth and helps to sustain it over the long term.

The Bank's operations that directly address human development cover
the sectors of health and population, education, water supply and sanitation,
and urban development. A total of 23 projects approved during 1996 included
human development either as a primary or secondary objective.

Social Infrastructure

The development of social infrastructure is an important operational priority
of the Bank. Social infrastructure provides the enabling foundation for
future economic growth. It improves people's general welfare, and satisfies
the basic needs of the vulnerable. The development goals of DMCs are met
through Bank investments in education, heafth and population, waterBank Assistance for Mongolia to Restructure

supply and sanitation, urban development, housing, and tourism.! These
investments ditectly reflect the Bank’s stcategic development and operating
objectives. For example, expanding both formal and nonformal basic education
improves skills and productivity; increasing public access to adequate health
care and sanitation services improves public health and welfare; and providing
convenient access to an adequate and safe water supply sarisfies a basic
human need. Expanded private sector involvement in financing and deliveting social sector services is supported by the Bank, as are capacity building
and strengthening of social sector institutions. Improved financing mechanisms for social services, poverty reduction, and safety nets are given high
priority, as ate greater decentcalization and devolution of authority to local
governments.

The Bank's specific objectives in social infrastructure sectors are as
follows.

Education: The economic and social rates of return on investment in
education, especially basic (primary and lower secondary) education,
tend to be among the highest rates of return on all investments. The
Bank therefore aims to support the education seccor needs of its DMCs
by improving the quality of, and increasing access to, formal and nonformal
basic and secondary education, and postsecondary education. This provides
a sound foundation for gtowth and improves equity. To realize gender
equality, the Bank either invests in the subsectors where che interests
and needs of women are prominent, such as primary and nonformal
education, or targets women through special progtams chat will expand
their income-earning opportunities. Provision of skills development, and
technical and vocational education and training, supports productivity
growth. Rehabilitation and strengthening of education systems ate a
particular concern in the transition economies.

Basic primary, lower secondary, and nonformal education are the focus
of newly approved projects in Cambodia, Indonesia, and Pakistan, and of
ongoing projects in Bangladesh, Kazakstan, Lao PDR, Nepal, Pakistan, and
Philippines. New technical assistance grants for these sectors have been
approved for Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Pakistan,
Uzbekistan, and Viec Nam. The efforts in che Lao PDR and Pakistan specifically target women and girls. In Thailand, a technical assistance grant
will develop nonformal secondary education. For Indonesia, a grant will
strengthen in-service teacher training. A new project in Indonesia supports
higher-engineering education, while a new project in Thailand will upgrade
the skills of minimum-wage earners to improve their employment opportunities. Technical assistance grants for Lao PDR, Philippines, Thailand, and
Viet Nam will also improve skills development and vocational training. In
Mongolia, che Bank’s first sector development program and accompanying
cechnical assistance support restructuring of facilities and rationalization of
staffing co promote increased quality, effectiveness, and sustainability of the

education sector. Support for rehabilitation and institutional strengthening has started with a project in
Kazakstan, an ongoing technical assistance grant in
the Kyrgyz Republic, and new technical assistance grants
in Mongolia and Uzbekistan. A technical assistance
grant in indonesia will help determine the policy options to improve the efficiency of resource allocation.
Finally, a regional technical assistance grant will bolster
rraining and labor market flexibility across the Greater
Mekong Subregion.

Health and Population: The Bank’s main objective
for the health and population subsector is to improve the quality of services, increase efficiency,
and widen access, patticularly for women and

tion, decentralization, and devolution to the local level, are important
to achieve the overall objective.

A project for Cambodia to increase the efficiency of basic health
services will pilor-test contracts with private sector service providers. A new
basic heaith project in Indonesia uses the family as the focus of interventions.
A technical assistance grant in Pakistan supports the development of a
project specifically designed to meet the needs of women. A project integrating population and family health services in Viet Nam supports the
Government's priority for family planning and health. Technical assistance
grants in Bangladesh and Cambodia address institutional, financial, and
management concerns in the sector.

A regional technical assistance grant will help identify health policies
and priorities, and will provide the basis for developing a new health policy
for the Bank. Also, a regional technical assistance to estimate the extent
and identify the causes of child malnutrition is being implemented in partnership with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).

Water Supply and Sanitation: Access to adequate supplies of safe drinking
water and complementary sanitation facilities is critical to the health and
well-being of the population. The Bank’s main operational objective is to
ensure the provision of reliable and safe drinking water and sanitation
services. These services should meet basic needs, be cost effective, sustainable, and affordable. Appropriate water and sanitation services are necessary
to support human development — both in urban and rural ateas; improve
the status of women; and protect the environment. Water supply and
sanitation components are often included in integrated urban development
projects to provide a balanced package of development benefits. The Bank
also suppotts institutional capacity building for water and sanitation agencies, environmental protection, NGO and community involvement, and participation of the private sector in water supply development, management, and
maintenance.

During 1996, Cambodia, PRC, Indonesia, Nepal, Philippines, and
Thailand were the principal recipients of financial and technical assistance

for the development and improvement of water sources, water treatment, distribution systems, and wastewater disposal facilities. Institutional improvements were initiated for water and sanitation agencies,
including the strengthening of financial management, operational efficiency, and cost recovery; human development; and reducing water
losses. The treatment and disposal of municipal and industrial wastewater have also received increased support from the Bank, including the
two loans for the Anhui Environmental Improvement Project in the
PRC, and technical assistance for the Bangkok Metropolitan Region
Wastewatet Management Project. In 1996, the Bank remained closely
involved with the privatization of the water supply in Manila and Colombo,
identified the potential for private sector involvement in water supply in
the cities of Bandung and Medan in Indonesia, and conducted a seminar
on build-operare-transfer (BOT) projects in the water supply sector in the
PRC. The water supply projects in Cambodia, Nepal, and Philippines incotporate extensive community/NGO patticipation, In 1996, the Bank also
continued its involvement in improving the efficiency of water supply operations
in several DMCs, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Pakistan,
Philippines, and Viet Nam, mainly through the reduction of unaccountedfor water and management improvements, including revenue-generating
and cost-saving measures.

Urban Development and Housing: Rapid urbanization is emerging as a
major development issue for many of the Bank’s DMCs, and the trend is
expected to continue well into the next century. The Bank encourages
an integrated approach to urban development, aimed at delivering a
balanced range of infrastructure and services to meet basic needs and
improve living conditions, particularly for the nrban poor. The subsectors
covered include water supply and sanitation, flood control, drainage,
solid waste management, roads, urban transport, and land development and
housing for low-income groups.

Through the Bank’s projects, emphasis is given to developing and
strengthening the capability, capacity, and operational efficiency of the
institutions and agencies responsible for the delivery, management, and
maintenance of urban setvices. The Bank supports measnres to mobilize
local resources by broadening the tax base, improving revenue generation,
introducing cost-recovery mechanisms, setting appropriate consumer charges,
including cross-subsidies for the urban poot, and improving the efficiency
of revenue collection. The Bank also promotes the participation of the private
sector in urban development, including water supply, wastewater and solid
waste management, and the contracting out of public services.

In 1996, an integrated urban development ptoject was approved for the
Bogor- Tangerang-Bekasi area which is a patt of greater Jakarta in Indonesia.
This project has provision for extensive private sector participation,
particularly in water supply and solid waste management, and includes
a study of the water resource management issues in a regional context.
Another Indonesian project, the Regional Development Account, strengthened loan financing of local government investments. In addition, technical
assistance was approved to prepare urban development projects for Bhutan,
Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Philippines, and Western
Samoa. Regional technical assistance was approved to address majorOPERATIONAL PRIORITIES AND POLICIES

urban issues, including megacity management
and urban infrastructute finance. A patticular
focus of this work was on innovative
financing mechanisms, including funding
through bond issues and private investments,
and examples of best practices.

Multisector: Structural difficulties are similar
among many DMCs and across social sectors.
Thus, there are advantages to be gained by
considering these on a crogs-sectoral and subregional basis. One such program is the Second Social Action Program (Sector) Project
in Pakistan. Another is a technical assistance
grant in Mongolia, which addresses staff and
restructuring issues in education and health,
Technical assistance grants are supporting the
restructuring of service delivery, emphasizing
in particular the decentralization of resource
mobilization and responsibility in Kazakstan
and the Kyrgyz Republic. In Mongolia, che
poverty reduction program is being strengthened to help address the difficult adjustments
needed in the transition from a centrally
planned to a market-driven economy.

Environment

Assistance for Major Reforms in Gujarat State, India

ONE EXAMPLE of the Bank's initiatives in the area of good governance and
capacity building may be found in Gujarat State, one of the most progressive
and reform-oriented states in India, recognized for its strong industrial and
economic growth potential. However, Gujarat faces wide-ranging structural
problems: a precarious fiscal position, an inefficient state-owned enterprise
sector, and growing infrastructure deficiencies. To adclress these problems, the
Government of Gujarat decided to launch a fundamental reform program
encompassing key layers of the public sector. With support from a Bank loan,
the Government of Gujarat has committed itself to a reform program to
(i} manage prudently state public finances; (ii) divest and restructure state
enterprises; and (iii) strengthen the policy, regulatory, legal, and institutional
frameworks for private sector participation in critical infrastruccute secrors.
To complement the support provided under the loan, the Bank’s assistance includes a package of rechnical assistance grants for capacity building
of key institutions that have a crucial role in designing and implementing the
reforms. The package consists of (i) a $600,000 technical assistance project to
strengthen the Finance Department in budget policy formulation and projection, treasury functions, expendirure management and control, revenue
collection, and debt management; (ii) a $600,000 technical assistance project
ro train policymakers and heads of state enterprises in the modalities and
techniques of privatization; and (iii) an $850,000 technical assistance project
for capacity building and strengthening of the Gujarat Infrastructure Development Board, the body responsible for attracting, and for setting policies and
procedures for, private investment in Gujarat infrastructure projects.

 

The Bank is committed to promoting environmentally sound development
in the region. To fulfill this objective, the Bank (i) reviews the environmental
impacts of its projects, programs, and policies; (ii) encourages DMC
governments and executing agencies to incorporate environmental protection measures in their project design and implementation procedures, and
provides technical assistance for this purpose; (iii) promotes projects and
programs that will protect, rehabilitate, and enhance the environment and
the quality of life; and (iv) rrains Bank and DMC staff in, and provides
documentation on, environmental aspects of economic development. In
reviewing the environmental impact of its projects and programs, the Bank
visits the sites, discusses with government officials concerned and affected
beneficiaries, and reviews the environmental impact assessments (EIAs)
made for the projects and programs. This ensures that all possible alternatives were explored and the best chosen. It also ensures that appropriate and
cost-effective mitigation measures were incorporated into the project design,
environmental economic analysis was done, as required, and that the
suggestions of the affected public were taken into account in designing the
project. In compliance with the Bank’s policy on disclosure of information,
summary EIAs for environmentally sensitive projects are circulated to members
of the Board and to the public, providing them the final opportunity to
comment on the reports. The Bank monitors the implementation of the
agreed environmental inanagement plan. It also evaluates lessons learned,
thereby improving the environmental design of similar future projects.

101ANNUAL REPORT 1996

The Bank also promotes projects that will protect, rehabilitate, and
enhance the environment and the natural resource base. It assists its borrowers
in the conceptualization of such projects. The Bank’s annual lending portfolio
continues ro have an increasing share of environmental projects.
‘The Bank also encourages DMC governments and executing agencies
to incorporate environmental protection measures in their project design
and implementation procedures. It assists DMCs in this regard by providing
technical assistance grants to build their environmental management capacity,
and to support reforms in their environmental policies, legislation, and
regulations. In 1996, several DMCs became recipienrs of these grants.
The Bank continues to promote regional as well as subregional cooperation
on critical environmental issues that transcend national borders. It also
actively pursues cooperation with other international and bilateral organizations, including environmental organizations, on vatious environmental
aspects of development.

 

Support for Good Governance and Capacity Building

In 1996, the Bank expanded its efforts to promote good governance and
capacity building for effective management of the development process. The
Bank’s assistance largely focused on strengthening three areas: (i) policy
analysis and sector planning; (ii) effective management and delivery of
public sector development services; and (iii) government capacity to create
an environment conducive to the growth of the private sector. About 65%
of the Bank’s loan projects in 1996 included components in support of good
governance and capacity building. Of the 286 technical assistance projects
approved in 1996, 155 projects (including 32 regional technical assisrance
projects) had good governance or capacity-building objectives. Many of
these projects were in support of reforms in social infrastructure, agriculture
and natural resources, and financial services.

Within the Bank, training programs for staff were conducted to upgrade
skills in diagnosing and resolving good governance and capacity-building
issues. A regional technical assistance on Facilitating Capacity Building and
Participation Activities approved in 1996 was also provided by the Bank to
pilot-test a new mechanism for responding to urgent, high-priority needs for
capacity building and participation. Experience gained from this pilot facility
is expected to help the Bank develop more flexible modes of assistance,
particularly for process-oriented interventions.

Asian Development Bank Institute

The Bank's approval of the establishment of the Asian Development Bank
Institute (ADBI) in Tokyo was a major accomplishment in 1996. The ADBI
will have the following as its major objectives: (i) identify effective development
strategies; and (ii) improve the capacity for sound management of the
agencies and organizations in DMCs engaged in development work. Achieving
these objectives will contribute toward the promotion of sound and forwardlooking development strategies and policies in DMCs, the strengthening of
institutional capacities to design and carry out development programs and
projects, and the widening of participation in the development process. The
ADBI will be a major focal point for research on innovative developmentOPERATIONAL PRIORITIES AND POLICIES

strategies to accommodate the diversity and complexity of social conditions
in Asia, and for training in development management for policymakers and
senior managers from DMCs.

The target clientele of ADBI’s research activities include institutions,
groups, and individuals engaged in development work in DMCs. For the
training programs, the target clientele include middle to top-level policymakers
and officials of public and private development institutions in DMCs. Nonprofit
private sector institutions may also participate in the Institute’s activities.
The ADBI will also develop collaborative links with other institutes that
share its interests. These partnerships will enable the Institute to bring
collective experience and expertise to bear upon a particular issue or subject,
or to expand the delivery and dissemination of particular lessons or skills.
Such collaboration will enable the ADBI to strengthen capacities and skills
of the regional and national institutes in member countries.

103The Bank financed the development of
educational equipment in Bangladesh through a
$6 million interest-free loan, approved in 1978.Operations

HE BANK'S operations comprise lending, equity investments, and

technical assistance. Through loans, the Bank finances specific projects
to support developing member countries’ (DMCs) efforts to improve the
policy, institutional, and investinent environment of sector development,
and to help meet the short-term costs that policy adjustments entail. Through
the Bank's equity investment operations, which complement domestic resources
and encourage other external resources to finance the private sector, a wider
range of productive private enterprises is possible. Through technical
assistance, DMCs are able to identify, design, implement, and operate development projects, as well as strengthen their ability to formulate development
strategies, policies, programs, and plans. Technical assistance also promotes
technology transfer and enhances regional cooperation. After a short discussion
of each, this chapter examines the Bank’s operations in rhe public sector.

Technical Assistance

The Bank's technical assistance is financed through grants or loans, or a
combination of both. Grants are funded from voluntary contributions to the
Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) by both developed and developing member countries; regular allocation to TASF from ADF; reflows
from reimbursable technical assistance; annual transfer of OCR net income
to TASF; annual contributions received from the Japan Special Fund (JSF);
and grants from multilateral and bilateral sources (under joint and exclusive
financing arrangements). See also Cofinancing and Guarantee Operations on
page 123, and Special Funds chapter on page 163.

During 1996, technical assistance grants were approved for 286 projects
amounting to $175 million (an increase of 21% in dollar amount from 1995).
The amount included $37.1 million for regional activities. Technical assistance components of loans amounted to $335 million, the same as in 1995.
For details, see Tables 31, 33, and 34 in the Statistical Annex.

Sixty-four of the Bank’s 1996 loans, involving an amount of $3,508 million, resulted from earlier technical assisrance projects. Of this, $2,569.6 million
were from OCR and $938.7 million from ADF. For details, see Table 32 in
the Statistical Annex.

Total. Cost of Projects

The 92 loans approved during the year (some projects involve more than
one loan) involved an estimated total project cosr — which includes Bank,
government, and cofinanciers’ contributions — of $21.2 billion (see Table 9
in the Statistical Annex), Bank financing of these projects in loans, equities,
and grants amounted to $5,594 million or 26% of the toral cost. Borrowers
and/or governments provided $10,146 million or 49%. About $5,177 million
or 24% were financed through cofinancing from official and commercial
sources, equity sponsors, and local financial institutions. Project beneficiaries
and subborrowers provide about $296 million or 1% of the total project cost
(see Sources of 1996 Loans on page 110 and 1996 Total Cost of Loan Projects
and Sources of Financing on page 111). This is another indication of the
Bank’s catalytic role in mobilizing resources not only through policy support
and capacity-building activities, but also in project financing.

Review of Operations

Lending to the public and private sectors during 1996 increased slightly
in volume (0.7%), while the number of loans increased substantially
(24%) to 92 from 74 in the previous year. The rise was largely due to
an increase in the number of laans to Cambodia, People’s Republic of
China (PRC), India, Indonesia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia,
Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, and Viet Nam, as well as an increase in
sector and program loans. The first project to Uzbekistan for a loan of
$50 million was approved during the year.OPERATIONS

are supportive of the macroeconomic framework of the country. At the project level,
clearly identified objectives and priorities,
identification of target groups, patticipation of the intended beneficianies in project design and implementation, and institutional capacity
building lead to successful performance.

During the year, loans to the agriculture and natural resource sector
totaled $769.8 million for 22 projects in 12 DMCs. In addition, 47 technical
assistance grants, amounting to $46.33 million, were approved for the sector
to support project preparation, institutional strengthening, research activities,
policy reforms, and service enhancement.

The 1996 lending program reflected the Bank’s continuing concern
with poverty reduction, improving the status of women, and environmental stabilization. In particular, there was a significant increase in the
number of projects addressing crosscutting issues as their primary objective. Those directed primarily at poverty reduction were the CommunityManaged Irrigation Sector Project in the Lao PDR; the Second Irrigation
Sector and rhe Third Livestock Development projects in Nepal; the
Bahawalpur Rural Development Project in Pakistan; the Bukidnon
Integrated Area Development, the Rural Microenterprise Finance, and
the Cordillera Highland Agricultural Resource Management projects in
the Philippines; and the North Central Province Rural Development
Project in Sri Lanka. The Forestry Sector Project in Bangladesh; the
Integrated Pest Management for Smallholder Estate Crops, and rhe
Segara Anakan Conservation and Development projects in Indonesia;
and the Klang River Basin Environmental Improvement and Flood
Mitigation Project in Malaysia! were designed as poverty reduction or
environmental protection projects. The Norrh Java Flood Control Sector and South Java Flood Control Sector projects in Indonesia had
human development as their primary objective. The remaining projects
addressed crosscutting issues as a secondary objective.

 

{The Klang River Basin Environmental Improvement and Flood Mitigation Project is classified

under “Others” in the Statistical Annex.OPERATIONS

Rural development, forestry, and natural resource management projects approved during the year emphasized the importance of incerporating beneficiary participation into project design
at an early stage to promote ownership and improve operational
efficiency. Additional emphasis has been placed on the involvement of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to enhance local
community participation, reduce dependence on government institutions, and improve transparency. Projects with a high degree
of beneficiary participation were the Forestry Sector Project in
Bangladesh; the Second Irrigation Secror and the Third Livestock Development projects in Nepal; the Bahawalpur Rural
Development Project in Pakistan; and the Bukidnon Integrated
Area Development and the Cordillera Highland Agricultural
Resource Management projects in the Philippines.

Energy Sector

The Bank’s strategy in the energy sector is to assist DMCs in improving energy efficiency in both supply and demand, integrating
environmental considerarions in energy development, and enhancing
private sector participation in funding large-scale energy projects.
The institutional focus in the power subsector is on corporatization
and commercialization of government-owned utilities, and subsector

structuting to promote competition in the areas of power generation and
power distribution in particular. The development of policy and regulatory
frameworks to promote economic use of hydrocarbon resources, and protect
the interests of both producers and consumers of such resources, is a key

objective in the hydrocarbon subsector.

Loans to the energy sector totaled $1, 100.6 million in 1996. Of this,
$788.6 million were in the electric power subsector and $24 million in the
hydrocarbon subsector. Overall, the loans reflected the Bank’s thrust in

the power subsector for energy efficiency and environmental
protection. For example, the Energy Conservation Project in
Mongolia was intended to improve the efficiency of the district
heating system in its capital, Ulaanbaatar. The Power and District
Heating Rehabilitation Project in the Kyrgyz Republic was aimed
to improve the country’s energy generation and transmission
efficiency. The goal of the loan to Bangladesh was sector reform
through tariff adjustments, comniercialization, corporatization,
and privatization. Hydropower development and supply-side efficiency improvements were the objectives of loans to Lao PDR,
Nepal, and Pakistan.

Tn the hydrocarbon subsector, one loan amounting to $24 million
was made to Sri Lanka to rebuild petroleum storage facilities damaged
by an explosion and fire.

Altogether, 29 technical assisrance grants were provided in the
energy sector for a cotal of $13.58 million. These were meant to
support activities such as the preparation of feasibility studies for
future projects; power system planning, privatization, corporatization,
and commercialization; environmental improvements, and electricity tariffs, rationalization, sector regulation, and legislation.

long-rerm domestic debe financing that is required to meet the region’s
rapidly growing needs for infrastructure. Here, too, a strong emphasis is
placed on regulation of financial markets, although the weight of the emphasis
is placed on developing self-regulatory mechanisms.

Underpinning rhe Bank's overall assistance to DMCs in the financial
sector is the recognition of the crucial role played by the sector in
promoting the allocation of saving to the most productive investments.
Improved allocation of saving promotes increased growth, as well as
higher incomes and saving. Under a regulatory framework that promotes
market-based provision of financial services, the competition within the
sector will also help ensure efficiency with reduced intermediation costs.
Such a financial system will tend co be more flexible and resilient when
confronted with domestic and external shocks, and will contribute to
macroeconomic stability.

303.00 (ADF)

 

110Five loans amounting to $213 million were made in this sector during
1996. The Bank provided a loan to the PRC, packaged with an equity
investment, in a nationwide commercial bank (Everbright Bank of China).
This represents the Bank’s first-ever external equity position in a nationwide
commercial bank in the PRC, and is aimed ar encouraging the adoption of
modern commercial banking skills and creating a “best practices” commercial bank to serve as a model within the banking sector. This “best practices”
development program, which will extend Everbright’s operations into project
finance, is expected to take five years. Two loans were made to India: one
for facilitating private sector participation in the infrastructure sector and
the other for strengthening public finance in the State of Gujarat, while
reducing the role of the public sector in commercial activities. This second
loan is also intended to introduce market-oriented policies to accelerate
industrial and infrastructure development.? One loan was provided to the
Lao PDR for the second financial sector program, Two loans were provided
to Mongolia, both aimed at stemming Mongolia’s rapidly deteriorating banking
system from further collapse, and thereby reducing systemic risks and gradually restoring market confidence. These loans involved the transfer of basic
hanking skills into every aspect of banking operations, from undertaking
credit analysis and imposing credit controls, to rationalizing branch operations.
The loans also focus on improving the overall governance of Mongolia’s
commercial banks through corporatization and privatization, thus ensuring
an effective and sustainable domestic commercial banking system. A loan
extended to Viet Nam seeks to develop a market-based financial sector
which would broaden private sector participation, thereby increasing savings
mobilization, and improve the efficiency of resource allocation through a
greater reliance on market mechanisms.

In addition, 21 technical assistance grants for financial sector development in DMCs were approved in 1996 for a total of $9.5 million. These
were aimed mainly at institutional strengthening and capacity building of
financial institutions, including banks, NBFls, and capital markets institutions. For details, see Table 35 in the Statistical Annex.

Industry and Nonfuel Minerals Sector

In the industry sector, the Bank seeks to encourage and support the effective
operation of markets. Generally, this entails a reduction in government
involvement in production, and is achieved through the establishment of
market-oriented and outward-looking policies, promoting reforms in stateowned enterprises, and encouraging privatization. However, in situations
where the market cannot be relied on to produce the most desirable outcomes,
the Bank plays an important role in identifying and assisting in the introduction of rhe most-efficacious interventions. The Bank has played an
important role in environmental improvement projects related to industrial
discharges in the PRC and Indonesia. Similarly, there is some concern that
market outcomes may result in the provision of inadequate standards and
testing, and the Bank has provided a loan to Indonesia which aims to
strengthen the institutional structure and testing capabilities of industrial

Classification of Country Groups

UNDER the Bank’s general classification,
Group A countries are those with a per capita
GNP of less than $695 in 1995. Twenty-four
DMCs have been classified as Group A. These
include some Pacific DMCs with a per capita
GNP higher rhan $693 in 1995. They have
been classified as Group A because of their
special economic circumstances.

Group B countries are these with a per
capira GNP between $866 and $1,618. Group
B includes Indonesia with a 1995 per capita
GNP of $980, and Papua New Guinea and
the Philippines with a per capita GNP of
$1,160 and $1,070, respectively. Kazakstan,
Nauru, and Uzbekistan have also been classified as Group B countries.

Group C DMCs had per capita GNP of
$2,017 or more in 1995.

However, the Bank’s policy is that such
cutoff points need not be used rigidly for
classifying countries. Size, remoteness, and
istinctive features also influence
ification.

needs of industry.

Loans to this sector totaled $192 million in 1996. Seven technical
assistance grants totaling about $3.89 million were approved during the
year. The purposes of these grants were energy conservation, environmental
improvement, and promotion of private sector trade and industry through
institutional strengthening of government agencies concerned. For details,
see Table 35 in the Statistical Annex.

Social Infrastructure Sector

Investments in social infrastruccure, including education, health and
population, water supply and sanitation, and urban development, complement
efforts to directly promote economic growth and reduce poverty. Improved
social conditions are a fundamental goal of development and, therefore, projects aimed directly at improving social conditions are a
central part of rhe Bank’s operations. Investments in education and
health and population improve the well-being of children in the
short term and enhance their income-earning potential over time. |

The Social Action Program (Sector) Project I1— a sectoral project
in Pakistan for which the Bank provided a loan of $200 million — will
provide continuing support to improve and expand services in the social
sectors. This will include education, health, and rural water supply and
sanitation.?

Six projects for an aggregate of $165.6 million, approved in the water
supply and sanitation subsector, accounted for 23% of social infrastructure
lending. The Phnom Penh Water Supply and Drainage Project in Cambodia;
the Anhui Environmental Improvement Project for Municipal Wastewater
Treatment in the PRC; the Water Supply and Sanitation Project in the
Federated States of Micronesia; the Fourth Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project in Nepal; and the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Sector and the Small Towns Water Supply Sector projects in the Philippines
were all designed to improve public health by providing access to adequate,
safe, and reliable water supply and sanitation facilities, particularly in
low-income and high-density housing areas. A salient feature of these
projects is the enhancement of people's participation in, and the development of, institutional frameworks for sustainable public utility
management. The projects use participatory approaches to achieve partial
and/or full-cost recovery in the provision of water supply and sanitation
services, and aim at strengthening the capacity of institutions responsible
for the planning, implementation, and operation and maintenance of the
public urility services.

Two projects amounting to $90 million, provided to the urban development
subsector, accounted for 9% of social infrastructure lending. The Metro
Bogor, Tangerang, and Bekasi (BOTABEK) Urban Development Sector
Project in Indonesia adopts an integrated urban approach, while the Regional
Development Account Project in Indonesia aims to improve access to longterm credits for small-scale municipal investments.* Both projects provide
support in the development of basic urhan infrastructure and services such
as water supply and sanitation, terminals and inarkets, solid waste management, and institutional development. They will help both regional and
central governments to improve their capacity in providing basic infrastructure
and municipal services to rapidly expanding urban areas.

One project for $17.2 million was approved in the tourism subsecror.>
The Second Tourism Project in Nepal addresses environmental and infrastructure deficiencies that were constraining tourism in the country. The
project was designed to blend critically needed infrastructure improvements
with the extension of ecotourism development and environmental protection of key tourist destinations, especially to. strengthen local government
capabilities to manage urban infrastructure and services more effectively.

A total of 46 technical assistance grants amounting to $24.49 million
were approved during rhe year for the social infrastructure sector. Of these,

development, policy strengthening, development of local government
institutional capacities, particularly in transition economies, and management of delegated responsibilities for the delivery of social services, such as
education, health, and social security. In addition, four regional technical
assistance grants were approved: the Second Water Utilities Data Book for
the Asian and Pacific Region, the Study of Regional Health Policy Priorities,
Cooperation in Employment Promotion and Training in the Greater Mekong
Subregion, and Reducing Child Malnutrition in Eight Asian Countries.

Transport and Communications Sector

Bank lending to the transport sector is focused on alleviating bottleneck:s
and constraints to economic development by rehabilitating and improving
existing infrastructure, improving transport efficiency, providing necessary
capacity, and selecrively constructing high-priority transport links. Sector
operations increasingly address che changes associated with the provision of
transport infrastructure and operations. The considerable demand for additional
infrastructure, as well as resources to operate and maintain existing facilities,
is placing a severe strain on national resources. If economic and social
development is not to be constrained by increasingly congested and inefficient
networks, even greater investment will be required in the future. With
limited public sector budgets, substantially more resources will be required
from private sector sources. Bank operations are increasingly focusing on. the
need to define the role of both the public and private sectors and to provide
a suitable framework to enhance opportunities for the participation of the
private sector. In creating the righr conditions, the Bank is actively pursuing, rhrough policy dialogue, the need to examine existing institutional
setups to define constraints to accessing capital and expertise of private
sector institutions.

As with all Bank activities, the environmental and social sustainability
of projects is carefully examined during project preparation. This aspect
is especially important in this sector. Wherever necessary, mitigation
measures are provided to reduce adverse impacts, and project facilities
are conceived in a wider developmental context, taking into account
social considerations. Prolonged sustainability also requires institutions
with the capability and skills to implement, operate, and maintain
infrastructure as well as to define future needs. Development of human
resources is an important part of sector operations, and capacity-building
components are featured in many projects.

In 1996, 14 loans totaling $1,489 million were approved for the transport and communications sector. Three loans were made ta the PRC to
develop portions of rhe planned national trunk highway system. Under these
operations, the Bank explored the desirability of operating the tolled facilities as corporatized entities, and eventually using them to raise additional
resources for future infrastructure development via stock offerings, bond
issues, and/or leasing arrangements.OPERATIONS

Associated technical assistance also provides the framework for facilitating the introduction of the build-operate-transfer (BOT) modality in the
highways sector, and enabling the private sector to assist in road sector
development.

Road projects in Kazakstan and the Kyrgyz Republic were primarily to
rehabilitate existing roads which had deteriorated due to severely constrained
budgets resulting from difficulties associated with economic transition. Both
loans followed considerable policy dialogue on the need to restructure road
sector operations to introduce efficiency and effectiveness, and to apply
realistic road user charges to improve pricing regimes and raise revenues.

Technical assistance was also provided to address institutional issues and
undertake urgently required capacity building. In Bangladesh, the construction of national roads to connect the new Jamuna Bridge with the existing
network to Dhaka and beyond was approved, while Viet Nam received a
loan for the improvement of the main artery, National Highway No. 1
hetween Hanoi and the PRC horder. The Philippines received a loan to
improve national roads, provide accessibility in remote poor areas, strengthen
existing roads reaching the end of their design life, and repair and retrofit
bridges to minirnize risks of seismic failure. The loan also incorporates
substantial capacity building for highway planning, routine road maintenance, road safety, road resealing training, and pavement investigation
analyses. Policy dialogue was also an important feature in preparing the
project, and focused on improving road operations and maintenance, strengthening highway planning and resource allocation, and addressing

road safety, road classification, and vehicle overloading.

In the PRC, a loan was made to construct a new railway line Transport and Communications Loans" and
between Daxian and Wanxian, which is located in one of the least- Technical Assistance Grants, 1996

but will also improve air traffic safety.
A loan to expand port operations and improve efficiency at Fancheng Port
in the PRC is expected to promote economic growth in a relatively poor
hinrerland. The loan will modernize port operations, improve transport linkages
and accessibility to the hinterland, and provide urgently needed capacity.
The Bank’s telecommunications sector strategy is tailored to the needs
of each country. For India, the strategy is to accelerate the development

 

 

115ANNUAL REPORT 1996

of an efficient and effective sector to promote economic growth, and to
obtain “universal” access. This is to be achieved through mobilizing and
coordinating the integrated development and expansion of the network to
provide balanced regional development, and to support policy, regulatory, and
institutional reforms. Access to telecommunications will facilitate business efficiency, employment opportunities, and the delivery of social services in the
rural areas. For Thailand, the strategy redresses imbalances in the network,
which have resulted in inadequate rural coverage and lack of accessibility
to information by disadvantaged groups; and promotes planned and orderly
reform for the deregulation and privatization of the sector.

The telecommunications project in India promotes private sector
participation in the provision of telecommunications services such as public
call offices; and supports the sector-restructuring initiatives of the Government by focusing on network expansion in the rural areas. A significant
institutional change was the formation of the Telecommunications Commission
to promote rapid development of all aspects of the telecommunications
sector in India, including technology, production, and services. The private
sector is providing mobile phone services in four major cities. Further, the
private sector has heen invited to provide value-added services such as
paging services, electronic voice/mail services, data services, audio text
services, video text services, and video conferencing.

Policy actions in Thailand for the deregulation of the sector were
formulated through Bank technical assistance for restructuring the
telecommunications sector. The project was approved

and communications sector, mainly to support project
formulation and preparation, institutional strengthening, policy reforms, and service improvement.

Environment Activities

In 1996, the Bank continued to assist its DMCs develop or reformulate their environmental regulations,
huild capacities for environmental planning and management, and promote regional cooperation in several
environmental areas of importance to the region. The
Bank also ensured that the environmental impacts of
projects aenreyed during the year were thoroughly reviewed, and mitigation
measures introduced to ensure compliance with national and/or international standards, as required. Efforts were also focused to ensure that targets
for projects with environmental objectives were achieved. To complement
these efforts, several resource cenrer and training activities were conducted.

In support of their efforts to develop their environmental regulations
or standards, rhe Bank provided technical assistance grants to Bhutan and
the Philippines to formulate appropriate environmental quality standards,
and assisted the PRC in preparing and revising its environmental and
natural resource legislation.OPERATIONS

The Bank also provided technical assistance to develop and/or strengthen
the environmental management capacity of Cambodia, PRC, and Lao PDR.
In Cambodia, Bank assistance focused on strengthening the national
environmental agency’s use of environmental impact assessment as a tool to
ensure environmentally sound economic development. Bank assistance in the
PRC focused on promoting the transfer of clean technologies to town and village
enterprises. In the Lao PDR, technical assistance was provided to strengthen
the country's capacity for integrated regional economic-cum-environmental
planning at the river-basin level. Sustainable development and conservation
of narural resources in the Nam Ngum River Basin is expected.

The Bank promoted regional cooperation in a technical assistance to
address coastal and marine pollution in countries bordering the South China
Sea. Similar effort was also supported by the Bank to prevent and mitigate
the impact of greenhouse gases in several DMCs, and of acid rain in Northeast Asian countries. To address common environmental concerns crucial
to the promotion of environmental sustainability in the Greater Mekong
Subregion,® the Bank provided a regional technical assistance for environmental
training and institutional strengthening in priority envitonmental areas.

In 1996, $368 million, or about 7% of the total lending for public sectot
projects of $5,389 million, were provided for projects with primaty environmental objectives. Such projects aim to promote the sound management of natural
resources and the environment, and such components are valued at more than
50% of the total project cost. Projects that also aim to promote the sound
management of natural resources and the environment, and with environmental
components estimated at no less than 20% of total project cost, amounted to
$368 million. Total Bank funds for these two categories of envitonmental projects
amounted to $736 million. Compared with last year’s lending for the same type
of projects estimated at $631 million, this year’s lending level represents a 17%
increase over the previous year’s lending level.

Eight projects with primary environmental objectives were apptoved in
1996. One was a Forestry Sector Project for Bangladesh which covers various
forestation, conservation, and natural forest management activities in line
with the Forestry Sector Master Plan, prepared with Bank assistance. Three
were for Indonesia: The first, the Segara Anakan Conservation and
Development Project, aims to conserve, develop, and sustainably manage
the Segara Anakan Lagoon/Marine Complex in Central and West Java. The
second project, the BAPEDAL (Badan Pengendalian Dampak Lingkungan
[Environmental Impact Management Agency]) Regional Network, aims
to (i) establish institutional capacity at the regional level to set environmental standards, improve environmental awareness, and provide
environmental management and support services; and (ii) strengrben
BAPEDAL through human development at the regional and national
levels. The third project, the Integrated Pest Management for Smallholder
Estates Crops, aims to promote the adoption of cost-effective, environmentally
sound integrated pest management practices by smallholdet estate crop
farmers. This will be achieved pattly by strengthening selected government
institutions and farmer groups.

In the interior province of Anhui, PRC, the Bank funded two Anhui
Environmental Improvement projects that are expected to support

 

6 Cambodia, PRC, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.

117ANNUAL REPORT 1996

enviromental improvements and institutional reforms initiated by the Anhui
Provincial Government to arrest environmental degradation of the Chao
Lake Basin. In Malaysia, the Bank funded the Klang River Basin Environmental
Improvement and Flood Mitigation Project, which adopts an integrated
approach to provide an improved level of environmental management and
coordination, and flood protection in the Klang River Basin. The project
isexpected to improve environmental conditions, address development needs,
and minimize the adverse economic, social, and environmental impacts of
flooding in the river basin. A project in Nepal, Second Tourism Development, was also designed with primary environmental objectives. The project
blends critically needed improvements in infrastructure, ecotourism, and
environmental protection at key tourist destinations.

Projects with secondary environmental objectives funded by the Bank this
year include the Phnom Penh Water Supply and Drainage Project for Cambodia,
the North China Marine Culture and Coastal Resources Management, and
Second Industrial Energy Efficiency and Environment Improvement projects for
the PRC; and Renewable Energy Development Project for India.

To ensure that environmental impacts of Bank-funded projects are
initigated to acceptable levels, the Bank reviewed the environmental impact
assessment reports and summaries of reports prepared by borrowers of
environmentally sensitive projects. In 1996, a total of 21 summary environmental impact assessment reports were citculated 120 days before Board
consideration of the respective projects to give interested groups another
opportunity to comment on the environmental aspects of the projects.
Queries forwarded to the Bank concerning some of these projects were
resolved satisfactorily. This year also saw the incorporation of the social
aspects of projects into the Bank's mainframe-based Environmental Monitoring
Information System (EMIS) that initially was limited to the project’s
environmental aspects. The merging of both crosscutting concerns into one
information system is expected to greatly enhance the mainstreaming of
these aspects in Bank lending operations.

The Bank also undertook several resource center activities. To build
the environmental management capacity of DMCs, studies focused on the
review of environmental legislation and its effective enforcement; use of
market-based instruments for environmental management; and review of
che environmental conditions and issues in the Central Asian republics. To
provide directions in its future operations, country-focused environment
papers were prepared. A Planning Framework for Environmental Management
Capacity Building in DMCs was also prepared to assist in formulating multiyear
technical assistance programs for building environmental management capacity
in a country, The Bank’s Study on Emerging Asia, which includes a review
of future environmental challenges in the region, is expected to assist the
Bank in charting its environmental strategy and program in the 21st century.

To increase staff awareness on environmental matters, various papers were
published focusing on economic valuation of environmental impacts, indicators
and indexes; regional cooperation; and the promotion of investments in environment in the region. To share its experiences and exchange views on key
regional or country-specific environmental issues, the Bank met and discussed
with various organizations, including Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific (ESCAP), United Nations Development Progranune (UNDP),
United Nations Environment Programme (ONEP), multilateral developmentOPERATIONS

banks, and several bilateral organizations. The Bank also participated in seminars
and workshops within and outside the region.

Social Development Activities

In contrast to che sectoral focus of the Bank’s project activities, social
development is a concern extending across the Bank's operations. Social
development is based on a framework encompassing the entire range of the
Bank’s policies and procedures, and applies at each step of the Bank’s
operational cycle. The Bank’s focus on social development is based on the
fact that despite the relatively high and sustained rates of economic growth
achieved within the region, poverty remains endemic in many DMCs, and
that development must address all people.

Social development encompasses poverty reduction, enhancing the role
of women in development, and addressing issues of involuntary resettlement. It also includes efforts to avoid or mitigate the adverse effects of
development interventions on vulnerable groups that do not have the capacity
ro absorb them. It is the Bank's strategy to incorporate these social dimensions in its development efforts and operations.

Human development, including population planning, is an important
part of social development, and is recognized as one of the Bank's strategic
objectives. The rapid development of human resources is widely recognized
as a necessary condition for sustaining high rates of economic growth. A
number of studies have confirmed that investments in human development,
especially in primary education and preventive health care, yield significant
gains in productivity and income. At the same time, beyond any relationship
between human development and economic growth, improvement of the
quality of life must be regarded as a developmental goal in itself.

Although the Bank’s DMCs grew rapidly during the 1980s, more than
half of the world’s poor are still in Asia. Special efforts were undertaken
in 1996 to assist many DMCs face the challenge of sustaining economic
growrh through investments and policy adjustments and reforms, while
providing opportunities for the poor and disadvantaged groups to benefit
from growth. Economically disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, the majority of whom are women, are likely to be affected adversely and be unable
to absorb the shocks induced by policy reform, development investments,
and environmental regulations. Helping to provide safety nets for these
gronps is necessary not only from an equity perspective, but also to maintain
socioeconomic stability, and arrest environmental degradation.

In 1996, Bank-approved loans with social dimensions as the primary
or secondary objective totaled $1,718 million. Of this, $557.2 million had
poverty reduction as a ptimary or secondary objective, $1,236 million had
human development as a primary or secondary objective, and $108 million
had women in development (WID) as a primary or secondary objective.
Newer and more effecrive approaches were employed to maximize the social
development impact of these projects.

During the year, investment in human resources was an important parr
of the Bank’s social development program. For example, the Basic Health
Services Project in Cambodia is expected to benefit some 3.9 million people
through strengthening community health services. At the same time, the
Bank did not confine its social concerns to development initiatives through

119ANNUAL REPORT 1996

 

 

 

 

socially oriented projects. It also incorporated social development concerns
in conventional projects, such as the Second Tourism Development and the
Kali Gandaki “A” Hydroelectric Power projects m Nepal, respectively, through
community-based poverty reduction and environmental upgtading activities, and participatory approaches to resettlement and compensation issues.
articipatory approaches to the maintenance of irrigation infrastructure are
an important element of the Agriculture Sector Program in Cambodia.
Other means of incorporating social dimensions in projects include using
ocal communities to construct, operate, and maintain small village
infrastructure and watercourses; and using participatory development processes
and NGOs to identify beneficiary needs and to implement communitybuilding project components for microfinance schemes.

WID is a central objective of the Bank’s development initiatives. Many
projects approved during 1996, such as the Basic Education Textbook and
Basic Health Services projects in Cambodia; the Basic Education and Family
Health and Nutrition projects in Indonesia; and the North Central Province
Rural Development Project in Sri Lanka, are substantially targeted to improve
women’s health and educational opportunities, or have substantial components to facilitate the inclusion of WID processes. In particular, the Family
Health and Nutrition Project in Indonesia will focus on maternal and
neonatal health problems, and long-term contraceptive use. The latter
employs a “family apptoach,” taking into account complex interactions
between individuals and their families,

Besides projects, WID strategies and briefing papers were prepared for
Kazakstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Malaysia. During 1996, WID Country
Briefing Papers were published for Cambodia, Kiribati, and Lao PDR, and
papers for Kazakstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Malaysia are being finalized for
publication in 1997. The proceedings of a seminar on WID at the Bank’s
28th Annual Meeting, Towards Beijing...Beyond Beijing, was also published
in 1996. A video on women in Asia, particularly in Bangladesh, Cambodia,
and Philippines, entitled A Voice of Her Own, was produced in 1996.

Three WID-oriented regional technical assistance projects, Sociolega!
Status of Women in Selected DMCs, Low-Income Women Entrepreneurs
in Asia, and Global Summit of Women: Women’s Economic Power were
approved during 1996 and are currently being implemented.

Involuntary resettlement is an important social concern of the Bank.
While a review of the implementation of the Bank's Involuntary
Resettlement Policy is being undertaken, it bas published the
comprehensive Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice for
carrying out its policy more systematically. Complying with the Bank's
involuntary resettlement policy, project planners are increasingly examining
alternatives to minimize or eliminate the need for land acquisition and
resettlement. Some transport projects have changed route alignments,
such as the Second Road Improvement Project in Viet Nam, or have
adjusted standards used in rural towns where land and population pressures are most intense. Surveys and censuses are increasingly being used
to identify persons affected by projects. Some projects have developed
comprehensive procedutes for consultation with persons affected and, if
needed, for grievance redress. These include the Jamuna Bridge Access
Roads Project in Bangladesh, which draws on and strengthens consultative and participatory processes, such as using local-level resettlementOPERATIONS

workers, public meetings, focus groups, and a grievance-redress committee
involving NGOs, as well as special measures, to compensate and restore the
livelihoods of squattets. The Kali Gandaki “A” Hydroelectric Power Project
in Nepal used regular newspaper reports, meetings with NGOs and affected
persons, and public information centers in Kathmandu in a comprehensive
public consultation program.

Through its technical assistance operations, the Bank continues ro
build its own capacity and that of its DMCs to implement socially oriented
projects, and to carry out accurate social assessments for conventional
projects. Twelve regional technical assistance projects addressing socioeconomic
and sociocultural issues were at different stages of implementation during
1996. Also during the year, the Bank approved two regional technical
assistance grants focusing on social issues: A Study of NGOs in Asian DMCs
(Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines,
Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam), and Facilitating Capacity Building and Participation Activities. In addition, a regional technical assistance on involuntary
resettlement issues, which will assess the potential for capacity building,
country policies, laws, strategies, and practices, and recommend operational
guidelines and training programs for implementing agencies, was proposed.

The Bank’s social development specialists continued to coordinate with
projects departments staff in designing projects which maximize social benefits.
Strengthening social sector analysis in country strategy, programming work,
and lending operations is an ongoing Bank goal. In November 1996, a
Roundtable Meeting on the Sociocultural Aspects of Economic Development in Pacific DMCs was held in Fijiin cooperation with the Bank’s Office
of Pacific Operations.

Also in 1996, training programs on incorporating social development
in Bank projects were undertaken by Bank staff and DMC agencies. Three
new publications were released during the year: Sociocultural Isswes and
Economic Development in the Pacific, Mainstreaming Participatory Development
Processes, and Towards Beijing...Beyond Begjing.

Active collaboration, covering the range of social issues that concern the
Bank, was maintained with various international organizations, including ESCAP,
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), International Labour Organisation
(ILO), Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), UNDP, UN High
Commission on Refugees (UNHCR), UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), UN
Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), and World Bank.

Asamemher of the Consultative Group to Assisr the Poorest (CGAP),
a multidonor effort to address poverty reduction through microfinance, the
Bank participated in two CGAP meetings held in 1996. The Bank is a
member of CGAP’s Policy Advisory Group, and participates in consultations
to discuss poverty measurement tools. Preparations for the Fourth CGAP
Consultative Forum, which will be hosted by the Bank in 1997, were
initiated in 1996.

The Bank was also represented at the Donors’ Meeting of the Interagency
Working Group on Participation held in Washington, DC, duting March;
at the ESCAP Regional Meeting to discuss “Strengthening National
Machineries for the Advancement of Women for Implementation of the
Beijing Platform for Action” held in Seoul, Republic of Korea, during
September; and at the Bank Poor ’96 Regional Workshop held in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, during December.

Private Sector Activities

The Bank’s private sector operations are intended to help selected private
enterprises undertake financially viable projects which have significant
economic merit. The Bank provides assistance in the form of loans without
government guarantee and equity investments, and helps mobilize domestic
and external resources. The growing emphasis placed by DMCs on the role
of the private sector in economic development makes direct support for
private enterprise a priority for the Bank. At the same time, through policy
dialogue, technical assistance, and program lending, the Bank continues to
contribute to the creation of a conducive environment for private sector
development in DMCs.

The current strategy for the Bank’s private sector operations is designed
to optimize the benefits of Bank resources alloted to these operations. It calls
for (i) focusing support on projects for financial intermediarion, capital
market, or infrastructure development, with industry sector projects being
given lower priority; {ii} raking into account the differing circumstances and
needs of host DMCs, and the Bank’s overall operational strategy for each
country; and (iii) leveraging the Bank’s own funds to mobilize a larger flow
of private funds into DMCs.

During 1996, the Bank approved ten ptivate sector projects involving
commitments of $263.3 million, of which $156 million are in loans without
government guarantee and $107.3 million in equity investments. For details,
see Table 16 in the Statistical Annex. In line with the strategy of leveraging
the Bank’s own funds, the 1996 projects involve investments and investible
funds totaling $2.6 billion, in addition to the amount coming from the Bank.
This indicates that for every $1 invested by the Bank, an additional $10 are
mobilized from other investors and Jenders.

Of the ten private sector projects, three were infrastructure projects
being underraken on a build-operate-own/build-operate-transfer (BOO/BOT)
basis: a 500MW coal-fired power project in India, a 6(0MW hydropower
project in Nepal, and a [50MW gas-fired power plant in Pakistan. These
three power-generation projects accounted for 45% of the total amount of
funds committed by the Bank to the ten approved projects, and 89% of
complementary loans provided by other lenders. The relatively substantial
commitments to the three power projects reflect the priority accorded by
the Bank to help meet the DMCs’ massive infrastructure development need.
As is well known, governments concerned, squeezed between tightening
budgets and competing high-priority expenditures, cannot keep pace with
the ever-rising development demand. In addition, the Bank recognizes the
benefits tbar the private sector can derive from expanded and improved
infrastructure facilities and the catalytic role it can play. This catalytic role
has a great beneficial impact in countries where the private sector is unable
to mobilize needed iuvestment funds from local or offshore financial narkets
because of imperfections in the local capital markets, and external perceptions
of the country risk involved. In these DMCs, the Bank’s participation can
enhance the sponsors’ ability to secure other needed resources. The loans
approved by the Bank in 1996 for power projects, for instance, provided the
catalytic effect in attracting needed cofinancing.

Domestic financial intermediaries are important in mobilizing resources
for economic development, and institutional enhancement of theseOPERATIONS

intermediaries helps strengthen the financial infrastructure in DMCs concerned.
Assistance to individual intermediaries also helps promote the Bank's policy
work in the financial sector. Bank assistance is provicled in accordance with
the stage of development of the financial sector in the host country. The
impact of such assistance is particularly significant in transition economies.
Fort instance, the equity investment approved for one of the first three
easing companies to be licensed in Viet Nam will help diversify the financial
sector of the country. Another equity investment was approved for Everbright
Bank of China (EBBC), one of the PRC’s six commercial banks with a
nationwide presence. The investment in EBBC represents the first foreign
investment in a local state-owned commercial bank. It supports EBBC’s
strategic plan to transform itself into a shareholding bank grounded on “best
practices” principles.

Under its private sector operations, the Bank helps transfer scarce long
term risk capital from capital-rich countries to DMCs for private sector
development. This is done through the promotion of offshore investment
unds, as well as domestic mutual funds. Such funds help stimulate and
broaden emerging securities markets, and function as proxies for overseas
investors wanting to invest in DMC portfolios. Duting 1996, equity investments in two regional funds and one domestic mutual fund were approved
by the Bank. The Asian Private Investment Company Limited (APIC) is a
regional fund that will tap the huge amounts of investible saving from pension
funds in North America and other countries. APIC will invest in inftastructure, industry, and financial services. The other regional fund is the Asian
nfrastructure Mezzanine Capital Fund (AMF), which will mobilize funds
rom international insurance companies. AMF will introduce “mezzanine”
inancing (which is halfway between tisk equity and secured debt) to the
region, particularly for infrastructure development. The domestic mutual
und supported by the Bank is The Mutual Fund Company of the Philippines,
which will mobilize small savings for investment in the domestic securities
market, and offer an alternative to time deposits in banks.
Assistance to industry sector projects is provided by the Bank on a
highly selective basis. Duting 19946, the Bank approved two industry sector
projects: an oleochemical complex in Indonesia, and a cement plant in Viet
Nam. The Indonesian project is an export-oriented agro-industrial enterprise
that supports the development of a less-developed region in the country.
The cement project in Viet Nam is so far the largest private sector involvement ina state-controlled industry. It is the biggest private sector project
outside the energy sector, and represents the Bank's first ptivate sector loan
in Viet Nam. The project will support ongoing reforms to reduce the
Government’s control over the cement industry. Both projects involve foreign
partnets providing technology inputs.

 

Cofinancing and Guarantee Operations

The Bank’s cofinancing operations gathered momentum under the new
cofinancing and guarantee policy approved in 1995. The policy effectively
supports the Bank’s emphasis on resource mobilization and catalytic investment strategy. The main objectives of the cofinancing sttategy are, to (i) play
a catalytic role in bringing additional private resource flows to DMCs by
assisting cofinanciers in the appraisal and management of tisks; and

(ii) continue the promotion of official cofinancing, with special emphasis on
low-income countries. Implementation of the strategy also calls for the
mainstreaming of cofinancing activities into Bank operations. Under the
new guarantee. policy, the Bank can provide credit guarantee, where it
provides all-inclusive cover for a portion of the debt service, or a risk
guarantee, where it covers specific risk events for all (or part) of the debt
service. During 1996, commercial cofinancing was mobilized without the use
of either credit or risk guarantee by the Bank.

In 1996, cofinancing mobilized from all sources amounted to $2,695.2 million. This represented a 9% increase over $2,480.6 million achieved in the
previous year, and was equivalent to 49% of the Bank’s total lending of
$5,545 million committed during the year. In other words, for every dollar
of Bank foan, an additional 49 cenrs were mobilized through cofinancing.
Cofinancing came from official, export credit, and commercial sources.
For details, see Table 15 in the Statistical Annex.

A total of 13 DMCs received cofinancing in 1996 with Pakistan as the
top recipient, accounting for 53% of the total, followed by Nepal with 9%,
Philippines with 8%, and Indonesia with 7%.

During the period 1970-1996, the cumulative total of coftnancing
amounted to $24.6 billion. Of this total, the energy sector had the largest
share, amounting to $12.6 billion or 51%, followed by transport and
communications, $3.9 billion or 16%, and agriculture and natural resources,
$3.5 billion or 14%. Large infrastructure projects have generally attracted
cofinancing more often than other projects.

Official Cofinancing

Official cofinancing reached a new high of $2,384.9 million, a slight increase
of 5% over the previous year’s record of $2,265 million, and accounted for
88% of total cofinancing mobilized during 1996. The share of bilateral
sources amounted to 56% or $1,347 million, while the share of multilateral
sources amounted to 44% or $1,038 million. Because of the nature of official
development assistance (ODA), most official cofinancing was provided
in the form of concessional loans and grants, largely from bilateral
sources. Bilateral cofinancing support was received from nine countries:
Australia, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Kuwait, Netherlands, Norway,
Switzerland, and United Kingdom. Japan continued to be the largest
source of official cofinancing. It cofinanced 10 projects for a total of
$1,034 million, of which $764 million came from OECF, $260 million
from the Export-Import Bank of Japan, and $10 million from the Japan
International Cooperation Agency.

in addition, the Bank actively pursued cofinancing for technical assistance with official donors. This included voluntary contributions to the
Bank's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF), annual contributions to
the Japan Special Fund (JSF), and untied grants from bilateral sources. The
mode of cofinancing used was normally exclusive or joint-financing
arrangements. Donors from bilateral sources included the governments of
Australia, Denmark, Finland, France, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and
Switzerland. For details, see Grant-Financed Technical Assistance from Other
Sources, 1996. During 1996, untied grants from bilareral sources, where the
Bank acted as the grant administrator, amounted to $36.3 million inclusiveOPERATIONS

of grant assistance from the Netherlands and Switzerland, to finance soft
components included in Bank-assisted loans.

The Government of Japan made its ninth year contribution to JSF,
amounting to ¥9.03 billion ($79.9 million equivalent} in untied grant assistance. A total of $79.9 million for 122 technical assistance projects was
sourced from JSF in 1996.

During 1996, the Bank and the United Nations Industrial Development
Organisation (UNIDO) signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Working Arrangements to strengthen cooperation between the two organizations
in the service of DMCs of common membership. The Government of Belgium
also made available to the Bank an initial contribution in Belgian francs
(BF) 30 million ($960,000 equivalent) to finance, on an untied grant basis,
technical assistance projects under the Channel Financing arrangement
administered by the Bank.

Commercial Cofinancing

Cofinancing from market sources amounted to $220.5 million for three
projects.’ The volume of commercial cofinancing depends largely on the size
and number of bankable projects identified, as well as the timing of financial
closing. The 1996 result for commercial cofinancing was slightly higher than
the $215.5 million achieved in 1995. The Complementary Financing Scheme
(CFS) and parallel loan modalities were used for the cofinancing arrangements during the year. Two CFS loans in the private sector totaling
$80.5 million were arranged, while a 15-year parallel loan for $100 million
was successfully concluded without credit enhancement by the Bank for a
public sector power project in the PRC. Cofinancing from market sources
is expected to increase significantly in 1997 as a result of continued Bankwide
efforts co seek cofinancing from market sources, and the identification of
an increased number of projects in the pipeline, including those that were
slipped in processing from 1996.

Export Credit Cofinancing

In response to the need to cooperate with export credit agencies (ECAs), the
cofinancing strategy requires the Bank to take proactive measures in promoting
export credit cofinancing for public sector projects. In 1996, the Bank cooperated
closely with two ECAs in arranging export credit financing for two BOO/BOT
projects on a project financing basis. A total of $89.8 million of ECA cofinancing
was arranged for three private sector power projects.

Bank’s Role in Resource Transfer

The net transfer of resources (defined as disbursements less principal repayments and prepayments, payments of interest and other charges plus net
equity investments) from the Bank to DMCs decreased from $794 million
in 1995 to $34 million in 1996. This meant a decrease of 96%, compared

cofinancing, where records are based on the commitments of the cofinanciers.

Of the total net transfer, a negative $943 million was from OCR and
a positive $977 million from ADF. The net transfer from OCR was negative
mainly because of prepayments by India, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, and
Thailand, which amounted to $1,404 million.

Loan disbursements amounted to $3,797 million. The amount exceeded
the year’s target by 2.4%. There was an increase in disbursements from both
OCR (5%) and ADF (7%) resources, compared with last year.

The disbursement ratio (including program loans), defined as the ratio
of disbursement during the year over the undisbursed net loan balance at

Bank’s Determined Efforts in Resource Mobilization

COFINANCING continues to play a vital
tale in supporting the Bank’s catalytic lending strategy. In the energy sector alone, the
Bank has generated total cofinancing of
$1,517 million in 1996, in addition to its own
lending through both public and private sector windows. The Bank's active involvement
in cofinancing arrangements has enabled
Bank-assisted projects to obtain the best
possible financing terms.

Cofinancing arrangements have contributed to the suce
projects. For example, the $170 million private sector Fauji Kabirwala Power Co. Ltd.
project in Pakistan could not have been funded

s of various Bank

 

without che significant Bank-arranged market cofinancing. Aside from a loan ($32 million) and an equity investment ($5.3 mil
lion), an additional $61 million were mobilized
through the Bank's Complementary Financing Scheme, which is in the form of a 12-year
term loan from a syndicate of international
commercial banks. The project promotes a
public/private partnership that will help
Pakistan encourage privare sector participation in an area char has, until recently, been
dominated by the public sector. Moreover,
the project's debt financing as well as equity
financing are expected to (i) encourage longterm investments from foreign and local investors in Pakistan's power sector; and (ii) help

assuage the country’s critical power shortage.

Another project tor which cofinancin
trom various sources featured highly is a mega
project in Pakistan — the Ghazi Baroth
Hydropower Project with a total cost ol
$2,200 million. A total of $947 million
cofinancing has been attracted from the
International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, OECF of Japan, Kreditanstal:
fiir Wiederautbau (Ki), the European
Investment Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank. The Bank provided a loan of
$300 million and a technical assistance grant
of 3850,000 cofinanced by the Bank ($250,000)
with the Government of France ($600,000).
The technical assistance is aimed ar formulating the power efficiency mechanism ro

Law and Development

As part of its efforts to support capacity building and good governance for
sound development management, the Bank continued to expand law and
development work in 1996, promoting policies, legal reforms, and regulations supporting economic growth; enhancing the starus of women; and
protecting the environment. Such wock has focused on capacity building
among institutions responsible for the administration and enforcement of
laws and regularions, continuing legal education for government lawyers
working with frontline development ministries and with government enterprises, and fostering research into the relationships becween economic development and legal reforms.

During 1996, the Bank approved 46 law-related technical assistance
projects in 16 DMCs dealing with a wide range of sectors, including modernization of land administration in Bangladesh, strengthening environmenral impact assessment capabilities and preparation of environmental regulations
in Bhutan, developing capacity in audit and inspectorate functions in
Cambodia, capacity building for natural resoutce legislation in the PRC,
corporatizing Fiji’s water and sewerage sector, restructuring India’s stateowned enterprises in Gujarat, establishing a gas regulatory framework in
Indonesia, strengthening social service delivery and finance in Kazakstan,
building capacity for the formation and management of water users’
associations in the Kyrgyz Republic, developing a regulatory framework
for the Credit and Bank Supervision Section of the Maldives Monetary
Authotity, evaluating environmenral standards for selected industry
subsectors in the Philippines, and capacity building at the State AuditorGeneral's Office in Viet Nam.

Among these law and development projects, the Bank financed five
regional technical assisrance projects. These dealt with the sociolegal stacus
of women, a feasibility study for an Internet legal resource center, mitigation
of nonphysical barriers to cross-border movement of goods and people,
developing a Greater Mekong Subregion east-west transport corridor, and
an ADB/World Trade Organization workshop concerning antidumping and
countervailing duty laws and regulations.

In some cases, legislation was enacted, incorporating revisions prepared
under Bank-financed technical assistance. For example, in May 1996, the
PRC's National People’s Congress amended the 1984 Water Pollution Law,
following assistance ro the staff of the Environmental Protection Committee
of the National People’s Congress under a Bank technical assistance. The
Bank’s Telecommunications Project in Mongolia and related technical assistance for relecommunications sector reform resulted in the enactment of
its Telecommunications Law in January 1996, and implementation of its
subordinate regnlatory framework.

Tbe Bank is also snpporting a comparative stndy of the relationships
between economic growth and legal reforms in the region. Under a Bankfinanced regional technical assistance on The Role of Law and Legal Institutions

Economic Research

The Bank engages in and facilitates research, training, and exchange and
dissemination of information through publications, conferences, workshops,
and symposia. While research is primarily done at the Economics and
Developrnent Resource Center (EDRC), the Asian Development Bank Institute
(ADBI), the establishment of which was approved in 1996, will also have
a research component, focusing on themes or issues critical for long-term,
broad-based, and sustainable development.

The main role of EDRC is to undertake and promote research on key
development issues, and strengthen analytical awareness on matters of economic relevance to Bank operations. This primarily translates into
(i) undertaking research and analysis on development policy issues and
disseminating the findings for the use of DMCs; (ii) providing operational
support by teviewing the quality of project evaluation and sector work;
(iii) providing information and advice to Management and the rest of the
Bank on economic events, studies, and policy debates in the field of development; (iv) providing statistical assistance to DMCs and other parts of the
Bank; and (v)} providing resource center activities.

In 1996, a major regional technical assistance for a Study on Emerging
Asia was implemented. The study reviews the progress achieved in Asia so
far, and attempts to identify future major development trends. Other topics
under study during the year included social sector issues in Asian transition
economies, the global trading environment, financial flows and policy issues,
and regional economic cooperation. Major components of rhe Brunei
Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippmes East ASEAN Growth Area Study
were completed during the year.

Conferences and seminars were held on various economic issues. These
included a panel seminar on Globalization and the Impact on Asia held
at the 29th Annual Meeting of the ADB Board of Governors and the
Ninch Asian Economic Outlook Workshop which examined Export
Performance in the Asian and Pacific region. A conference on Investing
in Asia was held jointly with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development in Paris.

In the atea of project quality improvement, several measures were
undertaken to enhance the economic analysis of projects prior to loan
approval. A new version of the Bank's Guidelines for Economic Analysis of
Projects, to replace that issued in 1987, was finalized. Two technical
assistance projects were continued: Economic Evaluation Methodology
in Water Supply Projects and Economic Analysis of Build-‘Own-OperateTransfer (BOOT) Projects. The Guidelines for Economic Analysis of
Telecommunications Projects was completed and work began on the Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Urban Development Projects, Benefit
Measurements for Rural Electrification, and the Best Practice Case Studies
for Power Projects. A Board information paper on Bank criteria for subsidies
was also completed and circulated. Workshops for Bank staff on economic
analysis of projects were held.OPERATIONS

Statistical data collection is an important part of the Bank’s assistance
to DMCs. During the year, the Bank remained active in the capacity
building of DMCs’ statistical systems and services through the provision
of technical assistance. The Bank also continued to improve its statistical database system in terms of data coverage, and to upgrade its
facilities to provide better service in support of Bank operations as well
as external users. A Statistics and Data Systems Division (EDSD) Home
Page was developed to provide staff and external users access to statistical
data comparable with those found in the Bank’s Key Indicators of Developing
Asian and Pacific Countries.

As part of its efforrs to strengthen institutions and human development
in DMCs, the Bank continued to produce and distribute numerous publications, including the Asian Development Outlook, Asian Development Review,
and Key Indicators of Developing Asian and Pacific Countries. The Bank
conducted training programs on taxation and financial policies for policymakers.
Training workshops in the economic analysis of projects for DMCs were
developed for implementation in 1997. The Bank also supported other
organizations such as the Asian Productivity Organization and the Colombo
Plan in their training programs. The Bank served as a resource center on
Asian economic issues for many external organizations from both the public
and private sectors.

PY HE BANR’S country-based approach to development offers borrowing

developing member countries (DMCs) an integrated package of services,
which links project financing with policy review, capacity building, and
regional cooperation. To ensure a DMC’s goals are met, the Bank conducts
a study of the country’s economic situation and its development plans and
priorities. Based on this study, the Bank prepares a country operational
strategy — in consultation with the government concerned — followed by the
preparation of a country assistance plan. The plan scrutinizes the role of
each project with respect ro the country's development program and the
Bank's strategy. The Bank also conducts yearly country programming missions
to consult with the DMC government on its operational strategy and programs. The operational strategy and policy dialogue are presented for each
borrowing DMC in this chapter. Strategies for some DMCs are being
ormulated, while strategies for other countries are being revised to meet
changed economic and social circumstances.
In addition, this chapter highlights the 1996 lending and technical
assistance activities, as well as project implementation in each bortowing
DMC. Major indicators of portfolio performance are given as the number
of loans approved at rhe end of the year, the cumulative number of closed
loans, and the number of loans under administration. The amount of contracts
awarded, the amount of loans disbursed during the year, and the relevant
cumulative amounts are also provided. Disbursement and contract award
ratios are given for each country.' Major implementation issues encountered
by the Bank are highlighted for each country.

Bangladesh

Operational Strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for Bangladesh focuses
on poverty reduction. Ways to create economic opportunities for the poor
and improve their access to basic social services through equitable and
sustainable growth are being emphasized. A significant component of the
Bank's operations in the country in support of economic growth is human
development, particularly of women, through education, and the provision
of employment and income opportunities. The Bank pays attention to
protecting and improving the environment, promoting broad-based and

equitable economic growth through greatet market orientation and support,
and enhancing private sector participation. Policies and projects that promote the productive and sustainable use of labor will be adopted to make
growth more equitable.

Policy Dialogue: During the year, the major focus of the policy dialogue
was On promoting private sector investment in power generation, and
restructuring the power sector. The main objectives of this exercise were to
introduce corporate managemenr of utilities and improve managerial
accountability of each facet of the generation, transmission, and distribution
process. Institutional and legislative reforms were encouraged in the forestry
sector to streamline policies and procedures for people-oriented forestry
programs, and promote participatory forestation for sustainable development and management of forest resources. Dialogue for further improving
the efficiency and accountability of Bangladesh Railways through institutional and organizational reforms was continued. The Bank also provided
further assistance to modernize and reform the country’s land administration and taxation system to establish efficient property markets, promote
timely development-related land acquisition, and increase resource
mobilization.

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1996, the Bank provided three
loans amounting to $256.4 million to Bangladesh. The loans were for projects
in the transport (roads), energy, and forestry sectors. The Bank also approved
14 technical assistance grants totaling $16.3 million, of which $1.7 million
were for project preparation. Two of the approved technical assistance
grants, totaling $10.6 million, wete exclusively financed by Switzerland and
the Netherlands.

Project Implementation: Of the 123 loans approved as of end-1996,
83 had been closed and 40 were under administration. Contracts worth
$227.6 million were awarded during the year, bringing the cumulative total
of contracts to $3,387.8 million. The contract award tatio for 1996 was
18.8%. Disbursements for the year totaled $301.4 million, bringing cumulative disbursements to $3,490.8 million. The. disbursement ratio for 1996
was 24.9%. The Bangladesh Resident Mission assisted the Government in
coordinating and monitoring Bank projects and programs, as well as in
dialogue on policy issues. A portfolio performance review was undertaken
to deal with issues concerning project implementation and quality. A country
progtamming mission was conducted to confirm the 1997 lending program.

Bhutan

Operational Strategy: The Bank is assisting Bhutan in its efforts to move
toward a more diversified economy. The assistance enhances the country’s
capacity to earn foreign exchange and develops its capacity for macroeconomic
management. Lending is focused on infrastructure projects such as power,
transport (roads), and urban infrastructure. Financial sectot improvement
and environmental protection are also emphasized. Technical assistance will
continue to be focused on a broader range of sectors where capacity building
is required, including agriculture, physical infrastructure, and social
infrastcucture.

activities, private sector development has been constrained by lack of
infrastructure, a small base of entrepreneurs, and labor shortages. The
Government continued to aim at financing all its recurrent expenditures
from domestic resources, and its development expenditures from external
grants and soft loans. To increase revenues, the need to broaden the base
for tax revenues, introduce user fees, and improve cost recovery were
emphasized. These efforts will need to be closely monitored to prevent
further dererioration in the fiscal situation.

Loans and Technical Assistance: No loans were approved in 1996.
Four technical assistance grants, totaling $1.44 million, were approved.

Project Implementation: Of the [1 loans approved as of end- 1996,
eight had been closed and three were under implementation. Contracts
amounting to $5.7 million were awarded during 1996, bringing the cumulative total to $38.6 million. The contract award ratio for 1996 was 49.5%.
Disbursements during the year amounted to $2.8 million, bringing cumulative disbursements to $33.7 million, The disbursement ratio for 1996 was
5.8%. The Government's monitoring of project implementation and other
related positive initiatives in addressing project implementation constraints
have resulted in improved contract awards and disbursements. However,
project implementation continues to be impeded by a shortage of skilled
labor, delayed establishment of project offices, and high turnover of project
implementation staff.

Cambodia

Operational Strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy in Cambodia is to
build capacity by (i} strengthening sector institutions; (ii) supporting GDP
growth by fostering the transition to a market economy, and rehabilitating
the country’s physical and social infrastructure; (iii) improving the access
of the poor to employment opportunities; and (iv) improving and protecting
the environment. The Bank focuses on poverty reduction by enhancing GDP
growth, and by designing projects and programs which benefit the poor, particularly in rural areas. Supporting the Government’s development thrust in its
transition toa market economy, developing human resources, and ensuring
sound natural resource management are other major areas of attention.

Policy Dialogue: In light of Cambodia’s transition from a centrally
planned to a market-oriented economy, discussions between the Bank and
the Government in 1996 continued to focus on macroeconomic management, medium-term economic planning, investment programming, and
strengthening of government institutions and the legal framework. Agriculture sector reform was an important agenda among the sectoral policies. The
Bank also assisred rhe Government in developing sound management practices by preparing guidelines on public procurement and establishing an
independent audit office.

Loans and Technical Assistance: There were five loans totaling
$105 million and 16 technical assistance apptovals for $9.4 million in 1996.

Project Implementation: Ten loans totaling $247.7 million had been
approved as of end-1996. Nine loans are currently under administration.

disbursements totaling $86 million. The disbursement ratio for 1996 wags
20.4%. As the country is in the midst of its transition to a market
economy, institutional, financial, and human resource constraints were
encountered in project implementation. As of end-1996, the Bank has
provided substantial technical assistance, amounting to about $39 million,
including cofinancing of about $10 million from other sources. Over
50% of the technical assistance is focused on capacity building and
institutional development.

People’s Republic of China

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational strategy in the People’s Republic
of China was updated in 1996, taking into account the country’s significant
socioeconomic transformation during the last 17 years, and its development
priorities for 1996-2000. The revised operational strategy emphasizes three
broad objectives: (i) improving economic efficiency; (ii) promoting economic
growth to reduce poverty in the inland provinces; and (iii) enhancing
environmental protection and natural resource management. The main
operational tbrusts of the strategy include (i) a shift of Bank assistance to
projects in the interior provinces; (ii) provision of policy support for the
economic reform program, including fiscal, financial, and enterprise
reforms; (iii) capacity-building support focused on macroeconomic management, environmental management, capital market development, and improving the legal and regulatory framework; and (iv) promotion of private
sector participation and cofinancing activities to help meet the large financing requirements, particularly in infrastructure development. The Bank fully
supports the Government’s objectives of preserving social stability and
maintaining public support for the continued implementation of marketbased reforms.

Policy Dialogue: Continuing policy discussions between the Bank and
the Government focused on the need to deepen monetary, fiscal, financial,
and enterprise reforms to support the development of a socialist market
economy. Because of the large financing requirements of the counrry’s
modernization program, the Bank also stressed the need to promote
private sector participation and alternative methods of financing —
including build-operate-transfer (BOT) and build-operate-own (BOO)
schemes — for infrastructure development in the transport, communications, power, and warer supply sectors. Another important topic of
discussion centered on the need to mobilize domestic resources through
the development of capital markets. In this regard, the Bank is support
ing a domestic mutual fund industry through a series of policy-based .

technical assistance grants, Policy dialogue has also been focused on
completing the fiscal reform program embarked on by the authorities in
1992. A cluster of advisory technical assistance projects relating to
various aspects of public finance and budget management is contained
in the operational program. Other policy issues discussed with the
Government include (i) adoption of appropriate energy pricing to promote energy conservation and environmental prorection; (ii) the need
to increase investment in agriculture and rural development to help
reduce poverty; (iii) adoption of commercial banking practices;
(iv) development of a legal and regulatory framework to support the transitionCOUNTRY HIGHLIGHTS

the involvement of nongovernmental organizations
in project preparation and

rural areas. In the agriculture and natural resource sector, policy discussions
continued to emphasize the need for the development of basic rural
infrastructure, including farm-to-market roads and related support services
such as credit, extension, and marketing services. Dialogue continued also
on the management and protection of natural resources, particularly on the
fisheries sector, the critical importance of coastal zone management, and
on the use of a community-based approach to project management in the
forestry sector. In the power, water supply, and road sectors, policy dialogue
centered on good governance with special focus on issues relating to pricing
and cost recovery, Operation and maintenance, and rhe privatization of
publicly provided services, where feasible. In the health and education
sectors, policy dialogue centered on the devolution of functions to local
governments, and the need for further organizational streamlining and institution-building to improve service delivery at the local level. The operational implications of the Official Development Assistance (ODA) Act of
1996 were also reviewed with the Government.

Sri Lanka

Operational Strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for Sri Lanka aims
to reduce poverty and unemploymenr through supporting measures, which
would raise the level of economic performance and efficiency. The strategy
aims to (i) promote sound macroeconomic policies to improve domestic
resource mobilization; (ii) improve the capacity and efficiency of the public
sector; (iii) provide adequate basic infrastructure to avoid bottlenecks to
balanced national development; and (iv) ensure an appropriate matching
of labor force skills to meet market requirements. Efficiency gains are expected
to emerge through supporting public sector reforms and increasing the scope
for private sector participation in the economy.

Policy Dialogue: Advisory technical assistance to improve public sector
efficiency was the principal focus of policy dialogue in 1996. The Bank
assisted the Government in examining ways to streamline the public administration system. Bank assistance was also provided to review the Government's
contract and procurement procedures to remove bottlenecks for the effective
and rimely implementation of development projects. Policy discussions were
also continued in 1996 in the water sector, with emphasis on strengthening
institutional arrangements to improve water sector management and
sustainability.

Loans and Technical Assistance: Two loans ainounting to $44 million
were approved during the year in the energy ($24 million) and agricultureCOUNTRY HIGHLIGHTS

($20 million) sectors. The Bank also approved seven technical assistance
grants amounting to about $2.6 million.

Project Implementation: Of the 78 loans approved as of end-1996,
54 had been closed and 24 were under administration, including one yet
to become effective, Contract awards during the year amounted to $112.4 million, bringing the cumulative total to $1,290.7 million. The contract award
ratio for 1996 was 16.4%. Disbursements during the year amounted to
$149 million, with cumulative disbursements reaching $1,277.1 million. The
disbursement ratio for 1996 was 24.2%. A project performance review,
undertaken during the year, helped identify several key issues concerning
project implementation, and the Government pledged its continuous efforts
ro address those issues. A projecr implementation and management seminar
was also held to familiarize executing agency staff with the Bank’s procedures and requirements.

Thailand

Operational Strategy: The objectives of the Bank's operational strategy for
Thailand are to sustain its long-term competitiveness in the face of an
increasingly complex domestic and external environment, and achieve a
more equitable distribution of the benefits of economic growth. To attain
these objectives, the Bank focuses its efforts on (i) supporting the upgrading
of physical infrastructure, with special emphasis on lagging regions and
associated policy and institutional reforms including privatization and
greater private sector participation; (ii) developing human resources
with a focus on emerging constraints involving shortages and mismatched
skills and an inadequate science and technology base; and (iii) managing
the environment and natural resources in terms of conserving long-term
potential and appropriate utilization for economic activities. A notable
feature of the Bank’s approach is its effort to link economic activities in lessdeveloped regions of the country to those in neighboring countries in the
context of subregional economic cooperation.

=a Policy Dialogue: A
vital component of the
mS Bank's operations in Viet

Nam is support for policy
and structural reforms to
improve public sector efficiency, and to encourage theCOUNTRY HIGHLIGHTS

development of the private sector. Dialogue included support for increased efficiency through tariff reform and other measures to increase
cost recovery and strengthen financial management, policy analysis, and
planning within state-owned utilities. Policy dialogue also plays an important role in improving natural resource management and environmental
protection. To facilitate policy dialogue, advisory technical assistance was
provided to key government agencies that formulate and implement policy
reforms. A technical assistance to support public administration reforms
through the Committee on Government Organization and Personnel was
approved.

Loans and Technical Assistance: The Bank approved five loans totaling $333 million for the agriculture, social infrastructure, transport, and
financial sectors, and one loan to a ptivate sector corporation in the industry
sector. The Bank's policy-based loan to support the Government's proposed
Financial Sector Program was approved. Another policy-based loan in the
industry sector is included in the medium-term program. Fifteen technical
assistance grants totaling $10.1 million were also approved, six of which
were for project preparation.

Project Implementation: Of the 25 loans approved as of end-1996,

$28.7 million, with cumulative dishursements reaching $105.4 million. The
disbursement ratio for 1996 was 4.8%. Viet Nam has been experiencing
project implementation difficulties due to centralized decision-making procedures, lack of counterpart funds, and lack of standardized procurement
procedures. The Bank has engaged the Government in policy dialogue and
also provided technical assistance for resolving these issues.

Western Samoa

Operational Strategy: The Bank supports ways to promote the private
sector, improve basic infrastructure, strengthen institutional capabilities,

management. Its aim is to assist Western Samoa in effectitig structural
changes in the productive sectors of the economy.

Policy Dialogue: Topics discussed pertained to policy reforms and
institutional changes to stimulate and sustain economic growth. The need
to ensure a financially sustainable level of investment and adopt a private
sector-led economic strategy was stressed. Implementation of the Privatization
Strategy and Privatization Master Plan and measures to liberalize the financial sector were encouraged.

Loans and Technical Assistance: No loans were made in 1996. Two
technical assistance grants totaling $700,000 were approved, one of which
was for project preparation.

|=Ordinary Capital
Resources and
Financial Management

HE BANK’S ordinary capital resources (OCR) comprise subscribed

capital, reserves and surplus, and funds raised through borrowings. At
the end of 1996, loans from OCR accounted for 70% of cumulative Bank
lending. The effective and efficient management of OCR is governed by five
key sets of financial policies: capital resource management policies, borrowing policies and strategies, net income management policies, liquidity policy,
and loan products and credit risk policies. Tbis chapter examines the OCR,
the performance and allocation of net income, loan products, and the
Bank’s borrowing and liability management strategy.

Fourth General Capital Increase

As of the final deadline for subscription of 30 September 1996, subscriptions
to the Fourth General Capital Increase (GCI IV) had been made by 55 member
countries. The total number of sbares subscribed was 1,719,302, amounting

to $24,675.4 million.
Capitalization

As of 31 December 1996, the Bank’s authorized capital stock amounted to
$50,102.7 million (SDR 34,909.9 million). During the year, GCI IV subscriptions of 27 member counrries became effective in an aggregate amount
of 7,776.5 million (SDR 5,418.4 million). As of 31 December 1996, the
subscribed capital stock srood at $49,368 million (SDR 34,398 million).

Performance and Allocation of Net Income

Financial Ratios: In measuring its financial strength, the Bank considers
two decisive income indicators: the reserve/loan ratio (RLR) and the interest coverage ratio (ICR). The RLR is the ratio of reserves to disbursed and
outstanding loans, which measures the Bank’s ability to cope with the
possibility of one or a few borrowers defaulting on loans, that could lead
to a protracted arrears situation. The ICR is the ratio of net income (before
deducting interesr on borrowings) to interest on borrowings, and measures
the Bank's capacity to meet interest obligations on its debts from income.

On the basis of the 1993 review of financial policies, and given an
unavoidable concentration of the loan portfolio (e.g., the five largest
borrowers account for 85% of the loan portfolio), a minimum RLR target
was set at 25%. In addition, the minimum ICR was set at 1.25. The
maintenance of these minimum requirements will continue to ensure
investor confidence in the Bank’s bonds. At the end of 1996, the RLR
and the ICR were 40.6% and 1.7, compared with 35.2% and 1.7 at the

157ANNUAL REPORT 1996

end of 1995. The higher RLR in 1996, compared with 1995, was mainly
due to higher loan prepayments and the effect of changes in exchange
tates. The concomitant decrease in the average balance of loans outstanding, as a result of higher loan prepayments in 1996, led to a lower
income from loans and, therefore, a lower ICR.

Income and Expenses: Gross income decreased by 10.5% from $1,745.3 million
in 1995 to $1,561.7 million in 1996, as a result of a 2.8% decline in the
Bank's average operating assets and a decrease in the realized rate of
return on the investment portfolio. Of the total gross income,
$1,170 million was generated by the loan portfolio, $359.8 million by the
investment portfolio, and $31.9 million from other sources. For details, see
Income and Expenses - Ordinary Capital Resources table.

The average yield on the foan portfolio declined to 7.1% in 1996 from
7.4% in 1995 due mainly to an increasing share of lower-yielding variablerate loans in the portfolio. The share of such loans increased from 74.3%
in 1995 to 85% in 1996. The yield on the investment portfolio decreased
to 5.6% in 1996 from 6.9% in 1995. This decrease was attributed to lessfavorable conditions prevailing in international fixed-income markets during the year. The overall net return on average operating assets achieved
for the year was 2.5%, compared with 2.8% in 1995.

Total operating expenses amounted to $989.6 million, down
$95.3 million, or 8.8% from the previous year. The fall in expenses was
due to an $84.7 million decrease in financial expenses, a $500,000
increase in administrative expenses, and an $11.1 million decrease in

the prevision for losses. Total operating

of currencies of the Bank's choice; (ii) the pool-based single-currency loan
window in US dollars established in July 1992; and (iii) the market-based
loan (MBL) window, established in December 1994, which provides singlecurrency loans ro private sector borrowers and to financial inrermediaries
in the public sector.

For the first and second semesters of 1996, the Bank’s pool-based
variable lending rates were 5.97% per annum and 6% per annum, respectively,
for multicurrency loans, and 6.89% per annum and 6.82% per annum,
respectively, for US dollar loans. For the first half of 1997, the applicable
lending rates, which are effective from 1 January 1997, are 6% per annum
for multicurrency loans, and 6.79% per annum for US dollar loans.

The lending rates for market-based loans are determined on the basis
of the six-month London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) plus a lending
spread. For private sector borrowers, the spread is determined on a caseby-case basis, while for financial intermediaries in the public sector, the
spread is the same as that which applies to pool-based variable-rate loans
(currently 40 basis points). MBL borrowers have the option of having the
interest on their loans either fixed (at each disbursement) or floating, on
the basis of the six-month LIBOR.

Loans

Loan Disbursements and Repayments: OCR loan disbursements in
1996 totaled $2,562.6 million, an increase of 4.93% from 1995 (see Loan
Disbursements table on page 171). Principal repayments for the year were
$2,344.1 million, of which $1,403.8 million represented prepayment on
loans. On 31 December 1996, cumulative loans outstanding after allowance
for possible losses amounted to $16,070.4 million.

Status of Loans: There were 48 OCR loans approved in 1996, of which
71.5% were made to three countries — People's Republic of China, India,
and Indonesia.

At the end of 1996, nine private sector loans were in arrears. Of these,
three loans with an aggregate outstanding disbursed balance of about
$19.9 million were in nonaccrual status.

Borrowings

The majot objectives of rhe Bank's borrowing and liability management
strategy are to ensure the availability of long-term funds for lending operations, to fund the liquidity portfolio, and to minimize the cost of borrowing
for the Bank and its borrowing member countries. To achieve these objectives, the Bank seeks to do the following:

* maintain a borrowing presence in the major capital markets and,
where possible, increase the size of its public bond issues to
provide “benchmark issues” that increase liquidity in the secondary
markets, broaden the distribution of its bonds, and favorably
align its funding and trading spreads with those of other
supranational borrowers;

* emphasize borrowings in the longer-maturity range (to the extent
that the related borrowing costs remain attractive) to minimize

fluctuations in its lending rates and to ensure a reasonable maturity
telationship between borrowings and loans;
expand its investor base by borrowing in the private placement
markets of various currencies;
* tap new markets, especially where this will help develop capital
markets in the Asian and Pacific region;
* use swap markets where cost-efficient arbitrage can significantly
lower the cost of target currencies and transform structured
financing into conventional fixed-rate liabilities; and
use short-term bridge financing should temporary deficiencies in
disbursements or debt-service currencies arise, and if market
conditions are not attractive for bond issues with longer maturities.
In view of higher-than-expected loan prepayments, the total amount
of funds raised by the Bank during 1996 - $583.7 million — was considerably
below the total envisaged at the beginning of the year. The year’s borrowings were all issued as fixed-rate liabiliries (see Borrowings table) and were
swapped into US dollar fixed-rate and floating-rate liabilities to fund loans
under the pool-based single-currency loan window in US dollars and the
market-based loan window, respectively. The average maturiry of rhe
borrowings undertaken in 1996 was 9.5 years, compared with 9.9 years in
1995. The after-swap cost of the fixed-rate US dollar liability was 5.92%,
compared with 6.38% in 1995, In February 1996, the Bank offered a tenyear Euro guilder public bond issue in the amount of Dutch guilder
(f)400 million, which was swapped into a US dollar fixed-rate liabiliry.
Underscoring its continuing commitment and efforts to assist
in the further development of the Asian and Pacific region’s emerging bond
markets, the Bank returned to rhe New Taiwan dollar (NT$) bond market
in December 1996 with a NT$7,000 million domestic public bond issue.
With a view to achieving a broad distribution and secondary market liquidity,
approvals were secured from the Government to classify the Bonds as an
eligible instrament for purposes of the Central Bank’s rediscount window

. as well as for investment by insurance companies. An application was also

submitted to the Government for classification of the Bonds as governmentORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
a a EE SETS NSTI

Bond equivalents, allowing commercial banks to trade and make matket on
the Bonds. The proceeds of the NT$ Bonds were swapped into a US dollar
floating-rate liability.

Also in December 1996, the Bank entered into a 15-year dual-curtency
Euroyen/US dollar private placement for yen (¥) 10 billion. The proceeds
of this private placement were swapped into a US dollar floating-rate liability.

As of 31 December 1996, the Bank’s outstanding borrowings amounred
ro $13,697 million, with an average maturity of 5.89 years and an average
after-swap cost of 5.96%,

Liquid Asset Investments

As of 31 December 1996, the Bank’s liquid assets, consisting of investment
holdings (net of special reserve investments) and unrestricted cash, totaled
$6,188 million, or approximately 42.8% of undisbursed loan balances. Yearend levels of liquid assets are maintained at no less than 40% of undisbursed
balances of both effective and not-yet-effective loans. This helps to ensure
the uninterrupted availability of funds for the Bank's operations and adds
to flexibility in borrowing activities, especially when borrowings may be
temporarily affected by adverse conditions in the capital markets.

The Bank invests its liquid assets with the primary objective of ensuring
the security and liquidity of funds invested. Subject to this objective being
met, the Bank seeks to maximize income on its investments. In fact, the
investment portfolio generates a substantial portion of the Bank’s net income.
The Bank actively manages its liquid asset portfolio within the credit and
market-risk parameters outlined under the Investment Authority approved
by the Board. Under this authority, the Bank is permitted to invest in the
obligations of government and government-guaranteed entities, engage in
securities lending and borrowing, entet into “short” securities positions,
execute transactions in exchange-traded financial futures and options, and
engage in coveted forward investments.

The Bank’s OCR investments increased to $6,332 million equivalent
as of 31 December 1996 from $6,069 million equivalent a year earlier. The
investment portfolio was denominated in 23 currencies. The realized rate
of return on OCR investments in 1996 was 5.6%, compared with 6.9%
in 1995. Holdings of securities remained at approximately 41% of the
portfolio, while investments in short-dated time deposits and other banking
instruments accounted for 59% of the portfolio. The duration of
the portfolio was 12.6 months at the end of 1996, compared with 13 months
at the end of 1995.

To further streamline back-office operations as well:as risk
management, a back-office automation system and a digital information
delivery system were procured in 1996. Both systems ate scheduled
to be implemented during 1997.

161Special Funds

PW CHE BANK is authorized by its Charter to establish and adminisrer

Special Funds, which currently consist of the Asian Development Fund
(ADF), the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF), and the Japan
Special Fund (SF).

The ADF, whose resources consist mainly of contributions mobilized
under periodic replenishments from member countries, is designed to provide loans on concessional terms to those developing member countries
(DMCs) with a low per capita gross national product (GNP) and limited
debt-repayment capacity. At the end of 1996, loans from the ADF accounted for 30% of cumulative Bank fending. The ADF and TASF are
multilateral sources of concessional assistance dedicated exclusively to the
needs of the Asian and Pacific region.

The TASF was esrablished to provide technical assistance on a grant
basis ro DMCs and for regional technical assistance. TASF resources consist
of direct voluntary contributions by member countries, allocations from the
net income of ordinary capital resources (OCR) and ADF contributions,
and revenue from investments and other sources.

The JSF was established in 1988, when the Government of Japan and
the Bank entered inro a financial arrangement whereby the Government
of Japan agreed to make an initial contribution to the Fund and the Bank
became the administraror. The purpose of the JSF is to help DMCs restructure their economies and broaden the scope of opportunities for new investments, thereby assisting in the recycling of funds to DMCs. While JSF
resources are used primarily to finance technical assistance operations, these
resources may also be used for equity investment operations in DMCs.

 

Asian Development Fund

ADF Commitment Authority: At the end of 1995, the maximum amount
of new lending that the Bank could undertake with the available ADF
resources was about $1,400 million. By the end of 1996, after taking into
account amounts of donor contributions which became available during the
year, as well as New loan commitments and movements in exchange rates,
the maximum amount of new lending that could be undertaken with the
available resources had fallen to $400 million. For details, see Table 39 in
the Statistical Annex. .

Future Resource Requirements and ADF VII Negotiations: Negotiations
on the sixth replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (ADF VII)
continued throughout 1996 with donor meetings held in Bonn (February),
Manila (April), Hong Kong (June), Kuala Lumpur (September), and
Copenhagen (October). Substantial progress was achieved toward an

agreement that would meet the Bank’s requirement for concessional resources for the four-year period 1997-2000.!

New Financial Planning Framework for the Management of ADF
Resources: The formulation of plans for enabling more efficient use of
nondonor resources, for increasing the volume of such resources, and for
introducing a new planning framework for the financial management of
all ADF resources, represented a substantial commitment on the part of
the Bank in 1996 to meet the evolving challenge of mobilizing concessional
resources. Prudent implementation of these plans will strengthen the
Bank's capacity for concessional resource mobilization in the long run
and serve the interests of the donors and borrowers of ADF resources.

Broadening Support for ADF from within the Region: During 1996, as
part of its efforts to mobilize donor supporr for ADF, the Bank continued
its consultations with nonborrowing DMCs and several higher-income
borrowing DMCs to encourage them to strengthen and broaden support for
ADF from the Asian and Pacific region. Six DMCs (Hong Kong; Republic
of Korea; Malaysia; Singapore; Taipei,China; and Thailand) participated in
the ADF VII negotiations in 1996.

Donor Burden-Sharing: During the ADF VII negotiations held in 1996,
donors continued to emphasize the importance of fair and equitable burdensharing for mobilizing donor resources for ADF. Donors agreed that the

overall burden share between nonregional and regional donors should move
from 55:45 in ADF VI toward parity.

ADF Loan Approvals, Disbursements, and Repayments: In 1996, 44 ADF
loans were approved, of which 50.6% were made to Bangladesh, Pakistan,
and Vier Nam. Cumulative ADF loans grew by 1.1% to $18,758.7 million.
The largest borrowers were Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. ADF
disbursements during 1996 reached $1,234.1 million or a-7.8% increase
over $1,144.9 million in 1995. At the end of the year, cumulative disbursements from ADF resources totaled $11,98(.3 million. Loan repayments during
the year amounted to $136.1 million, and cumulative repayments were
$900 million. During 1996, seven ADF loans were repaid in full. For details,
see Table 9 in the Statistical Annex and Loan Disbursements table on page 171.
Loans to Afghanistan have been in nonaccrual status since the beginning of 1993. Total outstanding loans to Afghanistan amounted to
$30.4 million, or 0.24% of the total ADF loan portfolio. Nine loans to
Solomon Islands were in nonaccrual status as of 31 December 1996.

Portfolio Position: The ADF investment portfolio at the end of 1996
amounted to $459 million, compared with $418 million at the end of 1995.

{ On completion of their negotiations in Tokyo on 17 January 1997, donars recommended
$6,300,000,000 (SDR 4,299,343,497) as che level of ADF operations for the four-year period
1997-2000. They also recommended that, initially, new doner contributions amount to
$2,609,837,120 (SDR 1,781,045,436). In addition, rhe donors recommended that nondonar
tesnurces amount to $3,300,000,000 (SDR 2,252,037,069).SPECIAL FUNDS

 

Of the portfolio, 9% was held in securities issued or
guaranteed by governments of member countries. The
remainder was invested in deposits and other hank
instruments in member countries. The return on
ADF investments over the year was 4.2%, compared
with 5.7% in 1995.

The portfolio was denominated in 18 currencies.
Japanese yen and US dollars fonned 30% of the porrfolio.

ADF Revenue and Expenses: In 1996, the excess of
ADF revenue over expenses (net income) was
$63 million, bringing the accumulated surplus to
$1,011 million at the end of the year.

Gross revenue, consisting mainly of revenue from
ADF investments and service fees on ADF loans,

 

 

 

 

amounted to $145 million. Expenses, consisting mainly
of administration charges payable to OCR, were

$82 million.
Technical Assistance Special Fund

The TASF portion of ADF VI contributions received by the Bank as of
31 December 1996 amounted to $147.3 million (equivalent to $140.8 million at the exchange rates specified in Governors’ Resolution No. 214).
There was no allocation of net income of OCR ro TASF for 1996.
During the year, India offered a contribution (its fourteenth) to the TASF,
amounting to $131,000 equivalent,? and Pakistan made a direct voluntary
contribution of $63,000 equivalent. Pakistan's contribution (its twentieth)
was parrly untied, available for use in financing costs of services and facilities procured from all DMCs.

As of end-1996, total TASF resources amounted to $630 million,
composed of allocations from ADF V and ADF VI contributions ($238 million),
allocations from OCR net income ($261 million), direct voluntary contributions to TASF ($85.7 million), income from investments and other sources
($48 .7 million), and transfers out of TASF to ADF ($3.5 million). Of the
total TASF resources, $511.9 million had been used/committed, leaving an
uncommitted balance of $118.1 million. For details, see Table 40 in the
Statistical Annex.

 

Operations and Resource Position: The TASF contributed 42% of funding for services to member countries, with 169 technical assisrance projects
effective during the year. Revenue from investments increased from
7.9 million in 1995 to $8.8 million, despire a decline in the yield of
TASF investments from 4.1% in 1995 to 3.6%, due mainly to additional
resources available from the second regularized TASF replenishment.
Total revenue and contributions amounted to $14 million.

Japan Special Fund

Review of Activities: During 1996, the Government
of Japan provided a rotal amount of ¥9.03 billion
(equivalent to about $79.9 million) for its ninth-year
conrribution to the JSF. The amount included
¥7.0 billion in regular conrributions and ¥2.03 billion
in supplementary contributions. This brought Japan’s

$633.9 million, excluding translation adjustments) . For
details, see Table 41 in the Statistical Annex.

The cumulative total included regular contributions amounting to
¥60.6 billion and supplementary contributions of ¥12.23 billion. The supplementary contributions were to be used for organizing symposia/training
(40.29 billion), women in development activities (¥1.5 billion), environmentrelated activities (F7.7 billion), and for activities to promote the private
sector (¥2.74 billion).

Of the total contributions received, $326.54 million had been used as
of 31 December 1996, including $324.44 million for technical assistance and
$2.1 million for equity investments. Funds awaiting disbursements are invested.
In 1996, income from such investments amounted to $2.44 million, down
by 61,6% as a result of a decline in interest rates. As agreed with the
Government of Japan, part of the investment income was used to defray the
Bank’s direct and identified administrative expenses.

Operations and Resource Position: Total expenditure amounted ro
$76 million (up 1.5%) for services to member countries and $1.3 million (up
16.4%) in administrative expenses.

Despite additional contributions committed during the year, there was
an operational deficit, which decreased JSF net assets to $314.9 million.

The cash flow position remained satisfactory. The $79.9 million received
from contributions, together with the $3 million received from interest
earned on investments, provided the major source of funds.

At year-end, che quantum of JSF investments stood at $416 million,
down 7.5%. Other assets, comprising due from banks, advances to consultants,
and others, decreased by 8.2% from $4.9 million to $4.5 million, while
accounts payable stood at $500,000.Project and Program
Administration

PYF CHE STEPS in a typical Bank-financed project include project

identification, fact-finding to establish project feasibility, appraisal to
assess project soundness and viability, consideration and approval by the
Board, and finally, project implementation. Some projects may require technical assisrance to collect pertinent information or undertake preliminary
project design. Many projects are also subjecr to postevaluation when
completed.

Each step is accomplished with developing member country (DMC)
participation, ensuring that identified projects fit within the national
development program. In appraising a project, its technical, financial, economic, social, environmental, production, marketing, and management aspects,
as well as loan conditionalities, are closely examined. This helps to pinpoint
specific steps necessary to ensure the project’s smooth and efficient
implementation and operation.

Implementation, which generally takes around seven years depending
on the type and nature of the project, is assessed by Bank review missions,
which visit the project at least once a year throughout the implementation
period. Bank loans are often channeled through executing agencies, government departments, semigovernment and public enterprises, and to tbe
private sector, often through national development finance institutions. To
help in resource mobilization and more efficient use of investible funds for
economic development in DMCs, Bank loans are also channeled to the
private sector in DMCs, without seeking a guarantee from the governments.
The loan is disbursed to meet expenditures under the loan agreemenr, as
and when they are incurred. In this chapter, the implementation and disbursemenr phases of the project cycle are discussed, as is private sector
involvement in the process.

Administration

A total of 487 projects were under administration as of end-1996. These
included 430 projects in the public sector and 57 projects in the private
sector. Of the public sector projects, 401 were performing satisfactorily (by
conforming to target dates and project costs, and by complying with loan
covenants established during appraisal), 28 faced implementation or operational problems, and one was considered inactive. For details, see Table 21
in the Statistical Annex.

Altogether, 704 project administration missions, including private
sector loan missions and multiproject missions, were fielded to review
the progress of projects and to discuss problems, if any, with executing
agencies. These missions spent a total of 7,784 persondays, or an average
of 11.8 persondays per project. The average was significantly higher than
lasr year’s 7.1 persondays per project due to inclusion of days spent by
supporting staff on missions. Implementation support was provided to

167ANNUAL REPORT 1996

executing agencies by the Bank's regional and resident missions. Portfolio
performance reviews were carried out to improve disbursements by restructuring or reformulating slow-moving projects and identifying loan proceeds
for cancellation.

Country project review missions were undertaken in ten DMCs in
1996. The purpose was to discuss impJementation problems, cross-sectoral
issues, and remedial measures with senior government officials.

The implementation of 78 projects was completed during the year, bringing to 1,051 the cumulative number of completed projects. Project completion
teports were prepared for 45 projects. The total number of reports prepared
as of end-1996 was 719. For details, see Table 2! in the Statistical Annex.

As in earlier years, project administration procedures continued to
be revised in light of the Bank's strategic plan. Computer systems continued
to be developed for better monitoring and evaluation of benefits. Nine
seminars and workshops were held to enhance the implementation capabilities
of executing agencies (see Seminars on Project Implementation and Administration,
1996 table). A total of 284 senior and middle-level officials benefited from
these activities. [n addition, five in-house seminars were held for Bank staff
dealing with project processing and administration.

Contract Awards

During 1996, contracts totaling $3,980.4 million (excluding contracts for

Loan Disbursements

The 1996 loan disbursements, a new disbursement record, amounted to
$3,797 million, exceeding the year's target of $3,708 million by 2% and
1995 figures by 6%. Of the 1996 total, OCR disbursements amounted
to $2,563 million and ADF disbursements $1,234 million, representing
68% and 32% of the total amount, respectively. This was achieved
despite a slight increase in loan approvals for 1996 amounting to
$5,545.1 million, about 0.7% above the 1995 loan approvals. The
comparative details of disbursements in 1995 and 1996 by lending modality
are shown in the Loan Disbursements, 1995 and [996 table on page 171.

Private Sector Investment Portfolio

Starting with small stand-alone equity investments in 1983 followed by
loans without government guarantee two years later, the Bank’s private
sector operations have built up a portfolio which totaled $998 million as
of 31 December 1996. This total portfolio was made up of $603 million in
outstanding investments and $395 million in undisbursed commitments,
and represented a 22% increase over 1995, About 62% of the total portfolio
was in loans amounting to $623 million and $375 million in equity investments (see Portfolio Distribution by Sectar, 1996 table).

Over 30% of the total portfolio was accounted for by relatively large
loans and equity investments in infrastructure projects, which had recently
been given priority by the Bank’s private sector operations in line with
the growing trend in DMCs to open the infrastructure sector to private
investment. Another 29% of the portfolio consisted of equity investments
in pioneering private financial institutions, including those rhat help
promote capital market development (e.g., securities firms and rating
agencies), and loans to selected private finance companies and banks for
onlending to small and medium enterprises.

The portfolio also included, to the extent of 17%, equity stakes in
investment funds and fund management campanies, which enable the
Bank to leverage irs own resources for supporting private investment,
These funds comprised venture capical funds, mutual funds, private
equity funds, and lately, larger funds that provide equity and/or debt
funancing to infrastructure projects. The balance of the portfolio consisted
of loans and equity investments in manufacturing, agriculture, and other

industries that received support from the Bank, starting in the mid- 19805
when several DMC governments were beginning to withdraw from certain
industrial activities and encourage the private sector to undertake large
industrial ventures, particularly with foreign technology and investment,

At the end of 1996, the total portfolio included loans and equity
investments in 102 companies, comprising 89 companies in 12 DMCs,
and 13 regional financial entities and funds. Twelve companies were
added to the portfolio in 1996 and nine were removed as a result of loan
cancellation, loan repayment, equity divestment, and investment writeoff. Of the 102 companies comprising the portfolio, 50 were operating
profirably, 30 were in various stages of implementation, and 22 were
underperforming or operating at a loss.

Disbursements in 1996 amounted ro $71 million, down from $160 million
during the previous year. The decline was due mainly to delays in the
implementation of some projects approved during the past year. At the end of
1996, disbursements to 27 companies had yet to be completed.

Interest and other income earned on the private sector portfolio in 1996
totaled $32 million, compared with $35 million in 1995. Dividends received
amounted to $6.9 million (3.2% yield), compared with the previous year’s
$6.3 million (4% yield). Capital gains made on equity divestments during
the yeat amounted to $5.9 million, as against $700,000 in 1995.

Allowance for possible losses on impaired loans and equity investments
in 1996 totaled $56.6 million, representing 9.4% of outstanding loans and
equity investments. This allowance included specific loss provisions amounting
to $16.8 million on impaired loans and equity investments, and general loss
provisions of $39.8 million on the balance of outstanding loans and equity
investments not specifically provided for.PROJECT AND PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION

and Internal Audit

l URING the year, the Bank engaged in both external and internal
/ evaluation processes through its postevaluation and internal audit
functions. Both functions are examined in this chapter.

Postevaluation

The Post-Evaluation Office (PEO) continued to implement the initiatives
commenced in [995 on the recommendations of the Task Force on Improving Project Quality. In support of the direction set out in The Bank's
Medium-Term Strategic Framework (1995-1998), the postevaluation work
program in 1996 again placed emphasis on conducting more impact evaluation studies, reevaluation studies, and special studies, while keeping the
coverage of the project performance audit reports (PPARs) at a level of 30%
of completed projects. During the year, PEO completed a total of
47 postevaluation reports. These comprised 25 PPARs, five technical assistance
performance audit reports, two impact evaluation studies, four reevaluation
studies, two special studies, one rechnical assistance completion report, the
Fifteenth Report of Postevaluation Abstracts, the Eighteenth Annual Review
of Postevaluation Report, two country syntheses of postevaluation findings,
three sector syntheses of postevaluation findings, and the 1996 Annual
Performance Evaluation Program.

Project Performance Audit Reports

While PEO is involved in many areas, most of its efforts are in conducting
PPARs. The 25 PPARs prepared during the year covered 22 projects, two
program loans, and one special assistance project, Of these, 12 project and
program loans were in Group A countries; nine project and program loans
in Group B countries, and four projects in Group C countries. By sector,
there were ten project and program loans in agriculture and narural resources,
four projects in transport and communications, four projects in social
infrastructure, one project in energy, one special assistance project in industry,
two project loans for development finance institutions, and three multisector
project loans. See Classification of Country Groups box on page LI].

Cumulatively, by the end of the year, 477 PPARs had been prepared
for 497 project and program loans covering all major sectors and subsectors
in 26 developing member countries (DMCs).'

Of the 25 projects and programs postevaluated in 1996, 11 (44%) were
classified as generally successful, 1 (44%) as parrly successful, and 3 (12%)}
as unsuccessful. Since the analysis of performance by sector for this year's
postevaluated projects and programs is limited by the small sample size,

satisfactorily, irrespective of country groups,
because of such factors as design deficiency,
inadequate institutional capacity of the executing agency, particularly with
Tespect to project supervision and subproject evaluation, weather disrurbances,
and delayed mobilization by contractors hired.

Total investment costs of the postevaluated ptojects and programs had
otiginally been estimated at $1,714 million. Actual costs upon completion
came to $1,650 million, about 4% lower. The factors responsible for cost
underruns in project costs and Bank financing included reduction in project
scope, movements of exchange rates, underutilization of credit lines, and
overestimation of project costs and contingencies during appraisal.

In terms of actual investment cosrs (comprising both foreign exchange
and local cosrs), 56% of the projects and programs postevaluated were
generally successful, 32% partly successful, and 12% unsuccessful. These
figures indicate that, on average, generally successful postevaluated projects
involve bigger investment costs. In terms of loans disbursed by the Bank,
the respective rates were 32%, 61%, and 7%.

Implementation delays ranging from about one month to seven years
were experienced in 22 out of 25 postevaluated projects and programs. The
average implementation delay was estimated at 2.4 years. In many cases, the
implementation period estimated at appraisal was optimistic, inadequately
taking into account anticipated difficulties in implementation. In other cases,
the delays were artributed to factors such as delays in loan effectiveness;
deficiencies in design and changes in project scope; shortage of inputs and
materials, such as cement and fuel; unsatisfactory performance of conrractors;
lack of counterpart funds; difficulties in recruiting consulrants, delay in
government approvals for local costs; procurement problems; shortage of
trained personnel; land acquisition problems; and civil disturbances.

A number of projects postevaluated during 1996 have contributed to
the social and economic development of the countries concemed (see Economic
and Social Benefits of Selected Projects box on page 176). Experience of the
1996 postevaluated projects and programs highlights, among other things,
several lessons which are relevant to future Bank operations: (i) tbe continued
relevance of keeping project design well-focused, manageable in scope, and

174POSTEVALUATION AND INTERNAL AUDIT

in line with the DMCs’ absorptive capacity for implementation and operations after project completion; (ii) che importance of beneficiary targeting
.o ensure proper delivery of benefits; (iii) the need to incorporate a detailed
performance management mechanism in the project design to increase
efficiency in project implementation and performance; (iv) the need to fully
examine the alternatives at the project preparation and design stage; (v) the
need for covenants in loan agreements to be based on a detailed consideration of whether such covenants are relevant, appropriate, and feasible,
(vi) the importance of Bank leverage to facilitate capacity building early in
a project because its effectiveness decreases as a loan approaches its closing;
and (vii) tbe need to improve consrruction supervision by the government.

Technical Assistance Performance Audit Reports

The five technical assistance performance audit reports prepared in 1996
related to the development of a small-scale rural credit project in Viet Nam;

strengthening rhe industrial
waste management capability
of the Ministry of Industry and
Handicrafts in Lao PDR; supparting policy analysis in the
Ministty of Finance in the PRC;
institutional strengthening of
the Agricultural Bank of Papua
New Guinea; and urban transport planning in Malaysta. The
projects in PRC, Lao PDR,
Malaysia, and Viet Nam were
found to be generally successful, while the project in Papua
New Guinea was classified as
partly successful.

The experience of the
postevaluated technical assistance projects revealed that, for
mote effective implementation
of technical assistance grants
involving training in transition
economies, the general background of the trainees should
first be evaluated, and remedial action incorporated in the
training to increase absorption
of training benefits. The other
lessons learned were that high
levels of technical assistance
ownership by the government
and the recipient agency,

Postevaluation Approach and Project Classification

THE BANK undertakes postevaluation of
completed projects to (i) provide accountability to irs shareholders; and (ii) distill lessons of experience to improve the quality of
future projects and enhance the development
impact of its lending ta DMCs. The Bank
adopts a two-step evaluation system. The first

  

step consists of the preparation of a project
completion report (PCR) for all completed

projects /programs by the operational divisions

 

responsible for their processing and implementation. The principle behind this approach is that, for most effective learning
and impact en future operations, the initial evaluation should be carried out by
those who have been direecky involved. To
ensure an independent evaluation, the second step consists of the preparation of a
project performance audit report (PPAR)
hy the Posr-Evaluation Office. The PPAR
evaluates the effectiveness and sustainability
of a project in achieving its objectives, and
audits rhe PCR for

iocusing on specific issues meriting closer

 

dequacy and integrity,

attention.

On the basis of implementation
experience, perturmance, and expected deare classified as

velopmenral impact, proj

   

generally suceesstul, partly successful, or
unsuccesstul. A project is considered generally successful if it is expected to be econemically viable or can generate economic and

social benetirs commensurate with original

expectations and/or costs incurred, A project
is rated as partly successful if its benefits are
believed to be sustainable at reduced levels,
with reasonable prospects for improvement if

of postevaluation may be revised during subsequent reevaluation which is conducted on
selected projects. Also, a partly successful

Postevaluation is undertaken not only
through the preparation of PPARs bur also
through evaluation studies which are aimed
at more intensive analysis of particular issues
or subjects of broader relevance to the Bank's
operations, policies, and procedures. These
studies comprise impact evaluation, reevaluation, and special studies. Impact evaluation
provides insights into the extent ta which
the benefits of Bank lending in a particular
sector are spread and sustained. Reevaluation

assistance objectives.

Impact Evaluation Studies

During the year, two impact studies were carried out to evaluate the impact
of Bank assistance to rhe industrial crops and natural resource sectors in
Sri Lanka and to assess the Bank's assistance to DMCs for benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME).

The Sri Lanka study (consisting of projects, program loans, and technical assistance approved between 1968 and 1995) aimed to assess the major
impacts of the Bank assistance in promoting modernization and development
in the sector, particularly the tea, coconut, and sugar industries. Over the
early period covered by the study, the sector performance was adversely
affected by government regulations and fiscal controls, Consequently, rhe
record of success with postevaluated projects was mixed, and, overall, the
sector had lost its competitive advantage. lt was also founcl rhat during the
latter period, the performance of the sector was considerably enhanced

Economic and Social Benefits of Selected Projects

A NUMBER of projects postevaluated in 1996 were found to
have provided tangible economic and social benefits to the

DMCs concerned. They also addressed crosscutting issues, such

as poverty reduction, improvement of the status of women, and

environmental protection. Sume examples follow.

176

A flood damage restoration project in Pakistan involved
the restoration of structures in the road, education, and
water subsectors for about 2,000 subprojects. Flood prorection and ir
conditions for crop production and protection of infra
vation works generally restored the basic

 

structure such as towns, villages, roads, schools, and
health centers.

In Indonesia, the irrigation package project resulted in
increasing tice production and farm incomes in the
West Semarang area. The increased incomes contributed to poverty reduction in the project area. Since
women do a considerable amount of planting, weeding,

 

and fertilizer application, the higher crop intensity has
meant that more women are engaged in such work, thus
further contributing to increases in family incomes.

A water supply project in Malaysia has generated considerable economic and social benefits by improving the
quality of life through the availability of portable water
for lecal communities, including low-income groups.
The population covered by the water supply provided
under the project has increased from 38% in 1984 to
over 90% in 1996.

through program loan assistance provided which addressed relevant policy
issues. Important reforms leading to the abolition of ad valorem taxes
and export duties (tea and coconut) had been carried out, thus improving the capacity of operators to reinvest. Furthermore, plans had been
prepated for privatizing the plantarion estates. The study identified a
continuing need to improve the macroeconomic management of the
economy, reduce inflation, increase the availability of long-rerm capital, and
provide appropriate fiscal incentives for facilitating further investments in
cultivation and factory processing.

The second impact study was carried out under a tegional technical
assistance for Evaluation of Bank Assistance to Developing Member Countries
for Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation, approved in June 1995. The study
covered a review of 128 Bank loans (amounting to $5.6 billion) and
related technical assistance projects provided to the agriculture and
social infrastructure sectors in five countries: Bangladesh, Indonesia,
Pakistan, Philippines, and Sri Lanka. The study indicated that the Bank's
overall experience in terms of the three sets of BME activities, ie.,
benchmark surveys, benefit moniroring, and benefit evaluation, has been
mixed. Although Bank guidelines on BME were adhered ro in a large
number of cases, results have not been as positive as expected. The most
established BME activity was the conduct of benchmark studies. However, its purpose of providing indicators for BME was not achieved,
mainly because of lack of clear definitions of indicators and parameters
required for such activity. Bank efforts aimed at BME capacity building
and institutional development have not been effective cither. Based on
the workshops conducted under the regional technical assistance, the
study concluded that the Bank's current practice of undertaking BME
at individual project level was inadequare and there is a need to link
it with the sector and eventually with the national level. A project performance management system (PPMS) which focuses on all levels of project
performance would be a better system.

Reevaluation Studies

The Songkhla and Phuket Ports Project in Thailand was reevaluated in
1996, five years after its postevaluation. Contrary to earlier concerns about
the inability of the ports to attract and increase cargo rraffic, cargo throughput at each port accelerated ancl the volumes are approaching each port's
maximum handling capacity. The average daily traffic volumes using the
two bridges were found to exceed by over six times the appraisal estimates
and by nearly four times the revised estimares at postevaluation. Significant
socioeconomic impacts were identified in terms of diversity in employment
opportunities and the local development resulting from the construction of
the bridges and roads component. Hence, the project was reassessed from
partly successful to generally successful.

A reevaluation of the Lower Citanduy Irrigation Project in Indonesia
found a substantial improvement in project outputs since the time of
postevaluarion in 1991. This resulted in an upgrading of the project’s performance from partly successful to generally successful. The project provided
an effective irrigation system and flood and tidal protection facilities, and
assisted in onfarm developmenr which helped raise rice production. Tbe

teevaluation also highlighted substantial benefits brought about by the road
and water supply components. The project roads enabled the farmers to
have easy access to markets, resulting in better farmgate prices for
produce and lower prices for inputs. Delivery of government services has
improved significantly, bringing about rapid socioeconomic development
in the region. Some of the major lessons learned from the project suggest
that (i) involving beneficiaries and developing operation and maintenance capabilities are essential to the success of irrigation projects; and
(ii) project facilities should not be turned over to local authorities unless
they are technically and financially equipped to assume the responsibility of managing the project.

The performance of the Compensatory Forestry Sector Project in
Malaysia, which was postevaluated in 1991 and reevaluated five years later,
was reclassified from generally successful to partly successful. At postevaluation,
the project was rated generally successful although there were concerns that
pfoject sustainability could be achieved only if adequate attention were
given to recruitment of labor, research to alleviate fungal diseases, promotion of market demand for acacia mangium, and improved recruitment of
contractors. The reevaluation, however, found that (i) labor problems became
more acute and caused delays in carrying out the silvicultural treatments;
(ii) fungal diseases became more prominent in areas with trees over ten years
old, affecting tree growth and yields; and (iii) production of project sawlogs
could only reach about 57% of appraisal target. The major lessons raised
during postevaluation were confirmed by the reevaluation. These are (i) the
adoption of a single-species forest plantation which faces the possibilicy of
a major disease outbreak if forest management and silvicultural treatments
do not incorporate measures for dealing with higher risks of pest and disease
outbreaks; (ii) the pioneering nature of the forestry plantation should be
emphasized so that alternative management strategies can be tested;
(iii) research and development are crucial even before project commencement to determine the optimum operations and maintenance schedules as
well as effective disease control; and (iv) labor availability must be ascertained during appraisal as its constraint would delay most silvicultural
treatments and affect growth.

The reevaluation of the Indonesian South Kalimantan Livestock
Development Project, six years after it was postevaluated, reconfirmed the
partly successful rating given during postevaluation. The credit system
introduced under the project was ineffective in promoting rapid expansion
of the provincial livestock base. Instead of stabilizing, as expected during
appraisal, the goat herd had disappeared. However, the cattle herd was
growing faster than expected and had productivity levels comparable with
other parts of Indonesia. The increase in cattle had a beneficial impact on
crop output, although at a lesser extent than expected at postevaluation.
Furthermore, the project’s socioeconomic and environmental impacts were
positive. By increasing the amount of manure available for use on soils, the
project cattle helped improve fertility of farmlands.

Special Studies

Two special studies were carried out during the year to assess the effectiveness
of Bank technical assistance for capacity building in Indonesia and Vanuatu.POSTEVALUATION AND INTERNAL AUDIT

Tn Indonesia, the special study evaluated 61 of the 122 advisory and operational technical assistance (AOTA) projects that the Bank had financed as
of end-1995. The AOTAs covered a wide range of sectors and subsectors
and 32 recipient agencies. The study found that the AOTAs were effective
in providing policy advice through studies, manuals, legislation, and development plans. However, the impact in terms of sustainable institutional
development was less apparent, as the process is complex and time-consuming. The study emphasized the need to improve the monitoring of the
implementation of technical assistance recommendations and to develop a
strategic thematic focus for technical assistance operations in the country.
The study also found that in some technical assistance projects, where
government ownership was inadequate, the quality of technical assistance
provided suffered.

All 18 AOTAs funded by the Bank in Vanuatu as of 31 December 1995
were reviewed. The study revealed that such AOTAs conttibuted to the
design and implementation of organizational and financial information systems
in the country. They also helped enhance the policy formulation capacity
of the Government and strengthen its legal framework and development/
enforcement capacity. However the AOTAs in Vanuatu were also constrained
by the limited supply of experienced counterparts and trainees; the relative
ineffectiveness of the implementation approaches adopted; limited local
commitment to AOTAs; and infrequent supervision by the Bank. The study
demonstrated that the high quality of technical input is a necessary but not
sufficient condition of AOTA effectiveness. Among other things, AOTAs
to Vanuatu, as to other DMCs, must factor in sociological conditions, be
technologically appropriate, and have local acceptance.

Recently, the Bank took a number of initiatives to address some of the
issues cited in the Indonesia study such as (i) the identificarion of priority
sectors for institutional development and key agencies for organizational
development, and (ii) a wide-ranging review of technical assistance operations. A number of recommendations have been made to introduce rigor
in technical assistance identification, processing, and design; and improve
implementation processes and training in the technical assistance projects
as well as their supervision and evaluation.

Strengthening the Postevaluation Capability of DMCs

In 1996, PEO administered a study aimed at enhancing the evaluation
capacity in Thailand. It focuses on strengthening the evaluation programs
of the Office of the Auditor General and assisting the National Economic
and Social Development Board in formulating a system for monitoring and
evaluating the performance of the Eighth National Economic and Social
Development Plan. The development of new performance indicators covering
the performance, effectiveness, and impacts of seven basic strategies designed
to achieve 12 specific targets of rhe Eighth Plan is required. The activity
comprises extensive data generation at different levels and in various sectors,
primarily the social infrastructure sector. As part of the technical assistance,
a seminar was organized to present the preliminary findings and
recommendations of the study. Key indicators for health, education, family
life, economic welfare, inequity and poverty, working life, and regional
development have already been identified. Furthermore, preliminary key

Feedback of Postevaluation Findings

Efforts continued during the year to enhance effectiveness of the feedback
system within the Bank to facilitate the application of lessons leatned to
improve new as well as ongoing projects and development activities. The
computerized postevaluation information system, which was redesigned in
1995, was made operational in 1996. The system provides all Bank staff
concerned with a facility to view online inquiries or to print reports on basic
project data and data contained in project completion reports, project
performance audit reports, technical assistance completion reports, technical assistance performance audit reports, reevaluation reports as well as
impact evaluation studies, special studies, and country/sector syntheses.
Briefings for the operations departments were conducted to generate comments
on making the system more user-friendly. The system expedites the dissemination of postevaluation findings and lessons learned to the staff of the
operations departments. This was supplemented by the circulation of the
Fifteenth Report of Postevaluation Abstracts, Eighteenth Annual Review of
Postevaluation Report, two country syntheses of postevaluation findings
(Myanmar and the Philippines), and three sector syntheses of postevaluation
findings (porrs and shipping, roads and road transport, and industrial crops
and natural resources).

Through close interaction with the various departments and offices,
PEO prepared an Action Plan which reflects a number of initiatives already
under way by different departments and offices. The Plan covered seven key
issues: (i) capacity building; (ii) benefit monitormg and evaluation; (ii) project
administration; (iv) implementation delays; (v) cost recovery, operation and
maintenance, and sustainability; (vi) effectiveness of project preparatory
technical assistance; and (vii) follow-up action on project completion report/project performance audit repott recommendations.

Annual Performance Evaluation Program

One of the recommendations of che Task Force on Improving Project
Quality (TFIPQ) was that the Bank should prepare each year a comprehensive
Annual Performance Evaluation Program (APEP) to bring together the
activities of various departments and offices as they relate to project
performance. The 1996 APEP report presents a review of the 1995 program
of activities provided in the 1995 APEP and the program of activities
planned for 1996. The APEP covets project/program and technical assistance supervision and monitoring activities; the programs for project/program
completion reports and technical assisrance completion reports; economic
and sector work; countty operational programs; country projects’ reviews;
the postevaluation program; and the review of related performance.

The 1996 APEP concluded that the institutional mechanism for
generating feeclback in the Bank is fairly comprehensive and well developed.
Also, there has been growing awareness, appreciation, and use of the feedback
process among Bank staff, as well as by some DMCs. Nevertheless, the scope
for improving the feedback mechanism was identified at various stages ofPOSTEVALUATION AND INTERNAL AUDIT

the project cycle. Also, there were some questions and comments conceming
the level of resources made available in 1995 to strengthen project and
cechnical assistance supervision activities in line with the recommendations
of the TFIPQ. Therefore, the budgeting process needs to be more closely
integrated with the various “change” initiatives of the Bank. The APEP
could help minimize the impact of tighter resource constraints by identifying
weaknesses in the feedback process and proposing cotrective measures on
a timely basis.

Regional Conference

Against the background of generally positive experience of project
implementation in the PRC since its membership in the Bank in 1986, PEO
undertook a study on project planning and management in the PRC in 1996.
The findings of the study wetre first discussed at a workshop conducted in
Beijing which was attended by project implementing agencies from various
provinces in the country. Subsequently, a regional conference attended by
senior officials from 15 DMCs was organized by the Bank in Shanghai to
consider the study's results.

The regional conference was seen by the DMC participants as an
important element of the Bank's support for increased regional cooperation.
The deliberations included (i) an overview of the PRC’s economic achievement, development strategy, and investment management system; (ii) planning and management of Bank-financed projects in the PRC; (iii} specia
features of project planning and implementation experience in the PRC;
(iv) strengths of the PRC’s project planning and management efforts, and
their relevance to other DMCs ar various stages of the project cycle; and
(v) emerging problems in the PRC’s project management and corrective
measures under consideration.

Despite the unique features of the PRC's development planning an
management systems, there are many areas from which lessons can be
learned by DMCs with some adaprations. The key good practices that could
be followed include (i) improving “quality of project at entry” through a
participatory approach in project preparation; (ii) ensuring that projects
reflect sector objectives within the context of the national plan and firm
financing packages: (iii) introducing a strong and structured system o
project supervision, and ensuring continuity of key cechnical and administrative
project staff during the period of implementation; (iv) strengthening the
system of focal governmenr with devolution of authority and access to
resources in che preparation and implementation of projects; and
(v) establishing a system of evaluation of completed projects to monitor
benefits and sustainability. In discussing some general issues relating to the
development process, the conference highlighted the importance of human
resource planning and the need to promote domestic private and foreign
investments to supplement government efforts to accelerate the rate of
economic growth in DMCs.

Evaluation of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization
for Economie Cooperation and Development. This has promoted professional
contact and interaction among agencies in areas relating to evaluation
policy, classification system, methodology and feedback, and the sharing of
information on postevaluation results and findings.

PEO, as the Bank’s representative to the meetings of the Heads of
the Evaluation Units of the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs),
was actively involved in the formalization of the Evaluation Cooperation
Group (ECG) in 1996. The purpose of the ECG is to increase deliberately
efforts and means to cooperate with the aim of (i) strengthening the use
of evaluation for greater MDB effectiveness and accountability; (ii) sharing
lessons from MDB evaluations and contributing to their dissemination,
(iii) harmonizing performance indicators, evaluation methodologies, and
approaches; {iv) enhancing evaluation professionalism within the MDBs;
(v) facilitating the involvement of borrowing member countries in evaluation, and promoting their evaluation capacity; and (vi) collaborating
with the heads of evaluation units of bilateral and other multilateral
development organizations.

Internal Audit

The Bank’s internal audit function conducts periodic, independent, and
objective appraisals of Bank activities to ascertain the adequacy and
effectiveness of controls, and to identify means of improving economy and
efficiency in the use of resources in carrying out the Bank’s development
mission. The internal audit function reports directly to the President. Its
activities are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Board.

Its activities during the year included conducting a formal internal
review of its audit procedures and practices to ensure compliance with
international auditing standards, as promulgated by the Institute of Internal
Auditors, US; making recommendations which led to improvements in
financial planning, more efficient procedures for managing depository accounts,
and more effective controls over loan disbursements; and making
recommendations for strengthening staff accountability in the administrative
services bidding process.

To gain a better understanding of the Bank’s operations in the field
and thereby enable the formulation of more practical and effective
recommendations for the programs and projects departments in complying
with the Bank’s accountability requirements, and formulating the Bank's
project administration policies and procedures, the Bank's internal audit
function undertook audit missions to Pakistan and India and reviewed
selected projects. It also identified opportunities for improving the efficiency
and effectiveness of project-related procurement activities and the timeliness
of submission of audited financial statements by borrowers.

Other activities of the Bank’s internal audit function included (i) providing
an audit perspective to a number of Bankwide projects, including the
development of an information systems strategy and reviews of business
processes; and (ii) providing reviews of new computerized systems to ensure
their effectiveness and efficiency, as well as the presence of adequate controls
to protect data integrity and reduce the risk of loss.POSTEVALUATION AND INTERNAL AUDIT
gr ES

In addition, the internal audit function participated in an advisory
capacity in the technical assistance projects provided by the Bank to Cambodia
and the Maldives during 1996 to help these DMCs strengthen their governmental audit function.

It also helped to ensure the reasonableness of the cost of consulting
services incurred by the Bank for technical assistance projects. Furthermore,
it provided advice to resolve issues resulting from the audits of related
consultants contracts.

The Bank's intetnal audit function also provides integrated assistance
to its outside auditors in carrying out the procedures that lead to their
formulation of an opinion on the Bank’s financial statements. This assistance takes the form of updating internal control questionnaites, examining
selected financial transactions, preparing confirmation letters, and providing
random samples of financial data.

In 1996, the Bank undertook a competitive bidding process to select
outside auditors. As a result, Price Waterhouse (International Firm) was
selected as the Bank’s new outside auditors for the years 1997 through 2000.

“HE EFFECTIVE and sustained achievement of the Bank’s five
A strategic objectives requires a highly skilled, productive, and motivated
staff force. It is in this context that the Bank undertook a comprehensive
review of its policies and strategies related to human resource management,
which included approval of the Human Resource Strategy. Other significant
developments in administration in 1996 included introduction of the External
Assignment Program, initiation of Sraff Study Tours, opening of two
representative offices, approval of two resident missions, and completion of
the Local Area Network (LAN).

Human Resource Management and Development

In July 1996, the Board approved the Bank’s Human Resource Strategy,
which outlines the Bank's strategic objectives with regard to managing its
staff resources. These include the need to strengthen staff competencies, to
enhance work unit and staff productivity, and to promote staff morale and
professional growth, al! with a view to supporting the more effective achievement of the Bank's operating goals and objectives.

The year also saw the initiation of a number of new staff development
programs focusing on areas of increasing operational significance, including
sector analysis and strategy development, good governance and capacity
building, environment and social analyses, and policy analysis and reform.
Other new staff development programs introduced were the External
Assignment Program, which supports the assignment of Bank staff to developing member country (DMC) development agencies (including
nongovernmental organizations) and other international development institutions to gain new skills and perspectives considered strategically important
to the Bank. Also, Staff Study Tours to projects supported by other
development agencies were initiated. Staff leave for extended study purposes
was expanded to cover supporting staff acquiring additional and operationally
relevant qualifications. In general, there has been an extensive emphasis on
promoting staff learning, given the dynamic and constantly changing
environment in which the Bank is operating.

Duting the year, the Bank also made extensive investment in its Manager
Development Program and Mission Leader Program. Both programns target
staff groups who are at the forefront of delivering the Bank’s products ancl
services to DMCs and whose skills must, therefore, be continually refined
and enhanced to meet the Bank’s objectives.

At the end of 1996, the Bank had a total staff of 1,939 coming from
44 of its 56 member countries. The total comprised 653 professional staff !
and 1,286 supporting staff. During the year, there were 75 appointments and
64 terminations of professional staff, wbile 102 supporting staff joined the

Compensation and Benefits

A comprehensive review of the professional staff salary policy and structure was completed in 1996. Based on the review, the following policy
parameters were approved: continuation of the market-based approach
for determination of professional staff salary; use of the World Bank
salary structure, which is based on a survey of rhe salary movements of
public and private sector organizations in France, Germany, and United
States as a basis for the Bank's market-based approach; consideration
of salary changes in selected Asian comparators; and increasing the
telativities of the senior staff salary ranges from 95% to 97.5% of comparable World Bank salary ranges.

Based on the new policy, the Bank's professional staff salary structure
was increased, on the average, by 4.7% and an overall pay increase of 7%
was approved effective 1 May 1996. For Headquarters-based supporting
staff, based on a survey of salary movements in comparator organizations
in the Philippines, an increase in the salary structure by 10.6% and an
overall pay increase of 11.8% was approved effective 1 April 1996.

An allocation of $25 million was approved for a new housing purchase
loan scheme to enable eligible professional staff to purchase their own
residential accommodation starting from January 1997. To take into account
market trends, a new rental subsidy scheme was introduced to take effect
from January 1997. The current rental subsidy scheme was also revised. The
leave scheme was enhanced with the introduction of family leave and the
streamlining of procedures for leave administration.

Revisions to the staff retirement plan were approved in 1996. The
revisions include an increase in the pension accrual rate for pensioners who
retired prior to October 1987, the introduction of a dual-currency option
for payment of pensions, and a change in the methodology for determining
the conversion rate for the currency option from a 60-month to an inflationadjusted career average, subject to a maximum of 15 years.

 

Opening of Representative Offices and
Resident Missions

Through its representative offices and resident missions, the Bank achieves
strengthened representation in donor countries and a broader and more
direct access to the Bank’s various constituencies. To this end, the Bank
opened two representative offices and approved operations in two resident
missions in 1996.

The Japanese Representative Office (JRO) in Tokyo, Japan, which was
opened in November, will have an important role to play in strengthening
the Bank’s resource mobilization efforts in Japan by promoting cofinancing
with official and commercial sources. The JRO will also be a focal point
for disseminating information about the Bank and its activities, advancing
the knowledge of the private sector/business community in Japan concern
" ing trends and opportunities in the Asian and Pacific region; strengthening

relations between the Bank and multilateral and bilateral institutions/ADMINISTRATION

organizations located in Japan; enhancing public awareness in Japan of the
Bank’s role and mission; and cooperating with financial institutions for
purposes of enhanced resource mobilization. The JRO is the Bank's second
representative office ina donor country, the first being the North American
Representative Office, opened last year in Washington, DC.

The third office, the European Representative Office in Frankfurt,
Germany, which was opened in December, will enhance public awareness
about the Bank among its 14 European member countries. Ir will also assist
in the Bank’s resource mobilization efforts by promoting cofinancing with
official and private sources.

The Bank’s resident mission in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, approved in
1996, will help both the Government and the Bank to meet their objectives
of reducing poverty, and improving and protecting the environment. In
addition, the Mission will facilitate coordination with other donor agencies,
assist with activities related to country programming and processing of new
loans, provide a suitable local perspective to project design, and improve
“quality at entry.”

The resident inission in Hanoi, Viet Nam, also approved in 1996, will
enhance the working relationship between the Bank and the Government,
and facilitate project implementation. The Bank’s emphases on policy reform
and institutional development, infrastructure development, rural development, human development, and environment and natutal resource management
will be strengthened as well.

With its resident missions in Cambodia and Viet Nam, the Bank will
have seven resident missions, as well as one regional mission and three
representative offices.

 

Information Technology Program

The existing Information Technology Strategy was developed to support the
Bank’s Medium-Term Strategic Framework. It provides for the implementation of cost-effective and efficient information and office automation systems; establishment and enhancement of an Information Technology
infrastructure to facilitate information flow; improvement of communication and coordination among departments and the enhancement of operational
capacity; and provision of effective end-user support in the proper and
efficient use of computer systems. A review of the Strategy has been done
and a new Information Systems Strategy has been initiated to build on the
current infrastructure as the needs of the Bank evolve.

During the year, implementation of LAN in each of the Bank's
resident missions and representative offices was completed for connection to the Bank's enterprise network. This is a significant milestone in
the Bank’s Information Technology program. [t is also significant in
support of the recommendation of the Task Force for Improving Project
Quality (TFIPQ) for continued delegation of project administration
responsibilities to the resident missions and representative offices. The
LAN provides resident mission and representative office staff with the
ability to share information, use elecrronic mail, improve external
communications through Internet access, and access information and
electronic documents stored at the Bank’s Headquarters. Resident mission and representative office staff have real-time access to mainframe

applications to view project status and related information. The Resident Mission Accounting System, which replaced the manual system,
was implemented in the India and Indonesia Resident Missions and in the
South Pacific Regional Mission.

Also in 1996, full Internet access and Intranet facilities wete extended
to additional staff to provide improved communications with external
organizations and individuals. The World Wide Web provicles a cost-effective means for advertising and sharing useful economic data. In addition,
new information was made available on the ADB Home Page, including
ADB employment information, Expression of Interest Forms for Technical
Assistance, Law and Development, and a Listing of Environmental Impact
Assessments. Intranet prototypes were made available in the following
areas: Learning Opportunities for Staff, Statistical Data of Developing
Member Countries, Security and Safety Manual, and a Home Page for
PRC Operations.

New applications development included implementation of a new
client/server Postevaluation Information System and a Setvice Contract
Administration System. The Loan Financial Information System was
enhanced to accomplish the new local-cost financing reporting scheme,
and Project Administration Committee Notes were made available on
Lotus Notes. Implementation of the Bank Account Reconciliation System and Financial Futures System was coinpleted. The Country Program
Review subsystem of the Strategic Management Information Sysrem was
also completed. The Benefits Administration System, Staff Retirement
System, and Administrative Expense System were enhanced to accomplish the changes in the Housing Assistance Scheme and the new
multicurrency payment scheme for retirement pension. The maintenance
of most mainframe-based systems was outsourced, as was the development
of two new systems.

Groupware applications continued to be developed for Bankwide and
department-specific needs. Bankwide applications developed include the
Operations Manual and Guidelines on Operational Procedures, Compendium
of Staff Instructions, SOCD (Social Development) Handbook, Learning
Resource Center materials, and recent library acquisitions. Departmentspecific applications developed include the Accounting Manual for Contrallers, Strategic Planning Office Staff Resource Management, Provisional
Board Calendar Discussions, Personnel Issues, Tracking System for Human
Resources, a Catalog of Technical Assistance Reports, a Security Issues
Database for Administrative Services, and Individual Consultant Resuiné
for Central Operations Services Office.

Administrative Services

 

In line with the Bank’s thrust for economy and efficiency, several measures
were adopted during the year to rationalize the Bank's administrative
services and enhance theit cost-effectiveness. These services cover a
wide range of functions and are geared to support the Bank's strategy and
operations.

Initiatives in the adminiscrative area include computerization of various
work processes. The computerized Printing Management Information
System was developed and implemented to better manage in-house printingADMINISTRATION

operations to provide efficient, reliable, and cost-effective printing services.
The shift from traditional information delivery to an electronic delivery
system in the Library continued as new services were introduced Bankwide.
The Library’s catalog and various other library acquisitions can now be
accessed by Bank personnel from their desktop computers. Work processes
related to the procurement of services were improved with rhe development
and implementation of the computerized Service Contracts Administration
System. To improve the quality of service and the control and monitoring
of the large number of shipments of the Bank and its staff, work on
developing a computerized Shipment Monitoring System was initiated in
1996. To eliminate repetitive and time-consuming tasks in existing
arrangements for issuance of office supplies, the first of three phases of the
stockless office supplies scheme, i.e., Automatic Requisirioning Procedures,
was implemented.

A new international telecommunications hub was established in
Washington, DC, and leased circuits to several resident missions and
representative offices were upgraded, resulting in improved quality of
communications and cost reductions in telephone and fax services. The
Bank's energy conservation project continued to be implemented, resulting
in enhanced energy efficiency and significant savings in energy costs.

During the year, the Government of the Philippines exempted expatriate
spouses of Bank staff from obtaining work permits to undertake local
employment. This has added to rhe country's pool of qualified personnel,
and avoided displacement of expatriate spouses.

Budget

Internal Administrative Expenses (AE) for 1996 amounted to $183.640 million, against rhe original budget of $189,881 million. The IAE Budget for
1997 of $199.497 million (summarized in Appendix 4) represents an increase
of $15.857 million over the actual expenses of $183.640 million incurred in
1996. The increase is mainly due to provisions for anticipated price changes,
increased expenses for the 30th Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors
in Japan in 1997, higher requirements for staff development, full-year
administrative expenses of operating the newly established representative
offices and resident missions, and the usual provision for general contingency.

Reorganization of Controller’s Department’s
Disbursement Activities

A reorganization of the Disbursement Divisions (East and West) in the
Controller's Department was approved in 1996 and made effective on
1 January [997. The purpose of realignunent of disbursement activities is to
increase efficiency, expedite response time, achieve staff savings, and
provide better supporr to borrowing member countries as well as Bank’s
operations departments. These objectives will be achieved through the
following: (i) in this country-focused setup, each unit will handle disbursements for technical assistance, public and private sector loans, as
well as cofinancing loans in one or more member countries; (ii) che
approving authority of a single officer for loan vouchers will be increased
from $200,000 to $5 million and the approving authority of a technical

189ANNUAL REPORT 1996

190

assistant for technical assistance vouchers will be increased from $2,000
to $10,000; and (iii) the supervisory layer (Section Chiefs) between the
Unit Officers and Assistance Controller will be removed. Overall, these
changes will lead to a flat but more focused and efficient organizational
setup for the disbursement functions of the Bank.Financial Statements and

Nature of Operations

The Asian Development Bank, a developmen finance institution, was established in 1966 with its Headquarters in
Manila, Philippines. The Bank and its operations are governed by the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter). Its pri

   

cipal objective is to help

 

accelerate economic and social development of its developing member countries in the Asian and Pacific region by
providing financial and technical assistance for pro
and pregrams which will conrribute to sustainable economic development and social advancement. As of 31
December 1996, the Bank is owned by 56 member countries, 40 countries from the region and 16 countries from

 

 

outside the region.

 

Mobilizing financial resources, including cofinancing, is an
integral part of the Bank’s operational activities. In addi
tion, the Bank, alone or jointly, administers on behalf of

j

 

   

donors, including members, their agencies and other de
opment institutions
include tech

regiona al programs.

 

funds restricted for specific uses which

ical

 

The Bank’s ordinary operations comprise loans, equity investments and guarantees. It finances its ordinary operations through borrowings, paid-in capital and retained

earings.
Limitations en Loans, Guarantees and Equity Investments

Article (2, paragraph | of the Charter provides that the
coral amount outstanding of loans, equity investments and
guarantees made by the Bank shall not exceed the total of
the Bank's unimpaired subscribed capital, reserves and
surplus, exclusive of the special reserve. At 31 December
1996, the rotal of such loans, equity investments and guar
antees aggregated approximacely 55.6% (65.0% — 19°5) of
the total subscribect capital, reserves and surplus, as defined.

Article 12, paragraph 3 of the Charter provides that e.uity
investments shall not exceed 10% of the unimpaired actu
 

ally paid-in capital together with reserves and surplus, exclusive of the special reserve. At 31 December 1996, such
equity investments represented approximately 3.99% (2.79%
— 1995) of che paid

Valuation of Capit

The authorized capital stock of the Bank is defined in
Article 4, paragraph | of the Charter “in terms of Unireil
States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on 31
January 1966” (the 1966 dollar) and the value af each
share is clefined as 10,000 1966 dollars. The capital stox

hacl historically been translated into the current Uni
States dollar (che Bank’s unit of account) on the basis of iis
par value in terms of gold. From 1973 until 31 March L972
the rate arrived at on this basis was $1.20635 per 1966
dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at which time the Second
Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect, currencies
no longer have par values in terms of gold. Pending the
Bank's

  

ection of the appropriate successor to the 1966

ss of 31 December 1996, the value of the SDR in terms of
e current United States dollar was $1.43520 (51.48649 —
1995) giving a value for each share of the Bank’s capital
equivalent to $14,352.00 ($14,864.90 — 1995). However,
he Bank could decide to fix the value of each share at
$12,063.50 based on the 31 March 1978 par value of the
United States dollar in terrns of gold.

Translation of Currencies

 

Assets and liabilities are translated from their functional
currencies to the reporting currency generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period.
Income and expense amounts are translated for each semimonthly period generally at the applicable rates of e3
change at the beginning of each period; such practice

 

approximates the application of average rates in effect during
the period. Translation adjustments other than those relating to maintenance of SDR capital values (see Notes I and
), are charged or credited to “Accumulated translation
adjustments”. Exchange gains or losses on currency transactions among functional currencies are included in income.

nvescements

All investment securities held by the Bank are considered
by management to be available for sale and are reported at
estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and lesses exeluded from net income and reported in “CAPITAL AND
RESERVES”. Estimated fair value generally represents
market value. Cost or amortised cost is used to approximate fair value for certain short-term investments not traded
in the market (time deposits, ete.). Realized gains and

 

losses are included in income from investments and are
measured by the difference ber
cost and the net proceeds of sales.

Loans

The Bank’s loans are made to or guaranteed by members or

heir governments, with the exception of loans to the pri
vate sector, and have maturities ranging between 10 and

 

30 years. The Bank requires its borrowers to absorb exchange risks artributable to fluctuations in the value of the
currencies which it has disbursed. It is the policy of the
Bank to place in non-accrual status all loans for which
principal, interest or other charges are overdue by six months.
When loans are placed in non-accrual status, che related
unpaid interest and other charges are reversed and are
deducted from loan interest income and other charges, as
appropriate. Interest and other charges on non-accruing
loans are included in income only to the extent that payments have actually been received by the Bank. ‘The Bank
follows a policy of not taking part in debt rescheduling
agreements.

The Bank determines that a loan is impaired when principal ang interest is in arrears for one year for public sector
loans made to or guaranteed by a member country and six
months for private sector loans, Lf the present value of
spected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s

    

fective interest rate is less than che carrying value of the loan,
a specific valuation allowance is established with a corresponding charge to provision for losses. In addition, the
Bank establishes a general loan loss allowance for private
sector loan portfolio based ona rate approved by the Board
of Directors. These allowances are approved by the Board
of Directors.

Management's periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the
general Joan loss reserve factors and overall allowance for
possible losses is based on the Bank's past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in existing loans and commitments to extend credit and adyerse situations that may
affect a borrower's ability to tepay.

Equity Investments

 

Investments in equity securities without readily dererminable fair values are reported at cost less an allowance for
possible losses. The provisions for possible loss of value are
established quarterly based on management's evaluation of
potential losses for such investments. Equity securities with

 

readily dererminable fair values are reported at fair value,

with unrealized gains and losses excluded from net income
and reported in “CAPITAL AND RESERVES”. The Bank
applies the equity method of accounting to one investment
where it has the ability to exercise significant influence.

Property, Furniture and Equipment

Property, furniture and equipment is stated at cost and,
except for land, is depreciated over estimated useful lives
on the straight-line method. Maintenance, repairs and minor
betrerments are charged to expense.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity
wirh generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of the year and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
year. The actual results could differ from those estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Bank
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS”. Certain amounts in the 1995 statement of cash flows have been reclassified to conform to the
1996 presentation.

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors. The main investment
management objective is to maintain securicy and liquidity.
Subject to these parameters, the Bank seeks the highest
possible return on its investments.

To reduce credit risk, the Bank is restricted by its Investment Authority to invest in (a) securities which are obligations of limited class of issuers, primarily government or
government-guaranteed obligations, multilateral banks and
selected commercial banks; and (b) exchange-traded detivatives of such securities. Exposure to interest rate risk
may be adjusted within defined bands to reflect changing
market circumsrances. These adjustments are made through
the purchase and sale of hoth securities and exchangetraded financial fucures and options. The use of options has
been minimal and there were no outstanding options as of
31 December 1996 (nil — 1995). To increase returns, the
Bank may invest in securities denominated in currencies
other than the original functional currencies and then
enter into covered forward foreign exchange agreements in
order to maintain irs original mix of functional currency
holdings. Accordingly, the financial futures, options and

covered forwards are held for risk management rather than
trading purposes.

Futures: Futures are contracts for delayed delivery of secutities or money market instruments in which the seller
agrees to make delivery at a specified future date of a
specified instrument at a specified price or yield. Initial
margin requirements are met with cash or securities, and
changes in the market prices are settled daily. Changes in
the market value of open futures conrracts are recognized
as gains or losses in the period of the change and included
in income from investments. As of 31 December 1996,
there were no outstanding furure contracts ($9,725,000 —
1995).

Covered forwards: Covered forwards are agreements in
which cash in one currency is converted into a different
currency and simultaneously a forward exchange agreement is executed providing for a future exchange of the two
currencies in order to recover the currency converted. The
Bank records the covered forward as an investment in the
underlying currency. A receivable is created for the forward contract of the originating currency and a payable for
the underlying instrument ro be converted into the originating currency at maturicy. Premiums or discounts are
deferred and amortised as income from investinents over
the life of the underlying instrument. No covered forward
agreements were outstanding at 31 December 1996 (nil 1995).

Short sales: Short sales are sales of securities not held in
the Bank’s portfolio at the time of the sale. The Bank must
purchase the security at a later date and bears the risk that
the market value of the security will move adversely between the time of the sale and the time the security must
be delivered. The payable created upon entering into a
short sale is stated at the market value of the security
subject to the short sale and gains and losses resulting from
changes in market value are included in income {fom investments in the period of the change. Short sales are used
by the Bank for adjusting the risk exposure of the iavestment portfolio and for establishing spread positions To

Prior to 1 July 1986, the lending rate of the Bank was !
on a multicurrency fixed lending rate system under which
loans carried interest rates fixed at the time of loan approval for the entire life of the loans. Effective 1 July (986,
the Bank adopted a multicurrency poal-based variable lending rate system, In addition, in July 1992, the Bank introduced a pool-based variable United States dollar le:ding
system, and in November 1994, a market-based vuriable
lending system was made available to financial intermediaries in the public sector and to the private sector. For
loans to the private sector, approximately 64% (65% —
1995} of the loans were based on variable interest rate.

Undisbursed loan commitments and an analysis of loans by
borrowing member countries as of 31 December 1996 and
1995 are shown in OCR-5.

Public Sectar Loans

Loans outstanding to or guaranteed by members or their
governments with interest rates which vary based on the
pool-based variable lending rate system were fair valved
using an entry value method. Under this method, fair value
was determined based on the terms at which a similar loan
would currently be made by the Bank to a similar borrow
For such loans, fair value approximated the carrying amount.
For undisbursed balances of effective loans and for loans
not yet effective, the contractual amount approximated
fair value.

 

Loans outstanding to or guaranteed by members or the
governments with fixed interest rates (principally loans
made prior to 1 July 1986) were fair valued using a discaunted cash flow method. This method takes into accout

the scheduled cash flows over the average life, by curtency
of the loans, and current funding costs for the average lite
inclucing a factor for administrative costs. The effect of

 

expected prepayments are also taken into account.

The estimated fair value of loans to or guaranteed by members or their governments was not affected by credit risks
based on the Bank's experience with its borrowers.OCR-8

 

As of 31 December 1996 and 1995, there were no public
sector loans in non-accrual status.

Private Sector Loans

Loans outstanding ro the private sector wete fair valued
using a discounted cash flow method. The estimated fair
value of these loans was $349,615,000 ($373,985,000 —
1995).

Three private sector loans were placed in non-accrual status as of 31 December 1996 (four - 1995). The principal
outstanding at that date was $19,899,000 ($36,594,000 —
1995) of which $5,976,000 ($3,805,000 — 1995) was overdue. Overdue interest and other charges on these loans
totalled $4,832,000 ($3,611,000 ~ 1995). Placing these
loans in non-accrual status resulted in a reduction of
$1,415,000 ($1,614,000 - 1995) in income from loans for
the year ended 31 December 1996.

Loan Loss Provision

The Bank has not suffered any losses on loans made to or
guaranreed by members or their governments. No loan loss
provisions have been made against loans outstanding guaranteed by members or their governments, but specific and
general provisions were made against private sector loans
during the year. (See Note K.)

which are not reflected in che financial srarements. Such
guarantees include partial credit guarantees where only
certain principal and/or interest payments are covered.
Such guaranteed payments are generally due 10 or more
years from the loan inception date. As of 31 December

no guarantees are expected to be called.

The Bank functions as lead lender in cofinancing arrangements with other participating financial institutions who
also provide funds to the Bank’s public and private sector
borrowers. In such capacity, the Bank provides loan administration services, which include loan disbursement and
loan servicing. The participating financial institutions generally have no recourse to rhe Bank for their outstanding
loan balances.

In 1991, under che terms of an agreement with the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (Government), the
Bank returned the former headquarters premises which
had been provided by the Gavernment. In accordance with
the agreement as supplemented by a memorandum of understanding, the Bank was compensated $22,657,000 for
the return of these premises. The compensation is in lieu uf
being provided premises under the agreement and, accoridingly, is deferred and amortised over the estimated life of
the new headquarters building as a reduction of occupanc;
expense. At 31 December 1996, accumulated depreciation
for property, furniture and equipment was $48,913,000
($43,195,000 - 1995). The amortisation for the years ended
31 December 1996 and 31 December 1995 amounted to
$566,000 reducing depreciation expense for the new headquarters building from 54,692,000 ($4,684,000 — 1995) to
$4,126,000 ($4,118,000 ~ 1995). Ar 31 December 1996,
the unamortised deferred compensation balance (included
in “ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES
— Miscellaneous") was $19,306,000 ($19,872,000 — 1995).

 

212CONTINUED

 

NOTE H - BORROWINGS AND SWAPS

The Bank uses derivative financial instruments in connection with its borrowing activities to diversify its funding
sources across public and private debt markets, currencies
and instruments. Currency swaps are used to convert a
currency borrowed under advantageous terms into one of
the Bank’s major operational currencies, taking advantage
of the opportunities offered in different financial markets.
Such currency swaps enable the Bank to raise operarionally
needed currencies in a cost-efficient way and to maintain
its borrowing presence in the major capital markets. Interest rate swaps are used generally to reduce balance sheet
interest rate mismatches arising from lending operations.

The Bank issues structured debr which includes embedded
currency and/or interest rate derivatives in order to decrease its cost of borrowing. However, the Bank enters into
siinultaneous currency and/or interest rate swaps to fully
hedge against the effects of such embedded derivatives.

The Bank has a potential risk of loss if the swap counterparty
fails to perform its obligations (see Note O). In order to
reduce such credit risk, the Bank only enters into longterm swap transactions with counterparties eligible under
the Bank’s swap guidelines. The Bank does not anticipate
that any of its counterparties will fail to perform their
obligations under such agreements.

Interest rate swaps: Under a typical interest rate swap
agreement used by the Bank, one party agrees to make
periodic payments based on a notional principal amount
and an interest rate that is fixed at the outset of the
agreement. The counrerparty agrees to make floating rate
payments based on the same notional principal amount.
Amounts receivable or payable under the terms of the swap
are accrued over the period to which the payment relates
and the related cost or income is included in interest and
other financial expenses. The terms of the Bank’s interest
rate swap agreements specifically match the terms of parricular borrowings.

Currency swaps: Under a typical currency swap agreement, one party agrees to make periodic payments in one
currency while the counterparty agrees to make periodic
payments in another currency. The payments may be fixed
at the outset of the agreement or vary based on interest
rates. A receivable is created for the periodic payments to
be received and a payable is created for the payments to be
made. Swap premiums and discounts are deferred and
amottised into interest and other financial expenses over
the life of the underlying instruments. The terms of the
Bank’s currency swap agreements specifically match the
terms of particular borrowings.

The fair value of borrowings outstanding is estimated using
prevailing market prices where available, or estimated replacement values where market prices were not available.

Outstanding currency and interest rate swap agreements
ate fair valued at the estimated amount that rhe Bank
would receive or pay to terminate the agreements based
upon market quotes from dealers.

Capital Stock

 

The authorized capital stock of the Bank as of the end of
1996 and 1995 consists of 3,490,994 shares, of which
3,439,799 shares (2,897,956 — 1995) have been subscribed
by members. Of the subscribed shares, 3,197,806 (2,666,857
— 1995) are “callable” and 241,933 (231,099 — 1995) are
“paid-in”. The “callable” share capital is subject to call by
the Bank only as and when required to meet the Bank’s
obligations incurred on borrowings of funds for inclusion in
its ordinary capital resources or on guarantees chargeable
ro such resources. The “paid-in” share capital has been
paid or is payable in instalments, partly in convertible
currencies and partly in the currency of the subscribing
member which may be convertible. In accordance with
Article 6, paragraph 3 of the Charter, the Bank accepts
non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing demand obligations

 

 

in satisfaction of the portion payable in the currency of the
member, provided such currency is not required by the
Bank for the conduct of its operations. The settlement of
such amounts is not determinable and, accordingly, it is
not practicable to fair value these receivables.

As of 31 December 1996, all matured instalments amounting to $3,090,050,000 ($3,098,153,000 — 1995) were received except for $2,107,000 ($2,144,000 — 1995).
Instalments not due aggregating $382,172,000 ($337,1 10,000
— 1995) are receivable as follows:

Year ending 31 December:

1997 $71,291,000 2000 $59,941,000
1998 98,062,900 2001 48,048,000
1999 91,643,000 2002 13,187,000

Payments in respect of capital subscription instalments in
advance of due dates are shown in the balance sheet (under
the caption “ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES”) as “Advance payments on subseriptiois”
pending the determination of the full value ef such pay
ments based on the rate of exchange to be used by the Bank
as of the dare on which such payments are actually due.

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1{i) of
the Charter, the Beard of Governors has authorized the
setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired “paid-in” capita!
paid by members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2 (a) of
the Charter and of the convertible cutrency portion paid by
members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(b) of the Charter
as of 28 April 1973 to be used as a part of the Special Funds
of the Bank. The resources so set aside amounting to
$68,329,000 as of 31 December 1996 ($70,771,000 — 1995)
expressed in terms of the SDR on the basis of $1.43520
($1.48649 — 1995) per SDR ($57,434,000 in terms of
$1.20635 per 1966 dollar — see Note B), were allocated and

currencies in terms of 1966 dollars, in accordance with the
provisions of Article 25 of the Charter and relevant resolutions of the Board of Directors. The “Amounts required
to maintain value of currency holdings” under “RECEIVABLE FROM MEMBERS?” represent the aggregate amounts
receivable resulting from changes in exchange rates of
member currencies from those previously used for the purpose of computing maintenance of value of the Bank’s
holdings of certain member currencies. The settlement of
such amounts is not determinable and, accordingly, it is
not pra ble to fair value these receivables.

 

Since | April 1978, inasmuch as the valuation of the Bank’s
capital stock and the basis of determining possible maintenance of value obligations are still under consideration,
notional amounts have been calculated provisionally as
receivable from or payable to members in order to maintain
the value of currency holdings in terms of the SDR. The
timing of any establishment and settlement of such amounts
is uncertain and, accordingly, it is not practicable to fair
value such receivables and payables. The notional amounts
as of 31 December 1996 consisting of receivables of
$605,000,000 ($652,799,000 — 1995) and payables of
$243,882,000 ($334,610,000 — 1995) consisr of (a) the
increase of $458, 167,000 ($531,633,000 — 1995) in amounts
required to maintain the value of currency holdings to the
extent of matured and paid capital subscriptions due to the
increase in the value of the SDR in relation to the United
States dollar during the period from 1 April 1978 to 31
December 1996 and (b) the net increase of $97,049,000
($213,444,000 — 1995) in the value of such currency holdings in relation to the United States dallar during the same
period.

the Plan, sball, as a condirion of service, become a participant as of the first day of service, provided that as of such
a date, the employee shall not have reached thé normal
retirement date at age 60. The Plan applies also to members
of the Board of Directors who elect to join the Plan. Retirement benefits are based on length of service and highest
average remuneration during two years of eligible service.OCR-8

The Plan assets are segregated and held in trust and are not

included in the accompanying balance sheet. The casts of

administering the Plan are absorbed by the Bank, except
for fees paid to the investment managers and related charges,
including custodian fees, which are borne by the Plan.

Participants are required to contribute 9 1/3% of their
remuneration to the Plan and may also make voluntary
contributions. The Bank’s contribution is determined at a
rate sufficient to cover that part of the costs of the Plan not
covered by the participants’ contributions.

Net periodic pension cost for the years ended 31 December
1996 and 31 December 1995, which have been included in
administrative expenses for the respective years, consisted

1995). The effect of projected compensation levels was
calculated based on a scale that provides for a decreasing
rate of salary increase depending on age; beginning with
13.5% (13% — 1995) at age 21 and decreasing to 5.00%
(4.50% — 1995) at age 59. The expected long-term rare of

Generally accepted accounting principles require an actuarially determined assessment of the periodic cost of
postretirement medical benefits. Net periodic postretirement
medical benefit cost for the years ended 31 December 1996

The accumulated postretirement medical benefit, vi /igation was determined using medical cost trend rate of 7.5%
(7% — 1995). Increasing the medical cost trend rate by 1%
would increase the accumulated postretirement medical
benefit obligation as of 31 December 1996 by $7,204,600
($2,789,000 — 1995) and the net periodic postretirement
benefit cost by $776,000 ($557,000 — 1995) for the year
then ended. The weighted average discount rate used in
determining the accumulated postretirement medical benefit obligation was 7.5% (7% — 1995).

The fair value of financial instruments that are, short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used co determine
fait values. Financial instruments for which marker quotations are not readily available are valued using methodologies and assumptions which necessatily require the use of
subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which
such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current
transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not determinable.

NOTE P - OFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT RISK
The Bank is a patty to off-balance sheet financial instruments. These financial instruments involve elements of
credit risk in excess of amounts reflected on the balance

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 1996 and 31 December 1995

 

NOTE A — NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Asian Development Fund (the Fund) was established
on 28 June 1974 to carry out more effectively the special
operations of the Bank by providing resources on
concessional terms which

 

ilable almost exclusively to che poorest borrowing countries.

The scotia of the Fund have been subsequently augmented hy five replenishmenrs, the most recent of which
was in August 1992 in a total amount equivalent to
U3$4,200,000,000 to cover rhe operational requirements
for the four-year period ended 31 December 1995. An

    

 

 

 

 

aggregate amount equivalent to $140,000,000 has been

allocated to the Technical Assistance Special Fund.

NOTE B — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Fimetion rrencies and Repo. Currency

 

The currencies of contributing members are functional
curtencies. The reporting currency is the Unired States
dollar, anu the financial statements are expressed in thousands of current United States dollars.

Translation of Cry

 

Assets, liabilities, amounts available for loan commitments and advance payments on contributions are translated from their functional currencies to the reporting
currency generally ac the applicable rates of exchange a
the end of a reporting period. Revenue and expense
amounts are trans
generally ac the

 

 

 

ed for each semi-monthly period
applicable rates of exchange at the
beginning of each period; such practice approximates
the application of averay

   

ze rares in effece during the
period. Translation ments relating co set-aside
resources (see Note Bx are recorded as notional amounts
receivable from or payable to Ordinary Capiral Resources.
Other translation adjustments are charged or credited

to “Accumulated translation adjustments”. Excha

 

 

  

 

 

CONTINUED
gains or losses on currency transactions amoung functional
currencies are included in revenue.

TInvestm

 

All investment securities held by the Bank are considered
by management to be available for sale and are reported at

 

estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from revenue and reported in "UNEXPENDED
Beale AND CAPITAL". Estim
ally represents market value. Cost or amortised cost is
used to approximate faic value for certain short-term investments not traded in the marker (time deposits, etc.).

 

d fair value gen
 

   

Realized gains and losses are included in revenue from
investments and are measured by the difference between
average cost or amortised cost and the net proceeds of
sales.

 

 

Loans

Loans of the Fund are extended to eligible developing
member countries, bear only a service charge and require
repayment over periods ranging from 35 to 40 years. The
Fund requires borrowers to absorb exchange risks attribucable to fluctuations in the value of the currencies disbursed. It is the policy of the Fund to place in non-accrual
status all loans made ro elizible developing member countries if the principal or service charges with respect to any
such loan are overdue by six months. When loans are
placed in non-accrual status, the related unpaid service
charges are reversed and are deducted from revenue. Service charges on non-accruing loans are included in revenue only to the extent chat payments have actually been
received by the Fund. The Bank follows @ policy of not
taking part in debe rescheduling agreements.

The Bank determines that a loan is

 

aired when principal and interest is in arrears for one year for public sector
loans made to ot guaranteed by a member country and six
months for private sector loans. If the present

expected future cash

value of
flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate is less chan the carrying value

31 December 1996 and 31 December 1995

a specific valuation allowance is established with a corresponding charge to provision for losses. In addition, the
Bank establishes a general loan loss allowance for private
sector loan portfolio based on a rate approved by the Board
of Directors. These allowances are approved by the Board
of Directors.

 

t's periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the

 

 

general loss reserve factors and overall allowance for
possible losses is based on the Bank’s past laan logs experience, known and inherent risks in existing loans and
commitments to extend credit and adverse situations that

may affect a borrower's ability to repay.
Contributed Resources

Contributions by member countries are included in che
financial statements as amounts committed from the dare
Instruments of Contribution are deposited and related formalities are completed.

Contributions are generally paid or to be paid in the currency of the contributor either in cash or notes.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity wich
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of
the year and the reported amounts of income and expenses
during the year. The actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Fund
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
"DUE FROM BANKS". Certain amounts in the 1995 statement of cash flows have been reclassified to conform with
the 1996 presentation.

NOTE D — LOANS AND LOAN LOSS
PROVISION

Loans

Loans are fair valued using an entry value method. Under
this method, fair value is determined based on the terms at
which a similar loan would currently be made by the Bank
to a similar borrower. Such terms generally include a setvice charge of | percent and a final maturity of about 40

years. For such loans, fair value approx
amount. The estimated fair value of loa
credit risks because the amount of any such adjustment is
not considered to have a material effect basecl on the
Bank's experien its borr

  

   

     

lisbursed loan commitments and an analysis of loans by
countries as of 31 December 1996 and 31 December 1995
are shown in ADF-4.

The principal amount outstanding of public sector loans
placed in non-accrual status as of 31) December 1996 was
$56,226,000 ($33,800,000 - 1995) af which $7,237,000
($6,173,000 — 1995) was overdue. Overdue charges on
these loans totalled $1,995,000 ($1,458,000 - 1995). Placing these loans in a non-acerual status resulted in a reduction of $744,000 ($396,000 — 1995) in revenue from loans
ded 31 December 1996. Ti

Private sector loans outstanding as of 31 December 1996
were $14,539,000 ($15,597,000 ~ 1995), net of accumulated provision for loan losses as of 31 De 1996 of
$1,778,000 ($1,936,000 — 1995), and there were no

undisbarsed loan commitments (nil — 1995),

 

Loan Loss P rovision

The Bank makes specific provision for possible los
loans to the private sector when principal or service charges
are in arrears for six months or more, based on an evaluation by Management of the collectibility of lo anding. Impairment is measured based on the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the s effective interest rate. On the remainder of the pr

 

s on

  
 
  

te sector
portfolio, rhe Bank makes a general loan loss provision at
a rate approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank’s

NOTEE - NOTES OF CONTRIBUTORS

Nates of contributors are non-negotiable, non-inrerest
beating and, subject to certain restricrions imposed by applicable Board of Governors’ resolutions, encashable by the
Bank at par upon demand.

The Bank currently expects that the notes outstanding at
31 December 1996 will be encashed in varying amounts
over the fifteen-year period ending 31 December 2011.

Notes of contributors are fair valued using an entry value
method whereby fair value is determined based on the
terms at which notes are currently being accepted from
contributors. On this basis, fair value of outstanding notes
of contributars approximates carrying amount.

NOTE F - ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND
ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

Administrative expenses include an administration charge
amounting to $81,991,000 (682,855,000— 1995), The charge

 

232represents an apportionment of all administrative expenses
of the Bank (other than those appertaining directly to
ordinary operations and special operations) based on the
number of loans and equity investments approved for the
year.

NOTE G - SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1 (i) of
the Articles of Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter), the Board of Governors has
authorized the setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired
"paid-in" capital paid by members pursuant to Article 6,
paragraph 2(a) of the Charter and of the convertible currency portion paid by members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(b) of the Charter as of 28 April 1973, to be used
as a part of the Special Funds of the Bank. The capital so
set aside was allocated and transferred from the Ordinary

Capital Resources to the Fund as Set-Aside Resources.

The capital stock of

the Bank is defined in Article 4,

paragraph 1 of the Charter, “in terms of United States
dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on 31 January

1966" (the 1966 dollar). Therefore, Set-Aside Resources

had historically been
States dollar (the Ban
its par yalue in terms

translated inro the current United
’s unit of account), on the basis of
of gold. From 1973 until 31 March

1978, the rate arrived at on this basis was $1.20635 per

1966 dollar. Since 1 A

 

pril 1978, at which time the Second

Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect, currencies
no longer have par values in terms of gold. Pending the
Bank's selection of the appropriate successor to the 1966
dollar, the Set-Aside Resources has been valued for purposes of the accompanyimg financial statements in terms of

ADF-6

the Special Drawing Right (SDR), at the value in current
United States dollars as computed by the IMF. As of 31
December 1996, the value of the SDR in terms of the
currenr United States dollar was $1.43520 ($1.48649 —
1995). On this basis, Set-Aside Resources amounted to
$68,329,000 ($70,771,000 — 1995). If the capital stock of
the Bank as of 31 December 1996 had been valued in terms
of $12,063.50 per share, Ser-Aside Resources would have
been $57,434,000.

NOTE H - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values, Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily require the use of
subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which
such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current
transaction or whether they are acrually exchangeable is
not dererminable.

The Fund's balance sheet carrying amounts are considered
to approximate fair values for all significant financial instruments. See Notes B, D and E for discussions with
respect to investments, loans and notes of contributors,
tespectively,

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 1996 and 31 December 1995

 

 

NOTE A — NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) was established to provide technical assistance on a grant basis to
the Bank's developing member countries and for regional
technic

 

al assistance. TASF resources consist of direct voluntary contributions by members, allocations from the net
income of Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR) and Asian
Development Fund (ADF) contributions, and revenue from
investments and other sources.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation. of the Financial Stacements

The financial statements of the TASF are presented on the
basis of unrestricted, temporarily restricted and permanently restricted net assets. In accordance with the regulations of TASF, $2,216,000 of permanently restricted ner
assets were transferred to ADF during the year ended 31
December 1996. As such, there were no permanently restricted net assets at 31 December 1996.

TASF reports the contributions of cash and other assets as
restricted support if they are received with donor stipulations that limit the use of the donated assets. When a
donor restriction expires, that is, when a stipulated time or
purpose restriction is accomplished, temporarily restricted
net assets are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and
reported in the Statement of Activities and Changes in
Net Assets as net assets released from restrictions.

Investments

All investment securities held by TASF are reported at
estimated fair value, with realized and unreal

 

cl gains and
losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value generally
represents market value. Cost or amortised cost is used to

 

approximate fair value for certain short-term investments
not traded in the market (time deposits, etc.).

Contributions

Contributions from member countries are included in the
financial statements from the date contribution agreements
become effective, Contributions from donors which are
restricted by them to technical assistance project
grams with specified procurement sources are classi

 

  

Las
temporarily restricted contributions. Those without any
stipulations as to specific use are accounted for as unrestricted contributions.

Services to Member Countries

Services to member ce ies are recognized in the financial statements of TASF when the technical assistance
projects/programs are approved and effective. Upon completion of the technical assistance projects/programs, any
undisbursed amounts are written back as a reduction in the

    

 

services to member countries for the year and the correspending undisbursed commitments are reduced.

Reporting Currency

 

The financial statements of TASF are expressed in thousands of current United States dollars. As a matter of
convenience, the United States dollar, the reporting currency, is used to measure exchange gains and losses.

 

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities and uncommitted balances in currencies
other than United States dollars are translated at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting periud.
Contributions included in the financial statements duriag
the year are translated initially at applicable exchanve
rates as of the respective dates when the contributions
become effective. As to cumulative contributions received,
the utilized portions are translated at the applicable exchange rates as of the respective dates of use whereas rhe
unutilized portions are translated at the applicable exchange rates as of the end of a reporting period. Revenue
and expense amounts in currencies other than United

 

240TASFE-6

CONTINUED

 

States dollars are translated for each semi-monthly period
generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period; such practice approximates the application of average rates in effect during the period. Translation
adjustments are accounred for as exchange gains or losses
and are charged or credited to operations.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of the year
and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the
year. The actual results could differ from those estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the TASF
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS”.

NOTE C - INVESTMENTS

The currency compositions of the investment portfolio as of

31 December 1996 and 31 December 1995 were as follows:

 

Currency 1996 1995
Australian dollar $ 6,213,000 $ 5,423,000
Canadian dollar 89,423,000 83,519,000

Others 5,472,000 5,390,000

Totals $2 10,867,000 $264,362,000

The annualized cate of return on the average investments
held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the
beginning and end of each month was 3.63% (4.05% 
1995).

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors. The main investment
management objective is to maintain security and liquidity. Subjecr to these parameters, the Bank seeks the highest
possible return on its investments.

NOTE D - FUNDING

Since 1967, contributions have been made by 31 member
countries. In February 1992, the Board of Govemors, in
authorizing a $4,200,000,000 replenishment of the ADF,
provided for an allocation to the TASF in an aggregate
amount equivalent to $140,000,000 to be used for technical assistance to poorer developing members and for regional technical assistance. This replenishment became
effective in August 1992,

The Board of Governors allocated $81,000,000 to TASF
from the 1994 net income of the OCR in 1995 and nil in
996.

Some of the contributions received were restricted to use
upon procurement sources, while some were given on condition that the technical assistance be made on reimbursable basis.

 

The total contributions received for the years ended 31
December 1996 and 31 December 1995 were as follows:

1996 1995
Unrestricted contributions — $4,651,000 $81,000,000
Temporarily restricted
contributions 63,000 72,000
Total contributions $4,714,000 $8 1,072,000

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 1996 and 31 December 1995

 

NOTE E — UNDISBURSED COMMITMENTS

Undisbursed commitments represenceffective ongoing
financed technical assistance projects/programs which are
not yet disbursed as of the end of the year. The fair value
of such commitments approximates the amounts undisbursed
because the Bank expects that grants will be made for all

 

projects and programs covered by che commitments. When
technical assistance provided as a project preparatory grant
leads to a Bank loan, the amount of the grant exceeding
$250,000 will be refinanced under the loan administered
by the Asian Development Fund, Refinanced amounts of
$317,000 ($87,000 — 1995) were charged to such loans and
credited to revenue from other sources of the TASF during
the year ended 31 December 1996.

NOTE F - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which rhe instrument coud be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily require the use of
subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which
such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current
transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable ..
not determinahle.

The Fund's statement of financial position carrying amounis
are considered to approximate fair values for all significant
financial instruments. See Notes B and E for discussions
with respect to investments and undisbursed commitments,
respectively.Deloitte &

NOTE A - NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Japan Special Fund (JSF) was established in March
1988 when Japan and the Bank entered into a financial
arrangement whereby Japan agreed to make an initial contribution and the Bank became the administrator. The
purpose of JSF is to help developing member countries of
the Bank restructure their economies and broaden the
scope of opportunities for new investments, thereby assisting the recycling of funds to developing member countries
of the Bank. While the JSF resources are used mainly to
finance technical assistance operations, these tesources
may also be used for equity investment operations in the
Bank's developing member countries, The Bank may invest
the proceeds of JSF pencling disbursement and use the
revenue from such investments to pay for direct and idenurred in the administration of JSF.

 

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statemenrs of the JSF are presented on the
basis of unrestricted, temporarily restricted and permanently restricted net assets. There were no permanently
restricted net assets at 31 December 1996 and 31 Dece
ber 1995.

 

     

JSF reports the contributions of cash and other assets as
restricted support if they are received with donor stipnlations that limit the use of the donated assets. When the
donor restriction expires, that is, when a stip
purpose restriction is accomplished, temporarily restricted
net assets are reclassified to unrestricted net a’ and
reported in the Statement of Activities and Changes in
Net Assets as net assets released from restrictions.

 

lated time or

    

Investments

All investment securities held by JSF are reported at estimated fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and

losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value generally
represents market value. Cost or amortised cost is used to
approximate fair value for certain short-term investments
not traded in the market (time deposits, etc.).

Contributions

Contributions by Japan are included in the financial statements from the date indicated by the government of Japan
that funds are expected to he made available. Contributions which are restricted by the donor for specific techaical assistance projects/programs are classified as temporarily
restricted contributions. Those without any stipulation as
to specific use are accounted for as unrestricted con
tions and reported as such.

ribu
 

Services to Member Countries

 

Services to member countries are recognized in the financial statements of JSF when the technical assistance projects/
programs are approved and effective. Upon completion of
the technical assistance projects/programs, any undisbursed
amounts are written back as a reduction in the services to
member countries for the year and the corresponding
undisbursed commitments are reduced accordingly.

 

Functional Currency and Reporting Currency

The functional currency of JSF is the Japanese yen whil
the reporting currency is the United States dollar. The
financial statements are expressed in thousands of current
United States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities and uncommitted balances are translated
from the functional currency to the reporting currency at
the applicable rates of exchange at tbe end of a reporting
period. Contributions included in the financial statements
during the year are translated at the applicable exchange
TALES as of the dates the contributions are received. Rew
enue and expense amounts in Japanese yen are translated

for each semi-monthly period at the applicable rates of
exchange at the beginning of each period; such practice
approximates the application of average rates in effect
duting the period. Exchange gains or losses on currency
transactions between the Japanese yen and other currencies are charged or credited to operations.

Equity Investments

Equity investments with readily determinable fair values
are reported at fair value. The Bank makes provisions for
possible loss of value quarterly based on management's
evaluation of potential losses on investments without readily
determinable fair values.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of the
year and the reported amounts of income and expenses
during the year. The actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the JSF
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to

"DUE FROM BANKS".
NOTE C - INVESTMENTS

The investment portfolio was composed wholly of investments denominated in Japanese yen. As of 31 December
1996, the estimated fair value of the investments was
$416,146,000 ($450,058,000 — 1995), and was due in one

year or less.

The armualized rate of return on the average investments held
during the year, based on the portfolio held at the beginning
and end of each month was 0.60% (1.50% — 1995).

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors. The main investment
management objective is to maintain security and liquidity. Subject to these parameters, the Bank seeks che highest
possible return on its investments.

NOTE D - EQUITY INVESTMENTS

The Bank used JSF resources to make an equity investment
in India in 1990 totalling $702,000 at 31 December 19¥6
($726,000 net of allowance for possible losses of $391,000
- 1995). The investment is reported at its estimated fair
value and the unrealized gain is included in income for the
year.

NOTEE - UNDISBURSED COMMITMENTS

Undisbursed commitments are denominated in United States
dollars and represent effective technical assistance for
projects and programs which have not been disbursed. The
fair value of such commitments approximates the amounts
outstanding because JSF expects that disbursements wil
substantially be made for all the projects/programs covered
by che commitments.

NOTE F - CONTRIBUTIONS AND
TEMPORARILY RESTRICTED
NET ASSETS

All contributions for the years ended 31 December 1996
and 31 December 1995 were received during the respec
tive years. Some of the contributions received were with
the restriction that they were to be utilized for specific
technical assistance projects/programs. Such contribution:
were classified as temporarily restricted support.

Temporarily restricted net assets are available for the following purposes as of 31 December 1996 and 31 December

1995:

$61,165,000 $72,345,000

Net assets released from such restrictions relate to commitments for services to member countries satisfying the conditions specified by the donor.

NOTE G - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

 

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily require rhe use of
subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which
such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current
transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not determinable.

The Fund's statement of financial position carrying amounts
are considered to approximate fair values for all significant
financial instruments. See Notes B and E for discussions
with respect to investments, equity investments and
undisbursed commitments, respectively.

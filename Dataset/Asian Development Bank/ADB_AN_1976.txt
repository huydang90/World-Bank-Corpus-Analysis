— U Thant, Secretary-General of .
the United Nations, in a message y
to the Inaugural Meeting of the
Bank’s Board of Governors,
Tokyo, 24-26 November 1966,

THE BANK opened its doors for business in 1966—a most
difficult period for the region. As the Bank commemorates
the completion of its first ten years of service to the Asian
and South Pacific region, many of the old difficulties have
lingered, with new and perhaps more intractable problems
emerging.

For the first time in three decades, the region is free
from major conflicts; but for millions of people, insecurity
persists at the economic and socia! fevel. This period in the
history of the region could be recorded as a time of
enormous change, marked by the advent and vigorous
growth of a unique Asian institution. Yet, for an organization assigned to: help promote the economic welfare of
over one billion people, including most of the world's
poorest poor, its accomplishments in the past decade can
represent no more than an opening chapter.

The Bank's first ten: years proved to be a time of farreaching changes for the nations, the economies and the
peoples of the region. The period opened in the second
half of the United Nations First Development Decade—a
hopeful time when the growth targets of the Bank's
developing member countries (DMCs}, in general, looked
like being met, or were weil on the way to achievement. It
was a time when fears of global starvation were being
eased by the promise of the so-called ‘Green Revolution” —the first impact of the new high-yieiding foodgrain

varieties-on-the-devetoping-worid-tttoot-a-few-more-years ——has-set_alandmark_in_subregional_cooperation Other reg=_

to reatize that while the new agricultural technology was
producing more food in the fields, it also required levels of
institutional organization—often lacking—in connection
with the supply and distribution of necessary inputs.

The mid-1960s aiso provided the setting for some of the
most distressing military conflicts in Asia in recent history.
The military disputes have since been resolved, but the

economic impact of these prolonged conflicts remains a
burden on the countries involved.

The second half of the decade brought a new set of
problems for DMCs of the region—problems largely
beyond their control. Just as many of these countries were
showing encouraging progress in economic growth and
production, they experienced a severe setback through a
train of adverse developments on the ‘international
economic front. Worldwide inflation, sharp increases in oif
prices, a persistent economic recession in industrialized
countries and worsening terms of trade over the past few
years combined to retard economic and social progress
and to reduce the earlier momentum of growth. War and
natural disasters also took a heavy toll. it is a tribute to the
resilience and growing sense of self-reliance and economic
discipline among the developing nations of the Bank's region that they have not only survived the adversities, but in
some cases have still managed to record substantial progress. :

One significant development from the mixed patterns of
the decade was the increasing recognition in international
forums of the interdependence of nations and the increasing efforts to strengthen the range of cooperation with the
developing countries. The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) linking five potentially rich developing
countries for mutual culturat and economic development

ional initiatives combining developing nations in their first
moves toward preferential trading and currency clearing
arrangements, as well as improved telecommunications,
took shape to help break down the barriers of centuries of
isolation. The Asian Development Bank itself represented
one of these more tangible expressions of regional cooperation, strengthened by international support.Dimensions of the Region

lf we are to shed more than a glimmer
of fight of an area which houses one-third of
the warld s population - or roughty one billion
people - this is merely a beginning. | envision

Bank as a catalyst, supplying the impetus for
the tnttux of new investment funds from
regional and non-regional sources atike .. .~

- President Takeshi Watanabe,
upon his election as the
Bank's First President,
Tokyo, November 1966

President Walanabe’s vision of the Bank's role as an agent
of catalytic change is as relevant today as it was ten years ago.
During the decade, nearly 250 million people were added to
the combined population of the DMCs. In terms of both population and area, these countries comprise the largest sector of
the globe served by a regional development bank. Their 1.2 dillion people include most of the world’s poorest, with per
capita incomes of below $200. While the Bank's DMCs
account for 56 per cent of the population of the developing
world, they receive less than one-fourth of the total external
resource inflow and about one-third of the total official
development assistance — bilateral and multilateral.

Beyond the economic growth problems inherent in this
vast and diverse area of the world, the sheer physical dimensions of the region which the Bank serves are immense. It
extends from Afghanistan in West Asia to the Cook Islands in
the far South Pacific Ocean. The Bank's 25 DMCs have poputations ranging from 600 million down to 18,000. The varying
stages of their economic development are refiected in per
capita incomes ranging from less than $100 a year to more
than $2,500.

Building a Regional Bank

Two special characteristics of the Bank have been among
its principal sources of strength from the beginning. As the
Preamble to the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter) underlines, the Bank's founders saw
the importance of building a “financial institution thatis Asian
in its basic character" to serve the ends of development in the
region. On the other hand, unlike other regionai development
banks established earlier, the Bank shared its membership
from the start with the industrialized countries of Europe and
North America. The Bank has also three regional developed
member countries — Australia, Japan and New Zealand. The
support of non-regiona!l countries has brought resources,
technology and international experience to development projects and programs to reinforce the efforts of the regional
members, both developed and developing. In this sense, the
formation of the Bank marked the beginning of an important
partnership which has matured with time and brought
together human and financial resources of 42 nations in four
continents. It should be recalled, however, that, fromits inception, the Bank has been organized and funded with emphasis
on regional self-reliance. About 63 per cent of the capital is
subscribed by regionai member countries. Furthermore, the
President, eight of the 12 members on the Board of Directors,
and nearly 70 per cent of the professional staff are from the
region.

The formative period of the Bank was necessarily focussed
on administrative, organizational and funding problems. Less
than a month after the Inaugural Meeting of the Board of
Governors was held, the Bank opened its doors on 19
December 1966, and within six months, the Board of Directors
had settied down to the discussion and resolution of a series
of operational! and financial issues. On 24 May 1967, the Bank
approved its first regional technical assistance project, worth
$155,000, for the initial Asian Agricultural Survey — a step that
was to have an enduring influence on Sank lending and technical assistance activities in this crucial sector in the years to
come. A few months later, on 30 August 1967, came the first
technical assistance grant on a national level — to Indonesia,
for foodgrain production studies. On 23 January 1968, the
Bank approved its first loan —$5 million from ordinary capita!
resources — for the Industrial Finance Corporation of Thalland.

The extent of the Bank's impact on the region since those
early days can be measured in various ways — through the
growth of its lending operations and its technical assistance
activities; its success in mobilizing resources; and the various
policies and programs adopted to meet the changing needs
and circumstances of ils OMCs over the first decade This
combination of Sank activities has also generated less
measurable, bul equally significant. economic and social
benefits for the countries of the region 1 serves

Funds for Development

“tf we are to succeed, the rich nations must
increase their support... We were created as
a development institution for poor nations, not
as a middleman for the products and services
of rich ones... We cannot meet our Charter's
commitment to our smatier and less developed
countries unless we open a wide soft-loan
window...”

— President Shiro tnoue, in his
opening address to the Sixth
Annual Meeting of the Bank in
Manila, 26 April 1973.

One measure of the Bank’s growth in staiureis the significant progress that it has made in mobilizing funds for
development from diverse sources. The Bank’s authorized
capital stock rose from $1.3 billion in November 1966 to —
$3.7 billion by the end of 1976. This followed a general
increase in the capital stock of 150 per cent in 1972 and
special capital increases for three regional (Indonesia, Republic of Korea and Malaysia) and two non-regional member
countries (Canada and Federal Republic of Germany}. A second general increase of 135 per cent, approved by the Board
of Governors late in 1976, would bring the authorized capital
stock to $8.7 billion before the end of 1977,

emerged only in more recent years, the Bank took early steps
to have access fo the international capital markets through
regular contacts and progressive completion of bond quaiification formalities in the United States. The first bond issue
was made in the Federal Republic of Germany in September
1969 and, in the following year, the Bank undertook issues in
Austria and Japan. The Japanese issue was something of a

milestone, being the first ever public issue in that country by a
foreign borrower. Tne year 1971 saw ine Bank's first issues in
the United States and Switzerland.

These early approaches have been followed by numerous
other successful issues, thereby firmiy establishing the
Bank's name in the world’s capita! markets, To further
enhance the attractiveness of its bonds, the Bank has a policy
that its borrowings should not exceed the callable capital
stock subscribed by members whose currencies are convertible. The “AAA” status accorded the Bank's bonds and notes in
the United States is indicative of the Bank's creditworthiness.

With the rapid growth of its ordinary lending activities, the
Sank has been relying increasingly on borrowed funds in
recent years. in 1975, for instance, the Bank borrowed $323
million — more than in all the previous years put together; in
4976, a record amount of $529 miilion was borrowed. In all, by
the end of 1976, the Bank had raised more than $1.1 billion in
some 38 borrowing operations.

The Bank's efforts in diversifying the sources of borrowed
funds is reflected in the list of capital markets it has already
tapped: Austria, Belgium, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy,
Japan, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia,
Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and United States. in addition, the central banks or monetary authorities of both regional and non-regional member countries have made shortterm funds available to the Bank, and these are regularly
tolled over.

The Bank's Charter spells oui that it must pay special attention to the needs of the smaller or iess developed countries.
One of the major instruments the Bank has employed in discharging this function has been its Speciai Funds, created
and periodically funded for the specific purpose of concessional lending to the least developed member couniries. For
almost five years, the Bank depended for its concessionallending on contributions made on a bilateral basis at the
initiative of individual donors. The funds were aiso suppiemented — to the limited extent that the Charter permitted
— by capital that the Bank set aside for this purpose. The
terms of the contributions were, however, not uniform and
posed serious administrative problems. With the progressive
increase {n concessiona! lending, it became necessary to
mobilize additional funds on an organized and regular basis.

Following negotiations and agreement between potential
donor countries, the Asian Development Fund (ADF), a new
soft-loan window, was set up in June 1974 with a mobilization
target of $525 million, to finance the Bank's concessional
lending activities ttll the end of 1975. The Bank's funds for
concessional lending have since been almost wholly administered In the ADF.

The Board of Governors passed a resolution in December
1975 covering a proposed replenishment of the ADF totalling
$830 million’ to be provided over a three-year perlod commencing in 1976. The replenishment became effective on 28
June 1876 when total contribution commitments exceeded
the “trigger” figure of $475 million. This resulted in the release
of first instalments, equal to one-third of such total commitments.

At the end of 1976, resources of Special Funds available for
further concessional lending had declined to a low level of
$44.8 million, the Bank having committed $890 million in Special Funds foans (net of cancellations, repayments and
exchange adjustments) out of the totai resources of $931.9
miltion. At the beginning of 1977, the maintenance of the
tempo of Special Funds lending was dependent on the Bank’s
obtaining a timely release on the second instalment of the
contributions pledged.

The Bank has made significant progress, especiaity in
tecent years, in evolving co-financing arrangements with
other donors as an effective way of increasing the flow of
external assistance for relatively large projects in the region.
Aside from traditional aid agencies, OPEC countries and two
commercial banks have figured in such co-financing
arrangements. The Bank has assisted some 18 projects in this
way, the amount of Bank financing involved being $411 million and financing from other sources about $639 million.

The Bank has also been administering a Technical Assistance Special Fund, a major source of finance for its technical
assistance activities. Total contributions to the Fund from 21
member countries — both developed and developing —
amounted to $23.7 million at the end of 1976, of which $12.8
million had been utilized in the Bank's technical assistance
operations. For its technical assistance activities, the Bank
has also received financial assistance from other international
institutions. For instance, out of the total provision of techaical assistance of about $35 million on national and regional
technical assistance projects undertaken by the Bank up to
the end of 1976, the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) financing accounted for $8 miilion. More recently, the
Bank has also entered into a cooperative arrangement with
the European Economic Community (EEC) under which the
latter will provide in 1977 the equivalent of $1,875,000, ona
grant basis, to support the Bank's technical assistance
operations.

Lending for Development

In 1968, its first year of lending activities, the Bank made a
total of seven loans — ail from ordinary capital resources —

+ Subsequently reduced because of various adjustments to $809 million.

totalling $41.6 million. Since then, the range and size of Bank
lending has steadily expanded. By the end of 1976, the Bank's
cumulative lending stood at nearly $3.4 billion for some 264
projects in 23 DMCs. Over a quarter of these funds were
loaned on concessional terms to the most needy of its DMCs.

The Bank's comparative lending figures for the two periods
1968-1972 and 1973-1976 give a clearer view of how rapidly its
operations have expanded, By the end of its formative period
in 1972, the Bank had made 117 loans — 73 from ordinary
capital resources and 44 from Special Funds — totalling $955
militon. But over the next four years from 1973 to 1976, the
Bank added a further 171 loans — 98 from ordinary capital
resources and 73 from Speciat Funds — amounting to more
than $2.4 billion. in 1976 alone, total lending was $776 million,
close to a quarter of the Bank's total loan commitments over
lis ten years. In supporting 264 development projects with
scarce foreign exchange resources, the Bank has played a
vital catalytic role in stimulating capital formation In the regfon. It is estimated that Bank lending, both direct and through
national development banks, would sead to an overall investment of approximately $6 bililon in these projects.

During the ten-year period, 23 DMCs received Bank toans.
While the Bank has no spectflc quotas for lending to individual
countries, two aspects underlined by the Charter are important in determining the volume of the Bank’s fending: avoidance of a disproportionate volume of assistance to any
single DMC and special regard to the needs of the smaller or
less developed DMCs. The actual level of Bank assistance to
each DMC has been influenced by many other factors, including, among others, the external resource gap of the DMC
concerned; its capability to identify, prepare and implement
projects (which the Bank has been making special efforts to
improve through its technical assistance); the eligibility of the
OMC for lending from either ordinary capita! resources or
Special Funds; and the availability of resources to the Bank. in
particular, of Special Funds.

The forward country programming approach, adopted
since the early 1970's, which sets up a more or Jess firm
pipeline of projects for the year ahead, and a tentative list of
projects for the subsequent two years — subject to yearly
review and continual updating — has heiped in improved
planning of the Bank's operations and in enabling it better to
serve the needs of its DMCs, resulting In a more equitable
country distribution of Bank assistance. Loan disbursements,
which are dependent on the progress of project implementation, totalled $1,159 million during the ten-year period, comprising $948 miltion from the ordinary capital resources and
$211 million from Speciaf Funds, Of the total 264 projects
financed by Bank loans, 54 projects had been completed as of
the end of 4976.

Wide Coverage

Within the limits of its financial resources, and the special
needs of its DMCs, the Bank has attempted to promote ailround development through its lending — with increasing
emphasis on combining economic growth with social progress. The broad dimensions of Bank involvement in the more
important sectors in the past ten years can be briefly summarized as follows:

— 35 irrigation and area development projects covering
about 540,100 ha., which support about 583,600 farmers. Total
population expected to benefit — about 3.2 million.

— 13 fisheries development projects which will create
additional employment opportunities for about 27,000SEMPOR Dam merges into

— 6 fertilizer projects which will help increase the region's
fertilizer supplies by 1.6 million tons of nitrogen nutrients and
76,000 tons of phosphate nutrients per annum.

— 1,480 small and medium-scale enterprises assisted
through credit lines to national development banks.

—~ 54 power projects which will help provide additional
installed generating capacity totalling nearly 2.15 million kw,
of which three-fourths will be in the form of cheap hydropower, and add a vast network of transmission and distribution lines totalling over 20,000 km.

— 22 water supply and sewerage projects which will help
increase water supply capacity by 4.9 million cubic meters per
day to 12.5 million cubic meters per day, benefiting a population of nearly 33 million in metropolitan areas, smaller towns

tion facilities in six separate institutes where over 10,000
trainees are now receiving instruction.

Among the economic sectors assisted by the Bank, public
utilities (electric power, natural gas, water supply and sewerage and urban development) have absorbed the largest share
— 33.1 per cent of the Bank’s cumulative lending to 31
December 1976. Next were: agriculture and agro-industry —
23.5 per cent: industry, including development banks — 23
per cent; transport and communications — 19.6 per cent; and
education — 0.8 per cent.

During the ten-year period, the Bank has lent $790 million
for the agriculture and agro-industry sector, of which more
than half has been provided from Special Funds on concessional terms. The major area of Bank assistance has been
irrigation and integrated rural development projects—as the
nuclei of area development around which other development

seed and fertilizer delivery systems, processing and marketing facilities, research and extension services, farmers’
institutions, health clinics and housing are organized. To
complement the drive for greater food production and rural
employment, the Bank has assisted the development of agroindustries, notably fertilizer production. Apart from the fertifizer projects atready mentioned, 15 projects designed todevelop and modernize the fisheries and livestock subsectors have also been supported with Bank loans totalling
$129 million. The Bank has been helping its DMCs to diversify
the agricultural sectors of their economies by financing modernization and development projects covering commerciat
crops such as tea, paim oil, rubber, jute and sugarcane. The
Bank's role in assisting agricultural research work in the region has progressively expanded. Bank assistance in this field
has been mainly in the form of direct grants to research
institutlons and the incorporation of research facilities and
programs as integral parts of agricultural projects.

Bank lending for industry {including development banks),
totalting more than $772 million over the decade, has included
some 36 credlt lines amounting to about $590 million to
development finance institutions (DFls} for relending to smail
and medium-scale industries In DMCs — projects not large
enough to warrant direct flnancing by the Bank itself.
Activities supported through credit ilnes include food processing, transportation, producilon of textiles, chemicals, lime,
cement and prefabrication materials, iron and steel, metai and
wire products, paper and paperboard, among others. in addi-~
tion, the Bank has made direct loans to large projects such as
petrochemicals, cement, textiles, machinery and minerals.

The public utilities sector accounted for more than $1.1
billion of Bank lending during the decade. About 21 per cent
of total Bank fending ($711 million) has been devoted to the
development of power systems. Several loans have been
made to strengthen and expand generation, transmission and
distribution facilities serving major urban centers such as
Bangkok, Karachi, Dacca, Rangoon and Singapore. The Bank

has also financed major geographical extensions of existing _

systems to bring electric energy to the smaller towns and rural
areas. Following the global Increases in petroleum prices
since late 1973, the emphasts of Bank assistance in this field
has been on hydropower ahd other plants using locally available fuels such as gas, coal or lignite, Apart from meeting
increased commercial and industrial demand, the Bank's
lending to the water supply sector is helping to improve the
quality of life of millions of people in the region’s fast-growing
cities and towns. In Bank-assisted water supply systems serving crowded centers such as Seoul and Manila, measures fo
deal with environmental poliution are given appropriate attention. More recently, the Bank has entered other sectors of
social significance, such as sewerage development, either
integrated into water supply projects or as separate projects,
and urban development.

in the transport and communications sector, which has
absorbed $658 million of total Bank lending in the ten-year
period, a multi-disciplinary approach has been adopted to
make sure that individual projects fit into the wider economic
and social framework of the country. Emphasis has been
placed on the construction and improvement of road and
feeder-road networks for facilitating area development and
reducing regional disparities. Facilities in 16 ports and seven
airports are being expanded and improved to meet the grow~ing requirements of internal and external trade and to promote tourism development. The Bank has also financed two
projects in the field of railway development and rehabilitation.
In addition, $15 million of Bank financing has been provided
for telecommunications projects.

Bank lending for education, standing at $27.6 million, has
been relatively modest. Tne Bank has concentrated on technical and vocational education and on training programs particularly aimed at assisting project authorities to implement

and operate Bank projects successfully. The Bank has so far
financed four vocational education projects in Indonesia,
Republic of Korea, Singapore and Thailand. On-the-job training of local personnei has also been a built-in feature of more
than 70 Bank projects. Vigorous efforts to expand the Banks s
activity in this sector are under way.

Technical Assistance

An important aspect of the Bank's developmentat role is its
program of technical assistance to DMCs and for regional
projects and programs. By the end of 1976, the Bank had been
involved In a total of 214 national and regional technical assistance projects, While the outiay on technical assistance represenis only about one per cent of Bank lending to the region,
Its Impact on development cannot be measured in these
terms. Many of the Bank’s DMCs need substantial injections
of technical know-how and expertise to strengthen their own
capability to produce national and sectoral development
plans and policles, to identify, prepare and implement projects on their own, and to establish and strengthen focal
development institutions. This role of helping its borrowers —
member countries and their agencies — to help themselves is
a@ basic function of the Bank. Advisory and operational technical assistance provides for the establishment and strengthening of national institutions which are receiving, or expect to
receive, Bank loans. It also covers specialized training of local
personnel, the improvement of financial and accounting systems in the executing agencies and assistance in drawing up
national development plans, as well as sectoral strategies and
programs. In many cases, technical assistance has been
approved, mostly on a grant basis, for the careful preparation
of projects and has led on to substantial financing by the
Bank, particularly for projects in its poorest and least
developed member countries. Some 76 Bank loans totalling
$937 million are the direct result of technical assistance provided by the Bank.

At the tevel of technical assistance to individual member
countries, the Bank's aid has gone to some 22 DMCs over the
years. By far the largest proportion, about 45 per cent has
gone to technical assistance projects in the fieid of agriculture
and agro-industry. The other categories have been as follows:
public utilities — 22.5 per cent, transport and communications — 19.1 per cent; industry, including development banks
— 9 per cent; and education and others — 4 per cent.

The Bank’s regional technical assistance activities during
the past ten years — costing more than $6.5 million — have
involved, in specific cases, cooperation with UNDP, and other
international and bilateral aid agencies. The program of some
36 regional projects has included two major surveys on Asian
agriculture, a regional transport survey for Southeast Asia, a
study of Southeast Asia's economy, several regional conferences of DFls, as well as many seminars and training courses
in key areas of development, aimed at upgrading national
capacities to absorb aid and building up the “human
resources" of institutions in DMCs. in anew role, the Bank has
also been involved as administrator of the funds for the Nam
Ngum Hydropower Project (Phase Il) in the Lao People's
Democratic Republic and as coordinator of project execution.

Organizational Structure & Operational Policies

Based on experience and the need to respond more effectively to the changing needs of DMCs, the Bank's organizational structure and operational policies have been under
constant review and streamlined as necessary.CONSTRUCTION work in progress at Malaysia’s first deep-water seaport on its east coast, about 16 miles north of Kuantan, capital
of Pahang State,

To facilitate better representation of the Bank's growing
membership, the strength of the Board of Directors was
increased from 10 to 12 in 1971. The operational departments
have been periodically reorganized and their functions redefined to facilitate prompt and efficient handling of the entire
range of activities from identification and appraisal of projects
to supervision of implementation and loan administration

The operational policies of the Bank, which are laid down
by the Board of Directors, mainly in the nature of guidelines,
and are subject to constant review, cover a wide field. They
include lending terms, criteria for lending from Special Funds,
policies and procedures governing assistance to development banks, the Bank's activities in its South Pacific member
countries, local cost financing, procurement of goods and
services, uses of consultants and post-evaluation, besides
financial policies.

in terms of the criteria iaid down by the Board of Directors
in September 1974, the eligibility of a DMC for concessional
loans is determined primarily on the basis of the country's
economic situation. Generally speaking, countries with per
capita GNP in 1972 exceeding $300 are not regarded as being
eligible for concessional loans. Along with per capita GNP, a

ment is also taken into account in determining its eligibility.

In practice, because of the limited availability of Special
Funds, an overwhelming bulk of concessional lending in
recent years has gone to countries with per capita incomes of
$150 and less. indonesia, the largest borrower from Special
Funds in the earlier years, has been borrowing on ordinary

terms since 1974 because of its improved balance-of-payments position resulting from increased oi! revenues.

The Bank also provides blended loans from its Special
Funds and ordinary capital resources — both on a country (as
in the case of Pakistan) and on a project basis. Such financing
is considered case by case.

in the first five years of its operations, the lending rate on

‘ ordinary loans of the Bank was comparatively stable, chang
ing from the original 6.875 to 7.50 per cent per annum in May
1970 and remaining at that level until September 1974. Thereafter, inresponse to the Bank's growing need to borrow in the
capital markets for its lending operations, the rate changed
rather frequently— to 8.25 per cent in September 1974, to 8.75
per cent in February 1975, to 9.10 per cent in June 1976, and
downward to 8.90 percent in October 1976. For DMCs with per
capita incomes exceeding $850 at the end of 1972, higher
lending rates have been in effect since February 1975. The
Bank also levies a commitment charge on the undisbursed
portion of all ordinary loans, which is currently 0.45 per cent
per annum.

The amortization periods of ordinary loans have ranged
from 10 to 30 years (including a grace period of 2 to 7 years),

———<ouniy-s_presentand-_prospestive capacity fordebt-+epay_—_depending-mainly-enthenatareof-projects-oitheirgesiation

period.

Until early 1974, the terms of Special Funds loans, although
much more concessional than ordinary loans, had varied
according to project and country considerations’. Such varying terms had unduly encumbered loan processing and loan

1 Interest rates ranged ‘rom 1 to 3 per cent end amortization from 12 to 40
years (inclucing a grace period of from 3 to 1G years)10

administration. In the interest of simplicity and efficiency, the
terms of Special Funds loans were standardized in March
1974. Such loans now carry only a service charge of 1 percent
per annum, with repayment over 40 years, including a 10-year
grace period,

Unill mid-1974, Bank loans had been provided to finance
only the forelgn exchange costs of projects, including in
appropriate cases, indirect foreign exchange costs. Since
July 1974, the Bank has been financing, in suitable cases, a
reasonable proportion of the local currency expenditures of
projects by lending foreign exchange for this purpose. In
considering focal cost financing, the Bank places primary
emphasis on the country’s economic situation, particularly its
overall balance-of-payments position and its capability to
mobilize domestic savings. Within eligible countries, preference is given to those projects with low foreign exchange
components, or high economic or social benefits, For the present, such financing is limited to a maximum of 5 per cent of
the Bank's annual lending from ordinary capital resources
and 10 per cent of its annual lending from Special Funds’

The Bank is enjoined by its Charter to ensure that the
proceeds of any loan it makes are used with due attention to
considerations of economy and efficiency. Accordingly, the
Bank has required its borrowers to obtain goods and services
on an international competitive tendering basis, except in
special circumstances where a procedure determined to be
more appropriate to the circumstances of the project or country concerned has been agreed upon between the Bank and
the borrower. In this light, detailed guidslines for the procurement of goods and construction services and the use of
consultants were adopted in 1968 and subsequently revised in
May 1973,

In recognition of the growth of domestic industries in
DMCs, certain policy measures were adopted in July 1976 to
promote domestic procurement under Bank-financed projects. (See page 23.)

The Bank has, from the early years of its operations, recognized the importance of post-evaluation as a tool for learning
fram experience with a view to improving its future lending
operations. Post-evatuation of a development project, conducted after a project is completed and has been in operation
for some time, is usually designed in such a way as to assess
not only its achievements vis-a-vis its stated objectives but
also the effectiveness and efficiency of its implementation, as
well as the contribution of the project to the overall socioeconomic development of the country concerned. Since 1974,
systematic efforts have been made towards developing and
carrying out, a comprehensive program of post-evaluation in
the Bank. For objective assessment, post-evaluation studies
are carsied out internally by Bank staff who are independent of
the Bank's operating departments, frequently with the assistance of outside consultants, or externally by academic and
research institutions which are also independent of Bank's
management.

Development Initiatives

Throughout the past ten years the Bank has attempted to be
as flexible as possible in adapting its activities in line with
development priorities and initiatives that are appropriate to
the special needs and changing economic circumstances of
DMCs.

In view of the serious balance-of-payments problems and
heavy debt burdens faced by DMCs in recent years, the Bank
has been devoting special! attention to the identification and

financing of projects which would help reduce imports of
food, fertilizer and fuel and facilitate arger exports through
the development of additional agricultural and industrial pro-"
duction capacity.

Another important aspect of Bank lending has been the
efforts it has made to raise the productivity of existing
facilities. Aside from its substantial assistance to the creation
of new facilities in the infrastructure, agriculture, public
utilities and industrial sectors, the Bank has given several
loans for the rehabilitation of existing power plants and factaries and for upgrading the quality of plantation products
such as tea, jute and palm oii. Projects designed to facilitate
improved transmission and distribution of available power
output, technical assistance for Institutional improvement,
including financlai and managerial aspects, and the priority
given to vocational education and on-the-job training are
some of the other instances of the Bank's emphasis on productivity.

in the traditionally difficult area of agricultural development, the Bank has been building more and more components into its irrigation and rural development projects to
ensure better economic results and wider social impact. As
part of this integrated area development approach, irrigation
and traditional supporting facilities are supplemented by such
diverse elements as pilot schemes for rural industries and
rural education, provision for organization of rural women
and youth through selected economic activities and facilities
for improvement of health and family planning services.

Similarly, in area development projects, the Bank has
financed a series of individual projects, which are essentially
parts of a composite scheme to develop the area as a whole.
Agricultural development, in such cases, is complemented by
road construction, power supply, and institutional and infrastructural inputs.

The Bank's involvement in the promotion of smal! and
medium-scale industries through its development bank jending reflects its concern with the economic and social priorities
of its OMCs. Bank loans and technical assistance to national
development banks play a catalytic role in creating additional
employment and technical skills, in promoting domestic and
foreign private capital investments in productive enterprises
and in familiarizing the business community with modern
concepts of corporate management.

In an effort to enhance the overall impact of the projects
that it finances, the Bank has been devoting increased attention to their social aspects, without sacrificing its concern for
economic features. The special needs of smail farmers, the
supply of water, power and other amenities to low income
groups, pollution contral, the provision of family planning and
health services, ways of maximizing employment potential —
these are some of the factors which figure in Bank projects
from the stage of formulation and evaluation through to their
implementation.

The Bank has also attempted in its Project activities to
promote, both directly and indirectly, the development of
appropriate technology in its DMCs. The choice, in some
cases, of labor-intensive methods in road and port construction projects, the selection of relatively simple designs and
equipment for railway projects, and modifications in design
characteristics of water supply projects to suit local conditions are typical examples of efforts made — within the limits
of economic viability — to promote a level of technology that
is most appropriate to the circumstances in the developing
couniry concerned.Towards the Second Decade

“We have, | believe, made a distinct impact
on the region's economic progress by
extending loans, which in the words of the
Bank’s first President, combine wisdom with
money, We have set higher targets for the
future — an average lending of nearly $3
mitfion a day in the second half of this decade
(against an average of $1 million a day in the
first haif) — and initiated vigorous action to
raise the necessary funds. .. What we have
achieved so far and planned for the immediate
future, creditable as it is, represents only a
modest beginning in our long, uphill task, The
Bank's accomplishments in the past should
not, in any case, lead us into a sense of
complacency..."

~ President Taroichi Yoshida, in
an address io the members of
the Board of Directors and
staff of the Bank,
17 December 1976.

The Bank has set its sights higher as it moves into the
second decade of operations.

Taking into account potential constraints in raising additional resources, the Bank has projected total jending of
about $5.7 biflion during the period 1977-1981 ‘If this targetis
achieved, Bank lending to the region over the next five years
would be about70 per cent greater than its total achievement
during the first decade. Yet, in terms of the large needs of the
region and the diminishing purchasing power of each aid
dollar, it represents only a modest program for the future.

While the task of raising these resources will be by no
means easy, the groundwork has been laid foliowing the
recent approval of a further increase in the Bank's subscribed
capital, to become effective before the end of 1977, and the

replenishment of the ADF, now in progress.

The projected capital increase, which. will substantiaily
increase the Bank's borrowing capacity, and the Bank’s success in raising funds from the capital markets in Europe, the
United States, Japan and the Middie East in the past,
strengthen the hope that the proposed level of fending fram its
ordinary capital resources will be attained.

There is aiso great future potential in co-financing
arrangements and the development of cooperation with
important new sources of aid flows to the region. The list of
traditional participants in co-financing and cooperative
arrangemenis has been progressively expanding with the
entry of other developed countries, OPEC nations, EEC and
commercial banks.

The Bank has aiso established ciose relations with new
international development finance institutions such as the
islamic Development Bank and the Arab Fund for Economic
and Social Development. The expansion of the OPEC Special
Fund for countries most seriously affected by the increase in
oil prices, and the newly-formed International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD) also offer potential for future
fields of cooperation in mobilizing new resources for the
developing countries of the region.

The Bank's overali success in fulfilling its lending program
will, however, depend on its ability to help the poorest and
least developed countries, which cannot afford the burden of
conventional loans. The Bank's first decade has ended with
uncommitted Special Funds resources at a low level pending
release of the second instalment payments under the
agreed replenishment program.

The Bank enters its second decade of service to its DMCs
with a creditable record of performance to date and a sense of
confidence, fiowing from that record, in meeting the greater
challenges of the future. It is a task that can proceed apace
only with the continued goodwill and firm support of all its 42
member countries.

LeECONOMIC BACKGROUND

International Setting

DURING 1976, the world economy recovered from some of the
economic setbacks of the previous two years. Most countries
experienced an increase in real income and a decline in the
rate of inflation. World trade increased significantly. Foodgrain production exceeded the record level achieved in 1975,
although global stocks remained low.

{t is estimated that Gross National Product (GNP), in reat
terms, of the industrial countries which are members of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
{QECD), increased by an average of nearly 5 per cent in 1976
compared with a decline in GNP of 1.2 per cent in 1975. The
GNP growth rate in the first half of 1976 was at an annuat rate
of 6 per cent but fell sharply to 3.25 per cent in the second half.
The level of unemployment continued to be high. The rate of
inflation declined in most OECD countries during 1976,
although it still remained high, averaging 8 per cent. The
economic recovery and the expansionary policies adopted by
several industrial countries led to a large increase in their
imports, which contributed to the recovery in production and
exports of developing countries.

The oil-exporting (OPEC) developing countries experienced high growth rates while their aggregate trade surplus
increased from about $52 billion in 1975 to an estimated $61
billion in 1976. Over half of this surplus was concentrated in
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates — countries having limited capacity to absorb additional imports.
Other major OPEC countries, except Iran, also experienced
larger trade surpluses than in 1975.

Taken together, the non-oil developing countries made
significant progress in 1976; their GNP growth rate is
expected to have improved significantly from about 4 per cent
achieved in 1975, while their aggregate current account
deficit declined from $49 billion in 1975 to $41 billion in 1976,"
The vaiue of their exports increased by an estimated 13 per
centin 1976, stimulated by the improved economic conditions

prices of many key exports of the non-oil developing countries increased, in varying degree, during the year. There were
exceptions, such as jute, sugar, phosphates and rice, the
prices of which either remained depressed or declined substantially. However, in general, the steep fail in the terms of
trade of non-oil developing countries was halted in 1976.

The capital flow to the non-oil developing countries is estimated to have declined by $2 billion to around $43 billion? in
1976 — largely due to a reduction in net Euro-currency borrowings. However, a greater reduction in their current
account deficits enabled them to add to their external
reserves during 1976, in contrast to 1975 when they were
forced to draw down their reserves to meet their external
liabilities.

The immediate prospects of the non-oil developing
countries remained uncertain. Among the positive factors,
the non-oil developing countries largely succeeded in making short-term financial adjustments to the adverse
economic events of the past few years and in initiating
long-term institutional and structural changes. However,
prospects for the external sector were causing concern by
year-end. External debts continued to mount and current
account deficits were still very large. The slowdown in production and growth observed in industrial countries in the
second half of the year and the 5 to 10 per cent increase in
the price of oit by OPEC countries announced in December
4976, could dampen the economic growth prospects of
non-oil developing countries and also worsen their already
difficult balance-of-payments position.

Economic Developments in the Region

in terms of overall economic performance, the developing
member countries (DMCs) of the Bank generally made sig
nificant gains in 1976, The major economic indicators includ- ~

ing growth in output, balance of payments, and domestic
price levels attest to the improved performance.

the fst halt of 1976 — particularly in Japan and the United
States, which are mayor trading partners of several countries
in the region — stimulated the exports and eased the
balance-of-payments constraints on economic growih of the
OMCs. The high level of foedgrain production achieved in
1975 continued in 1976 and this led to both a better food ba!ance for the region and some reduction in imports and prices
of foodgrains. While favorable developments in the international economy played an important role, the basic resilience
and the internal efforts to adjust to the altered international
situation also contributed significantly to the improved
economic siluation in the DMCs.

Table 1' provides preliminary data on [he growth rale of
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 13 DMCs, which indicate
that real growth rates in 11 of these DMCs improved in
1976. For many of these countries, the growth rate was
above the average recorded during 1965-1973, which was a
very successful period of development among these countries, The performance of the more industrialized DMCs,
namely, Republic of China, Hong Kong. Republic of Korea
and Singapore, which in 1975 had suffered severely from
the recession in industrialized countries, was particularly
impressive. The two countries in which the GOP growth
rate was lower in 1976 were the Philippines and Sri Lanka.
The marginal dectine in the former was largely due to a
slowdown in construction activity, while in the latier it was
due to drought which affected agricultural production. For
other DMCs, the indications are that, with the exception of
India and some South Pacific countries, economic growth
in 1976 was also higher than in 1975. Although industrial
production in India has been growing at an annual rate of
about 10 per cent, its overail economic growth in 1976 is
likely to falf substantially below the increase of 8,8 per cent
achieved in 1975, due mainly to the failure of the agricultural sector to show much, if any, improvement. The sharp
fall in prices of sugar in Fiji and phosphate in Gilbert
Islands suggests that these countries recorded tow or
negative GDP growth rates in 1976. Heavy dependence on
a few commodities makes these and other South Pacific
countries highly vulnerable to external influences.

In general, both the agricultural and the industrial sectors
contributed to the higher overall growth in GDP of the DMCs
during 1976. In the case of the less industrialized DMCs, greater emphasis on agricultural production, and fuller utilization
of domestic industria! capacities, contributed to the
improvement. National efforts in terms of greater and more
effective use of modern agricultural facilities and practices
contributed. considerably to the improved performance in
agriculture, although the weather is stil! the crucial factor
underlying the increase in agricultural production. The high
growth rates achieved by the industrialized DMCs stemmed
from a large increase in their exports, resulting from the
revived demand for their manufactures in developed countries. The existence of substantial underutilized industrial
capacity and high stocks enabled these countries to take
quick advantage of this revival of demand, while the prices
they secured for their exports were also generally higher than
in 1975.

One of the most encouraging features of 1976 was the high
level of foodgrains production. !n aggregate, the output of
rice, wheat and maize — the region's three major foodgrains

1 Tables relevant to this chapter are in the Stalistical Annex at pages 58 to
65.

— is estimated at 224 million tons, compared with 220 million
tons in 1975 and 196 million tons in 1974, The substantial
improvement in production since 1974 has greatly reduced
the dependence of the region on food imports and contributed to the reduction in the rates of inflation.

Output of nce in the region, the main staple of most DMCs,
increased by 13.8 percent in 1975 loreach a record level of 167
million tons. Production of rice in 1976 is estimated to be marginally lower at 166 million tons, due to an anticipated shortfall of 4 million tons in India resulting from drought in certain
areas {Table 2} However, two consecutive good years, of
food produchion—including grains olher than sce--have
enabled India to achieve unprecedentedly high levels of
foodgrain reserves

The output of wheat and maize in the DMCs was higher
in 1976. Total production of wheat, the second most important staple of the region, is estimated to have increased by
5 million tons over 1975 to reach a record level of 40 million
tons, The output of maize is estimated at 18 3 million tons in
1976, compared with 18.1 million tons in 1975 (Table 3).

Inflation, which contributed to the erosion of both
investment and savings since 1973, was reduced considerably during 1976. In the 22 DMCs for which data are available, the index of consumer prices increased by an average of 7.1 per cent, which was lower than the increase
experienced by the OECD countries (Table 4). in 11 of
these DMCs, the rate of increase in the price level was 5
per cent or less, Among the countries which had high rates
of inflation, only three countries experienced an increase
over 1975: Cook Isiands from 16 per cent to 23 per cent,
Gilbert Isiands from 9 per cent to 13 per cent and Indonesia
from 19 per cent to 20 per cent. The other DMCs which continued to experience double-digit rates of inflation, albeit at
lower rates than in 1975, were Burma, Fiji, Republic of Korea
and Pakistan.

The overail balance-of-payments situation of the DMCs,
although still adverse compared with the pre-1974 period,
improved greatly in 1976. The aggregate trade deficit of 18
DMCs {excluding Afghanistan, Cambodia, Cook Islands, Gilbert Islands, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Solomon
islands and Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, for which data are
not available) is estimated at $5.3 billion for 1976, compared with $12.7 billion in 1975 (Table 5). Both an impressive export performance and a slow growth in imports conUributed to this much-reduced trade deficit.

Export receipts increased in most of the larger DMCs
during 1976, Aggregate export earnings of the 18 DMCs for
which data are available increased by 30.4 per cent from
$42 billion in 1975 to $55 billion. In the case of the four
more industrialized OMCs previously mentioned, export
earnings increased by 39.8 per cent in 1976, while in the
remaining 14 countries the increase averaged 19.9 per
cent. Only three of these countries, namely Fiji, Sri Lanka
and Tonga, reported fower export earnings.

Aggregate import payments of the 18 DMCs increased
by 9.9 per cent from $55 billion in 1975 to $59 billion in
4976. For the four more industrialized DMCs, the increase
in imports was 21.3 per cent, while in the remaining 14
countries imports on average declined by 2.0 per cent.
Thus, the countries which showed a rapid increase in
exports also showed a high increase in imports. Among the
less industrialized DMCs, the major factor accounting for
the reduced level of imports was a fall in both the quantity
and value of food imports. india contributed most to this
decline, as its imports declined by 11.9 per cent from $6.14- fures are available, it is sstinrated that _11-DM

billion in 1975 to an estimated $5.40 billion in 1976.

Both the volume and unit prices for many of the DMCs'
exports were generally higher during 1876 compared with
the previous year. However, the prices of sugar, rock
phosphate and jute fell considerably during the year, causing severe balance-of-paymenis problems for those DMCs
which predominantly depend on the export of one or more
of these commodities. The terms of trade data available for
ten larger DMCs show that six countries had improved
terms of trade in 1976 compared to 1975, while four countries recorded a worsening of their terms of trade.

The sizeable reduction of their current account deficits
and continued large net flow of external resources both
from official and private sources together contributed to
the build-up of international reserves by the DMCs. The
total reserves of 18 DMCs for which data are available
increased from $13.5 billion at the end of 1975 to $20.0 billion by the end of 1976. The most significant gains were
made by India, indonesia, Republic of Korea and Malaysia
(Table 6). This helped some DMCs to replenish their precariously low international reserves and contributed to an
improvement in the credit rating of some of those which
significantly relied on loans from commercial sources. The
declining trend in the ratio of international reserves to the
region's imports observed during the preceding two years
was reversed during 1976.

The farge deficits in the current account of the DMCs in
1974 and 1975 lec to a rapid increase in their external debt. A
complete picture of the outstanding debt of the DMCsin 1976
is not available. However, the magnitude of the problem can
be assessed from the fact that the aggregate external public
debt alone increased from $38.2 billion in 1973 to $48.7 billion
in 1974 and further to $54.5 billion in 1975 (Table 7). A further
increase of about $6 billion is anticipated in 1976. Debt service,
payments increased from $2.6 billion in 1974 to $3.2 billion in
1975. It appears that the increase in debt service payments in
1976 is likely to be roughly of the same order of magnitude as
tecorded in 1975. Given the large increase in exports, the debt
service ratio in 1976 for the region as a whole could be
expected to be lower than that in 1975, although in some
DMCs, this ratio is likely to have increased further.
Domestic Efforts and Policies

During 1976, the economic policies pursued by the DMCs
varied depending on the major areas of concern to individual
countries. In general, the DMCs continued to emphasize price
stability, sustained economic growth, agricultural and rural
development, population control, higher utilization of industrial capacity, improvement in the balance of payments and
regional cooperation. Trade policies sought to improve
export performance and reduce the growth of imports.

Despite the efforts made by several DMCs to achieve better
balance between government expenditures and revenues during 1976 than in the previous two years, the DNGCs as a whole
had to rely more heavily on budgetary deficits to meet their
rapidly expanding current and investment expenditures.

Of the 17 DMCs for which data on revenues and expendiincreased their budgetary deficits or had lower surpluses
duting 1976. In some of the remaining six DMCs the
deficits were only marginally lower than in 1975, However,
many DMCs were able to allocate a much higher proportion than in previous years of overall budgetary expenditures for development purposes. This was done partly to
offset the low level of private investment which continued

fo prevail in many DMCs.

On the whole, the monetary policies pursued by the
DMCs led to a dampening of the high rates of inflation
which had prevailed since 1973. Interest rates were generally kept high to encourage savings and fimit credit expansion. However, the monetary policies pursued varied from
country to country depending upon their individual circumstances. The rate of monetary expansion was curtailed
during the, year in two DMCs (Burma and Indonesia) in
view of the continued high rates of inflation in these countries. Some DMCs reduced the growth in their money supply further despite improvements in the price situation,
while other DMCs adopted expansionary monetary policies
in the context of better economic performance during the
year. The easing of monetary controls in some DMCs
would have needed careful monitoring since their rates of
inflation, although lower than in 1975, continued to be
high.

To reduce the high level of external trade deficits reached
during 1975 and the onerous burden of financing such large
deficits, the DMCs made vigorous efforts to improve their
export performance and reduce non-essential imports. The
reduction in import dependence in many DMCs during 1976
was made possible by greater domestic efforts to utilize local
resources in meeting food and energy requirements and continued stress on the need for economizing in the use of foreign
exchange resources. Restrictive domestic monetary policies
were relaxed in some cases in favor of export industries and
exporters. Some DMCs introduced tax exemptions on export
incomes and reduced export duties. The lower rates of inflation during the year in many DMCs, compared with the price
increases experienced by their major trading partners, helped
to strengthen their currencies and the competitiveness of
their export products.

Several DMCs announced policy measures to encourage
foreign private investment, particularly a number of countries
in South Asia which have failed to attract substantial direct
foreign Investment in recent years. Special incentives were
provided to encourage domestic resource-based and
export-oriented industries, with a view to improving the position in the external sector.

The DMCs generally emphasized the need for achieving
self-sufficiency in food. The success in this respect is indicated by the large increases in output of foodgrains, which
resulted from better weather, but even more importantly from
the deliberate efforts and incentives provided by the governments concerned. Some DMCs also took steps during the year
to build up significant buffer stocks of foodgrains, both to
maintain domestic price levels as incentives to farmers and
also to provide security against-future shortfalis, There was
also greater realization that, in the long run, the objective
of self-sufficiency in food could be achieved only by bringing down the high rates of population growth. This was
teflected in more effective population policies. Several
DMCs including Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Philippines, which have been experiencing high rates of popula
tion growth, substantially expanded the size of their family

planning programs. A few DMCs such as Republic of China, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Sri Lanka achieved
substantial success in reducing their population growth
rates.

At the regional fevel, DMCs generally strengthened existing
institutions concerned with regional cooperation. Subregional groups such as the Regional Cooperation for

1718

Development (RCD) and the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) made considerable progress during 1976
in attempts to coordinate the development efforts of participating countries. The Asian Clearing Union expanded its
efforts to promote increased monetary cooperation as a
means of increasing intra-regional trade. Some DMCs
imptemented schemes of mutual preferential tariff cuts during the year. The purpose of all the measures was to promote greater self-reliance within the region and closer
cooperation to achieve higher growth rates in the participating countries,

The poticies adopted by the DMCs in response to their
economic difficulties since 1973, together with the favorable international developments of 1976, significantly altered
their economic situation; the pessimistic outlook prevailing
in 1975 gave way, at least in some countries, to a measure
of self-assurance and optimism. However, there seems to
be no cause for comptacency. As indicated earlier, the
improved growth rates achieved during the year were generally the result of fuller utilization of existing capacity
facilitated by a recovery of export demand and good harvesis, resuiting largely from generally favorable weather.

Growth prospects in the longer term depend mainly on the
ability of the DMCs to increase the rate of capital formation. In
this respect, the continued low rate of domestic savings in
many DMCs — and in some cases actual decline — is a major
obstacle to growth, requiring urgent attention. Further, the
investment needs for maintaining a satisfactory rate of growth
have increased in recent years in view of the large increases in
the prices of many investment goods. Thus, much greater
efforts in the mobilization of domestic savings and a greater
inflow of external resources will be called for, if the growth

‘momentum of the OMCs is to be sustained.

Developments In International Cooperation

The international community remained responsive to the
needs of the DMCs for external resources during 1976. The net
current account deficit of the OMCs during 1976, after aliowing for a net deficit in services and private transfers, is estimated at $6.4 billion ($13.7 billion in 1975). At the same
time, the region was able to add about $6.5 billion to its
international reserves, This would suggest that the net
inflow of external resources to the region was of the order
of $12.9 billion in 1976 compared with $12.7 billion in
1975.’

Official assistance from DAC countries and multilateral
institutions in 1976 was probably somewhat higher than
the 1975 level of $6.4 billion, Net disbursements of OPEC
assistance are also likely to have exceeded the estimated
level of $6.6 biition in 1975. Net IMF drawings by the DMCs
were $0.7 billion in 1975, but declined to half this level
in 1976, largely due to heavy repayments by a few DMCs.
Borrowings on the international capital markets, private
investment flows, and export credits and other short-term
borrowings totalled $5 billion in 1975. These flows during
1976 are estimated to have been higher on a gross basis,
but lower on a net basis, than in 1975.

Bue to the much slower growth in the flow of concessional
funds in relation to the rapid increase in the external resource
requirements of the region, the share of Official Development

of a countrywise breakdown in this intlow. However, due to lack of dala,

the figures here and in Table € do not include tows from centrally planned
economies

Assistance in the total inflows of external resources to the
DMCs declined sharply from 64 per centin 1970 to 32 per cent
in 1975. Severa! important measures were initiated or
implemented during 1976 which either contributed to or may
hetp increase the volume of concessional flows to DMCs in the
future. First, the OPEC Special Fund was established with
total resources of $800 million, of which $400 million was
earmarked for the Internationat Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD) and $200 million for concessional assistance to 45 needy developing countries of which the major
recipients include Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. Second,
IFAD, which achieved its $1 billion capitalization target in
December 3976, was due to begin operations in early 1977.
Third, a Trust Fund was established by the IMF in May
from the proceeds of its gold auctions to provide special
balance-ol-payments support for eligible developing countries at concessional terms. Fourth, the IMF Compensatory
Financing Facility, designed to help countries experiencing
severe export fluctuations, was expanded in 1976. And
fifth, the ‘third window” of the IBRD, which became operational in December 1975, was used heavily in 1976: the
commitments to countries in the ADB region were $295
million.

While the ftow of aid and the concessional nature of that
flow are especially important to the poorer DMCs, access
to commercial credit and borrowing at market or nearmarket rates of interest from developed countries and multilateral institutions are particularly important to the relatively better-off DMCs. Many of these countries were able
to borrow substantial amounts during 1976, which in gross
terms could exceed the level achieved in the previous twa
years. In order to expand the supply of loans on market
terms, multilateral institutions, including the Bank,
expanded their operations further by borrowing large
amounts in the capital markets and also by entering into
co-financing arrangements with commercial! banks as well
as with other official aid institutions. in addition, the
Development Committee? of the World Bank and the IMF
has requested the World Bank to study the proposal to
establish an International Resources Bank with the
intended purpose of supporting efforts of developing countries to exploit their natural resources.

During 1976, the developing countries continued to place
great emphasis on expansion in merchandise trade as a vehicie of economic growth. They continued to express their concern for obtaining stable and equitable prices for their
exports, for reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers currently
facing their export products, and for diversifying their exports
by product and by destination. At the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) meeting in
Nairobi in May 1976, it was generally agreed that efforts must
be made to achieve stable and equitable prices of primary
commodities. Some progress is being made on specific
agreements which shouid improve the operations of commodity markets to the advantage of both developing and
industrial countries.

In addition to the UNCTAD meeting in Nairobi, a series of
meetings at the highest levels took piace during the year.
These inciude the Jamaica Conference on world monetary
issues, which convened in January 1976, several meetings of
the Development Committee, and the Conference on International Economic Cooperation (CIEC) or “north-south dia
2 Joint Ministerial Committee of the Boards of Governors of Ihe Bank and
the Fund on the Transfer of Real Resources to Developing Countnes.logue” meetings in Paris. At these meetings, many crucial!
issues were discussed to help achieve a more stable and
equitable international economic order in an increasingly
interdependent world. Considerable attention was devoted to
discussion of a variety of measures which would channel
more real resources to the developing countries in the
general context of a restructured global economy.

Although the “financial crisis" atmosphere occasioned by
unprecendented balance-of-payments deficits in developing
countries had dissipated somewhat, the problem of financing
development through adequate inflows of external resources
and meeting debt service burdens will continue to remain
major areas of concern to developing countries in the coming
years. However, both in the Bank's region and throughout the
developing world, the emphasis of discussion on development in 1976 shifted from financial and short-run considerations to long-run institutional and structural problems.

Developing countries are raising new issues and are voicing new concerns. More and more, they are emphasizing
the social aspects of development and the primary role of
appropriate technology. In the Bank’s region, governments
are stressing the welfare of the masses living in rura! areas
and of the poorer sections of the urban population; they

are according higher priorities to the creation of more job
opportunities and to the increased production of food and
other agricultural products. in order to deai with these
concerns effectively, necessary institutional changes must
be made, These changes require determined and sustained
efforts by the developing countries, the cooperation of the
developed countries, and increasing inflows of external
resources from official and private sources and international financial institutions.

‘The Bank took a variety of measures during the year to
expand and make more effective its role in the development of
the region. A number of studies were completed to help the
Bank to evolve appropriate operational policies and direc~
tions for its future lending. The most notable among these was
the updating of the Asian Agricultural Survey. Important innovations were initiated in the design, formulation, selection and
appraisal of projects to better reflect social considerations
without compromising economic viability. Various steps were
considered to further help DMCs to select and adopt approptiate technology in different fields.

The major initiatives taken by.the Bank in support of its
future lending operations— the replenishment of the ADF and
the second generat capital increase — have been described in
the previous chapter.

19aneOPERATIONS AND POLICIES

Lending Operations

IN 1976, the Bank’s loan approvals totalled $775.9 million, an
increase of 17.5 per cent’ over 1975. Loans from ordinary
capital resources amounted to $540.04 miltion, and those
from Special Funds $235.86 million. Thirty-seven loans were
approved for 36 projects in 16 developing member countries
(OMCs). Cumulative loan approvals reached $3,359.47 miilion.

Six DMCs received loans exciusively from ordinary capital resources, namely indonesia ($109.34 million), Republic
ot Korea ($114 million}, Malaysia {$42 million), Philippines
($116.2 million), Singapore ($23.6 million} and Thailand
($72.1 million).

Nine DMCs received loans exclusively from Special Funds:
Afghanistan ($24.8 million), Bangladesh ($53.5 million),
Burma ($45.9 million), Gilbert Isiands ($1.75 million), Nepal
($44.3 million), Papua New Guinea ($21.24 million), Solomon
islands ($3.57 million), Sri Lanka ($5 million) and Western
Samoa ($3 million).

Pakistan received loans from both sources ($62.8 million
from ordinary capital resources and $32.8 million, from
Special Funds).

Gilbert islands and Solomon Islands received their first
loans from the Bank.

Lending from ordinary capital resources grew in 1976 by
9.3 per cent over 1975 and lending from Special Funds by
41.9 per cent. The relatively higher growth in Speciai
Funds lending compensated for the slight decline, due to
resource constraints, in concessional lending in 1975, and
reestablished the trend towards steady growth. This
improvement in concessional lending was made possible
largely by the availability of contribution to the Asian
Development Fund from the developed member countries
during 1976 (see Chapter on Special Funds on page 49).

The ioans approved in 1976 included two suplementary

for financing cost overruns, an engineering loan of $2.5
million for the preparation of a feasibility study and
detaiied design of a large-scale fertilizer project in Bangladesh, and two technical assistance loans totalling $1.43

4 Using the World Bank's disbursement and commitment price deflators, the
increase in real terms is 9.8 per cent and 10.6 per cent, respectively.

million for the Fourth Mindanao Power Project in the
Philippines and the smallest loan was $280,000 {for technical assistance) for the South East Sulawesi Transmigration
Area Development Project in Indonesia. In the case of
loans from Special Funds, the size of which has been generally smaller, the Bank approved in 1976 its largest loan
so far from such resources ($45.9 million) for the Sedawgyi Multi-Purpose Dam and trrigation Project in Burma, as
well as another large loan ($39.5 million) for the Hetauda
Cement Project in Nepal.

in accordance with the policy adopted in 1974, five loans to
five countries in 1976 included foreign exchange for financing
local currency expenditures, compared to eight such loans to

that, in the former case, the local cost component is higher.
In cases where domestic procurement was incorporated,
Bank ‘financing was limited to the foreign exchange costs
of the contract awarded.

Domestic Procurement for Bank-Financed Projects

With a view to promoting domestic industries in DMCs,
many of which suffer from underutilization of capacity and
shortages of foreign exchange for importing maintenance
parts and intermediate components, and without compromising the established principles of economy and efficiency, procurement and Bank financing arrangements were modified in

tional competitive basis without special preference to any one
country. The guidelines provide that, in special circumstances, the Bank and the borrower may agree that procedures other than ‘international competition may be more’
appropriate. When the Bank is satisfied that domestic produc
tion is reasonable in price, quality, delivery schedule, etc.,
focal supply has in certain cases been incorporated within the

The above aspects of procurement in Bank-financed projects were reviewed and the following arrangements were24

approved.

(a) The Bank will finance the same amount or percentage
of a contract regardless of whether the contract is
awarded to a domestic or a foreign supptier/contractor, provided international icompetitive bidding is
effectively carried out under the Bank's Guidelines for
Procurement.

(b) Procurement of domestic goods and construction
services under Bank financing (which will be limited
to the foreign exchange component), will be permitted in appropriate cases, where:

{i) Local production or construction facilitios are
avaitable at a reasonable cost, are efficient and
adequate in terms of prompt delivery;

{ii) it is considered unlikely that foreign contractors
and suppliers would be interested in bidding, or
that the advantages of international competitive
bidding would be outweighed by the administrative burdens involved;

(iii}The procedures to be followed for domestic procurement (e.g., domestic competition, prequalification, ete.) are satisfactory to the Bank: and

(iv) The borrower specifically requests the adoption of
this procedure

The above domestic procurement arrangement applies to
loans approved after 15 July 1976. The above arrangement in
regard to financing the same amount or percentage of a contract, which places a local supplier/contractor in a no less
favorable position than a foreign competitor, is effective for
loans approved after 1 January 1976.

Co-Financing

During 1976, the Bank organized co-financing arrangements totalling $132.6 million in respect of seven projects in
six OMCs. These included: Port Qasim Project in Pakistan —
Belgium, Buigaria, Canada, France, Federal Republic of Germany and United Kingdom ($64.5 million); Second Road Project in Indonesia — Saudi Fund for Development ($50 million);
Beef Cattle Development Project in Solomon Isiands —
Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom ($2.3 million);
Serajgonj Integrated Rural Development Project in Bangladesh — United Nations Capital Development Fund ($2.3 million} and UNICEF ($0.25 million), and South East Sulawesi
Transmigration Area Development Project in Indonesia —
UNDP ($0.225 million).

In addition. $5 million for the Water Supply Project in Singapore and $8 million for the Fourth Mindanao Power Projectin
the Philippines are being co-financed by commercial banks.
Arrangements of this kind could become increasingly important in development financing. in these arrangements, part of
the financing is specificaily arranged on terms which are suitabie for lending by commercial banks. A notable jeature is the
“eross-detault’ clause, which gives additional security to
the co-lender and can also result in more attractive terms
to the borrower, although operation of the clause is
optional to the lender. Through these arrangements the
Bank can act as a catalyst in the transfer of additional private sector resources to its DMCs, on more favorable terms
than would otherwise have been the case,

to seven. The Bank has continued to maintain flexibility in
helping these, mostly smali and less developed, island countries. Special efforis have been needed to evolve suitable
projects in these DMCs and to improve their capacity to utilize
development assistance effectively. During 1976, there was a
substantial increase in both the number and amount of loan
and technical assistance projects approved for South Pacific
BMCs. Under the technical assistance provided to Tonga and
Western Samoa by the Bank in 1975, comprehensive
development pians were prepared, which resulted in the identification of project possibilities and the expansion of aid
programs for these two countries.

in pursuit of its objective of establishing and strengthening local development finance institutions (DFls), the Bank
provided assistance to DFls in three of the seven DMCs in
the South Pacific during 1976. This comprised technical
assistance for upgrading the Agricultural and industrial
Loans Board in Solomon Islands; a second credit tine and
technical assistance for the Development Bank of Western

The sectoral distribution of 1976 loans is shown in the
diagram on page 21. Comparative percentages for the four
sectors for 1976 and 1975 (in brackets) are as follows:
agriculture and agro-industry—25.89 (37.23); industry
(including development banks)—26.36 (19.46). public
utilities—26.28 (28.76), and transport and communications—21.47 (12.35).

Agriculture and Agro-Industry

Of the 12 loans to the agriculture and agro-industry sector totalling $200.89 million which were approved in 1976,
eight loans for $153.8 million were given for irrigation and
land development projects and three loans for $44.6 million
were for seeds, beef cattle and fisheries development projects, and an engineering loan of $2.5 million was made for
a fertilizer project in Bangladesh, which is expected to lead
in the near future to a Bank loan for the purpose, possibly
with co-financing from other sources.

Lending to the agricultural sector aims not only at
increasing the production of food and other edible products but also at enhancing employment opportunities and
incomes and hence improving general living conditions of
the rural poor. it is noteworthy that $108 million of the total
for agriculture was provided in Special Funds foans, and
that this represents 46 per cent of the total lending from
Special Funds in 1976. An exampie of the broad scope of
projects in this sector is the Namgang Area Development
Project in the Republic of Korea ($32 million), under which
various development activities will be provided in 26 independent sub-project areas; these activities include irrigatlon systems, soil conservation and reforestation, farm
mechanization, marketing facilities, importation of dairy
cattle, extension services, village water supply, modernization of medical facilities, and village-level development.

The Sedawgyi Multi-Purpose Dam and irrigation Project in
Burma ($45.9 million}, is aimed principally at increasing
agricultural output. as well as expanding employment and
income generation opportunities of farm families in the
area, the loan will also finance the improvement of power
and water supply systems for urban centers in the neighborhood of the dam. The Southern Land Settlements Project in Thailand ($16.1 million) will contribute to increasing
farm incomes and promoting employment and faster
economic growth in some of southern Thailand's poorest
provinces. The Serajgonj Integrated Rural Development
Project in Bangladesh ($26 million) will improve irrigation
facilities, agricultural production, employment and social
services for people in the project area. The Seeds Project
in Afghanistan ($14 million) will establish a modern seeds
indusiry, which will provide certified high-quality wheat
and cotton seeds to farmers and benefit future production

Industry (including Development Banks)

Nine loans totalling $204.5 million were approved during
the year for the industry (including development banks)
sector: seven credit lines for $153 million were extended
to DFls to meet the foreign exchange needs of industries in
the countries concerned and two loans of $51.5 million
were made to help specific industrial projects. Among the
seven DFls receiving loans in 1976, the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines and the Medium
Industry Bank of Korea received their fourth loans from the
Bank; the Korea Development Finance Corporation. the
Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation, the
Bangladesh Shiipa Rin Sangstha and the Development
Bank of Western Samoa received second loans, and the
Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon received its
first loan. The two projects financed through direct lending
to industry by the Bank are of significant economic importance: the Coal Development Project in the Republic ofKorea, the first project in the coal-mining sector to be
financed by the Bank, will contribute to the country's
efforts to exploit indigenous energy resources so as to
minimize imports of costly crude oil; the Hetauda Cement
Project in Nepal will supply essential construction material
and contribute to economic development by reducing that
country’s dependence on imported cement.

Public Utilities

The public utilities sector accounted for eight loans for
$203.95 million in 1976, of which three loans for $128.7
million were made for power development, four loans of
$74.1 million for water supply and the remaining loan of
$1.15 million for urban development. In power developmeni, the Bank continued to place emphasis on the utilization of indigenous energy sources; among the three power
projects financed by the Bank, two were for hydropower
development and one for power distribution.

The four water supply projects financed by the Bank will
benefit the large metropolitan area of Singapore as well as
relatively smaller urban centers in Malaysia, Pakistan and
Papua New Guinea. The water supply project in Pakistan also
contains a sewerage element aimed. at improving sanitation
and public health in the project area, Apart from power and
water supply, the Bank entered into a relatively new area of
urban development by providing a technical assistance loan
for the Bandung Urban Development and Sanitation Projectin
indonesia’. This project will provide assistance in adopting an
integrated approach to the urban development of Bandung,
with particular emphasis on improving the living conditions of
the urban poor.

Transport and Communications

Eight loans for $166.56 million were made for projects in
the transport and communications sector in 1976. Of these,
five loans for $93.76 million were given for roads, including a
causeway. $48.6 million in two loans (blended) for Port Qasim
in Pakistan and one loan of $24.2 million for railways. The
Bank's lending for roads was designed to improve access
from rural areas to market outlets in urban centers, thus
upgrading the infrastructure network and contributing to the
social and economic development of the areas concerned.
The Port Qasim Project in Pakistan will help the Government cope with its growing transport demands for bulk
and semi-bulk commodities and relieve the growing congestion in Karachi Port. The purpose of the Bank's lending
for a railway project in the Philippines, the second such
project to be financed by the Bank, is to rehabilitate the
Manila-Legaspi railway line and to introduce a number of
institutional reforms.

Education

While no education loans were approved by the Bank in
1976, a technical assistance grant of $95,000 was provided
during the year for a vocational education project in Nepal.
which is expected to lead to a Bank loan in the near future. A

Philippines was also being processed during the year. This is
expected to be submitted for consideration by the Board of
Directors in 1977.

Social Benefits

in 1976, the Bank continued to place emphasis on the social
benefits of its operational activities, although not at the
expense of economic viability. Bank lending to the agricu!tural sector generally contributed to employment generation
and improvement in the incomes of the rural poor. The integrated development approach in agricultural lending adopted
by the Bank was further strengthened in 1976 with the incorporation of new elements of social significance. For instance,
the Serajgonj Integrated Rural Development Project in Bangladesh included, aside from traditional aspects of irrigation
and supporting facilities, pilot schemes for rural industries
and rural education, provision for the organization of rural
youth and women through selected economic activities,
and facilities for improvement of health and family plan

agriculture and nutrition education in the province.

Lending to DFls, which serve as intermediaries for channelling loan proceeds to smait and medium-sized industries, had
asignificant social Impact in terms of the creation of employment opportunities, both in rural and urban areas.

In the development of infrastructure, attention has also
been paid to providing power, water and transport links for
poor people so that the low-income groups of population in
the respective project areas will also benefit by these necessary amenities.

Loan Administration

By the end of 1976, the total number of loans under
implementation had risen to 208. In order to minimize delays
in project implementation, the supervision and monitoring of
ongoing projects was intensified. Fisid vislts by staff were
made to 183 projects in 1976, compared to 119 projects in
1975. in-house project supervision was improved through
closer monitoring of actual progress made, and regular
reviews of problem projects were undertaken by senior
staff, as were periodic analyses of procurement and disbursement trends. Special efforts were made to help
executing agencies expedite the procurement of goods
and disbursement of loan proceeds. Improvements in the
Bank's internal practices and procedures for loan administration were also introduced; a loan administration manual
reached the final drafting stage, and a more systematic
teview of procurement transactions was introduced.

Considering that the early appointment of consultants

_ for project implementation is crucial to the timely comple
tion of detailed designs and the preparation of tender
documents, the Consulting Services Division has concentrated on measures to help accelerate’ the employment of
consultants, such as by supplying instruction materiais and
proforma documents on congultant selection procedures,
providing long lists of consultants for executing agencies’
consideration if so requested, and participating as observers or providing advice in contract negotiations, where
necessary.

' Post-Evaluation

in fine with the Bank’s Program for post-evaluation
(approved in 1974), two external post-evaiuation studies were
completed during 1976 by groups of outside experts— one on
a water supply project and the other on an irrigation project.
Three post-evaluation: studies were conducted internally —
one on a palm oil project. another on a water supply project
and the third on a petrochemical industry project; field work
was also completed on a fisheries project.

The objective of these studies is to learn from past experience, especially with regard to achieving improvements in the
efficiency and effectiveness of future Bank-assisted projects.
The achievements of a project are assessed, together with
their significance in the overall socio-economic development
of the countries concerned. In addition, the adequacy of the
Bank’s appraisal and other procedures and the performance
of the project executing agencies are analyzed with a view to
assessing their effectiveness in meeting the intended objectives.

(n general, the post-evaluation studies have shown that

instances of delay in execution and of cost-overruns. In most
cases, the economic viability of the projects appeared better
after completion of the project than at the time of appraisal.
However, recommendations have been made on aspects of
planning, design and implementation and these are being
studied with a view to establishing guidelines for the appraisal
of similar projects in the future,

Technical Assistance

'n-1978, the Bank continued to place emphasis on its technical assistance operations with a view to helping its DMCs in
identifying, preparing and implementing development projects, in establishing and strengthening their national institutions, and in formulating appropriate development plans and
strategies. Twenty-four technical assistance projects amounting to $4.62 million' were approved by the Bank in 1976.
Project preparatory technical assistance amounted to $1.90
million and advisory and operational technical assistance to
$2.72 million. In three of the technical assistance projects,
the Bank agreed to act as Executing Agency for UNDP,
using UNOP funds amounting to $1.91 million.

Twenty technical assistance projects were completed in
1976 — 15 for project preparation and five for advisory and

per cent went to industry (including development banks},
including assistance to five OFis, and to a study of a small
industries canter in Tonga; 19 per cent to the transport and
communications sector, and about 12 per cent to public
utilities. The remaining technical assistance was for vocational education in Nepal.

Sixteen loan projects approved in 1976 resulted from earlier technical assistance provided by the Bank. The total
amount of the loans is $364.12 million. The total cost of technical assistance that preceded these projects was $3.1 million,
By the end of 1976, cumulatively, 74 loans totalling $932.83
million had resuited from technical assistance activitles
undertaken by the Bank costing $11.63 miltion.

During the year, the Bank began a comprehensive review of
its technical assistance operations and policies. It is expected
that this review will be completed early in 1977.

Regional Activities

Six regional activities, mainly in the fields of agriculture
and development banking, were financed by the Bank in
1976 at a cost of nearly $1 million. (These are listed on
page 33.)

An amount of $460,000 was approved for undertaking the
Second Asian Agricultural Survey. This foliowed the recommendation of a Consultative Committee of internationally
known experts convened in December 1975, that the Asian
Agricultural Survey undertaken by the Bank in 1967-68 should
be updated. The purpose was to provide the Bank with an
appropriate perspective and the necessary impetus for contributing more effectively to the process of agricultural and
rural development in future, in light of the changes in the
agricultural situation in Asia which have occurred since the
earlier study was made. A Task Force began Its work on this
project at the Bank's Headquarters in June 1976. It comprised
@ core group of seven experts, supplemented by about a
dozen associate experts who spent between one and two
months each in assisting the core group on specific subjects.
A number of internationa! and national agencies, including
the International Rice Research institute, the Food and
Agriculture Organization and the international Food Policy

Research Institute, assisted the project through the release of
staff or the provision of relevant material. Visits to DMCs and
discussions with government officials and other individuals
were cartied out by small teams containing both core group
members and associate experts. The draft report of the Task
Force was received by the Bank at the end of the year.

Some of the world’s poorest farmers will benefit from the
technical assistance grant of $325,000 approved by the Bank
for the International Crops Research institute for the SemiArtd Tropics {ICRISAT). The grant by the Bank will support
new research by ICRISAT—established five years ago with
internationat backing in Hyderabad, India—into the development of improved animal-drawn farm equipment and implements for use in the semi-arid tropical areas of Asia, comprising parts of Burma, India, Pakistan and Thailand. These areas
have a combined population of 300 million, most of whom
usually work smali fragmented farm holdings. The main thrust
of ICRISAT's research activities is directed towards evolving
suitable dry farming techniques and the selection, improvement and utilization of crops that can be grown with restricted
water supplies

A Regional Tralning Program on Development Banking
(the fourth undertaken by the Bank) was held in Seoul, Republic of Korea, from 13 September to 23 October, in collaboration with the Korea Development Bank, the Korea Development Finance Corporation and the Medium Industry Bank. An
amount of $114,000 was provided by the Bank for the Progran. Twenty-five professional staff from 18 DFls in 11 DMCs
attended the Program, which was geared, as were the previous programs, to project analysis and covered all aspects of
the project cycle relating to small and medium-sized }
trial projects, Particular emphasis was placed on the financial and economic aspects of project appraisal, as well as
on project implementation and supervision. The four regional programs on development banking so far organized
by the Bank have heiped train 88 staff members from 32
DFls in 17 OMCs.

ference was the third in the series convened by the Bank. The
Fourth Regional Conference of Development Banks of Asia
had been convened by the Bank in July 1969 in Manila in
response to a generai suggestion made at the Third Regionai
Conference in Tokyo in September 1966, a few months before
the Bank was established. The Fourth Conference focussed
on some of the basic problems met by development banks in
the “Identification, Formulation, Evaluation and implementation of Investment Proposals’. The Bank had also convened
the Fifth Conference in August 1973 in Manila. That Conference dealt with the ‘Operational Experiences of Development
Banks—Problems Encountered in the Promotion of industrial
Development”.

The basic objective of these Conferences is to provide a
forum where senior executives from DFis from within as welt
as outside the region can exchange views on maiters of
mutual interest.

The main theme of the Sixth Conference was “Development Through Cooperation among Development Finance
Institutions’. The Conference was attended by 84 participants
from 31 DFls in the region, six non-regional DFls and institutions and 11 international organizations, including the United
Nations, UNDP, the United Nations Industria! Development
Organization (UNIDO), and the World Bank Group. During
their deliberations, the participants focussed on the need to
pay greater attention to adopting appropriate technology
suited to the specific requirements of the projects supported
by DFls, and also explored various operationat problems facing their institutions in areas such as the interest rates applied
on international credit lines and the sources of external
financing. The degree of attention which DFls can, or should,
attach to the socio-econonmic considerations underlying
project financing, was a subject leading to an intensive
exchange of views. The continued importance of suitable
training activities was frequently stressed by delegates.

One result of the Conference was an agreement to establish
the “Association of Development Finance Institutions in Asia
and the Pacific’, Among the main objectives of this Association are the development of a professional body to forward

cooperation among DFis. A Constitution for the Association
was adopted and a nine-member interim Management Committee was elected. Itis expected that future Regional Conferences of DFis will be convened by the Association in different
countries by rotation.

The Bank sponsored a Regional Training Seminar on
Agricultural Credit in Manila and Los Bafios, Philippines, in

November/December, in collaboration with the German
Foundation for International Development (DSE) and the
Southeast Asia Regional Center for Agriculture (SEARCA).
The Seminar, which marked the beginning of the Bank's
direct involvement in agricultural credit training, was
attended by 20 senior executives from 19 agricufturai
finance corporations, rural banks, cooperatives, commercial banks and other institutions deating with the agricuitural sectors in. 14 DMCs. The Seminar examined the main
aspects of agricultural credit in the region; discussed
techniques of analyzing and meeting credit requirements
by farmers; reviewed credit programs and major institutional aiternatives for delivering small farm credit as are
found in several countries in Asia; identified the barriers to
improved performance in future; deait with policy issues
critical to the success of credit programs and to institutional viability; and considered the manifold training needs
of agricultural credit institutions and the possibilities of
dealing with them appropriately. The Bdnk contributed
$40,006 to the cost of holding the Seminar.

A grant of $31,500 was approved for the Asian Productivity Organization’s (APO) Seventh Project Feasibility Study
Training Course, which will be held in the Philippines
(Stage |) and Japan (Stage II} from January to March 1977.
The Bank had earlier provided assistance for the Third,
Fourth, Fifth and Sixth APO Project Feasibility Study Training Courses. The Sixth Course was held in the Philippines
and Japan from January to March 1976 and was attended
by 25 participants from 10 regionat member countries of
the Bank.

In its role as Administrator of the Second Nam Ngum
Development Fund and coordinator of the execution of the
Project, the Bank assisted further in the implementation of
Phase il of the Nam Ngum Hydropower Project in the Lao
People’s Democratic Republic. Sufficient additional financing to cover substantial cost overrun on the Project was
mobitized. Formalities regarding additional contributions
offered earlier by various Contributor Governments were
finalized on 12 April at the Bank’s Headquarters by the

ond Nam Ngum Development Fund Agreement 1974. This
Supplementary Agreement liberalized the terms of some
previous contributions to the Fund, provided for additional
or new contributions, and ensured that sufficient funds
would be available for financing the Project, now estimated
to cost a total of $42.7 million. The Governments which
signed the Supplementary Agreement are Australia, Cana
thre iiterests of is Members and te promotion or of regionar ‘signing of the-Suppienrentary “Agreement 1976 tothe Sees

33da, France, Federal Republic of Germany, India, Japan, Lao
People's Democratic Republic, New Zealand. Switzerland,
Thailand and United Kingdom. The Netherlands had earlier
agreed to make an additional contribution to the Fund
under a separate arrangement. With the exception of one
contract for village electrification, ali of the contracts
financed either out of the Fund or by the Federal Republic
of Germany have now been awarded, and work under various individual contracts is proceeding normally. Despite
certain delays experienced in early 1976 due to the closure
of the border between Thailand and Laos and some disturbances affecting personnel working at the dam site during
May 1976, the implementation of the Project was substantially on schedule at year-end and is expected lo be completed as anticipated by the second quarter of 1978. The
Project will provide Laos with sufficient power generating
capacity to meet the expected growth in internal demand
beyond 1977, with substantial surplus power available for
export to Thailand.

Interagency Cooperation

The annual consultations between the Presidents of the
African, Asian and Inter-American Development Banks—the
seventh in the series — were held on 2 October at the Bank's

UPPER Pasig River near Laguna de Bay, Philippines, one of
Southeast Asia's largest lakes. A project designed to improve

Headquarters and were attended also by the President of the
Islamic Development Bank and by representatives of the Presidents of the World Bank Group and the Arab Fund for
Economic and Social Development. The Islamic Development
Bank and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development participated for the first time.

The meeting discussed the outlook for mobilization of additional resources in the coming few years, the policies that the
institutions should consider in order to augment capital
inflows into developing countries, and the methods of further
intensifying cooperation between the participating institutions, with special reference to these activities relating to
intergrated rural development and the incorporation of
appropriate technologies in the development process. The
meeting also reviewed the progress made by the Development
and Finance Commissions of the Paris Conference on international Economic Cooperation (in which the African, Asian and
inter-American Development Banks have been ad hoc observers}.

Responding to requests of other aid organizations to
share its experience in the development effort, the Bank
made available several officers for short-term attachmenis
io the Saudi Fund for Development and the islamic
Development Bank.

World Bank Group

Through frequent visits by officers and exchanges of
information in regard to operational activities and country
economic developments, cooperation between the Bank and
the World Bank has been continued. The Bank was represented in an observer capacity at the aid coordination meetings tor Bangtadesh, Republic of Korea, Pakistan, Philippines,
Sri Lanka and Thailand and the inaugural meetings for coordination of aid to Burma and Nepai, which the World Bank
convened in 1976. The Bank was also represented by a team of
observers at the IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings held in
Manila in October 1976. In addition, the President attended
the Fifth and Sixth Meetings of the Joint Ministerial Committee of the Bank and the Fund (the Development Committee) held in Jamaica in January and in Manila in October,
respectively,

United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)

The Bank continued its cooperation with UNDP during the
year. There were frequent consultations and exchanges of
information between UNDP Headquarters and field offices,
and the Bank. In 1976, the Bank agreed to act as Executing
Agency for three technica! assistance projects involving

UNDP contributions totalling $1.91 million—the Railway and

Jute Seed Projects in Bangladesh, and the South East
Sulawesi Transmigration Area Development Project in
Indonesia. The’ amount of $224,868 for the tast-mentioned
project was provided under a revised financing plan for the
project originally approved in 1975, the Bank providing the
balance in the form of a technical assistance loan. UNDP
financing for the Bandung Urban Development and Sanitation
Project, originally approved in 1975, did not eventuate, and
the project was financed in 1976 by the Bank, partly by loan
and partly by grant.

During the year, the Bank entered into a deferred billing
arrangement with UNDP regarding expenditures incurred in
1976 on five ongoing UNDP projects for which the Bank had
agreed to act as Executing Agency, so that implementation of
these projects could proceed as planned. This arrangement
provides that the expenditures in question would initially—————nrgratarger tow of exterat- resources for food production; ——ts-cooperative technical assistance_arcangement will open __

be borne by the Bank and would be billed and settled by
UNDP in 1977.

Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)

Cooperation between the Bank and FAO in 1976 continued
to be close, as in past years, and was guided by the Interim
Cooperative Agreement established in 1968. FAO provided a
team of experts on a cost-sharing basis for project preparatary technical assistance to Burma for a livestock project,
while FAO staff participated in a fact-finding mission for an
agricultural development projectin Western Samoa. FAO also
released two of its experts to participate in the Second Asian
Agricuiturat Survey, and another two experts for the Seminar
on Agricultural Credit, one to assist in the planning of the
Seminar, and the other to join the faculty of the Seminar
(see Regional Activities, pages 32 and 33.) The Bank
participated in FAO-sponsored meetings on the Establishment of a Center on integrated Rurai Development for Asia
held in February/March, in the FAO inland Fisheries Con
’ ference in Kyoto, Japan, in May/June and in the Thirteenth

FAO Regional, Conference for Asia and the Far East in
Manila in August.

International Fund for Agricultural Development
(IFAD)

The Bank has maintained a close association with the
deliberations relating to IFAD and was represented at the
various meetings of interested countries leading to the
adoption of the Agreement on the Establishment of IFAD
on 13 June 1976. IFAD aims to raise initial contributions
totalling at least $1 billion in freety convertible currency, to
be applied for agricultural projects primarily for food production, in the developing countries. When established,
IFAD is likely to rely, for its operations, upon the existing
global and regional international institutions. A set of working papers was prepared by the Bank on various operational aspects of IFAD to assist the Preparatory Commission. The Bank proposed a joint meeting of interested
international development banks to discuss matters of
common interest concerning IFAD. The meeting was
hosted by the IDB in June 1976 at its headquarters in
Washington, D.C. It was agreed at the meeting that three
regional banks, i.e., AfOB, ADB and !DB would prepare a
joint working paper in the form of an Aide Memoire covering matters requiring special attention by the Preparatory
Commission. The Aide Memoire, making observations of
the banks on certain operational aspects of IFAD, was forwarded to the Preparatory Commission in November 1976.

Towards the end of the year, a staff member was seconded ©

to, assist the Commission for a six-month period. IFAD is
expected to come into operation by middle of 1977.

Consultative Group on Food Production and Investment in Developing Countries (CGFP})

CGFPI, which was established by the World Food Conference in November 1974, was given the functions of encouragimproving the coordination of activities of different muitilateral and bilateral donors providing financial and technical
assistance for food production; and ensuring a more effective
use of available resources. The First Meeting of the Group
took piace in Washington, D.C., in July 1975 and the Second
meeting was also held in Washington, in February 1976. Atthe
invitation of the Bank, the Third Meeting of CGFPI took place

 

FARMER in Nepa d rice. Two projects in
the country are aimed at extending credit facilities to individual farmers and to agricultural cooperatives for the
development of farm production, storage and marketing
infrastructure.

at the Bank’s Headquarters from 22-24 September. Delegations and observers from 13 developed countries, nine
developing countries, the World Bank, FAO, UNDP and other
international organizations participated. The Meeting agreed
on a narrow-focussed and realistic work program for CGFPI
based on assistance to three or four major food deficit countries in the preparation of national food plans and continuation and expansion of the ongoing analyses of resource flows
in agriculture.

European Economic Community (EEC)

During the year, the Bank established a framework for
cooperation with the EEC. Under this arrangement, the EEC
will provide a grant of $1.875 million to finance a Bankexecuted program of technical assistance in 1977 to several of
its DMCs. Projects qualifying for EEC assistance will be those
that would contribute to rural development. It is hoped that

the way for possible co-financing by the EEC of loan projects
in the near future.

Other International Organizations

Cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO)
was further strengthened with the institution of regular informal meetings of exchange information on the operational

programs of the two organizations to promote better coordination in future and to identify activities of common interest.
Such consultations have resulted in the participation of WHO
experts in Bank missions during the year. The possibility of
the Bank co-sponsoring a regional seminar in the field of
environmenial heaith with WHO in 1977 has also been raised

There was also continuing cooperation between the
Bank and other international organizations such as the
International Labor Organization (ILO), the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the
United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF); information has been exchanged with these organizations and
consultations have been held on matters of mutual interest.
\n staff discussions with ILO, various possibilities of cooperation were indicated, including joint sponsorship of a
regional seminar on the application of appropriate technology in road construction and maintenance. Ouring the
year, UNESCO made available a consultant to participate in
a fact-finding mission for an education project in
Indonesia, while UNICEF and UNCDF participated in the

co-financing of the Serajgonj Intergrated Rural Develop
ment Project in Bangladesh (see page 24).

The Bank deputed an officer to work in the Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) as a
member of the Inter-Agency Task Force on integrated Rural
Development, and had preliminary discussions with ESCAP
on the possibility of Bank financing for Part il of an industrial
survey in the South Pacific region.

in its accounts and the maintenance of value of such currencies held by the Bank. Settlements of amounts receivable from
or payable to member countries in respect of such maintenance of value obligations were made in regard to most of
these currencies during the year.

Loan Disbursements and Repayments

Loan disbursements from ordinary capital resources in
1976 amounted to $263.38 million, bringing total disbursements to 31 December 1976 to $947.51 miltion. Loan
repayments totalled $35.29 million, $31.58 million on loans
held by the Bank and $3.71 million on portions sold to
participants. Cumulative loan repayments reached $84.04
million, $74.97 miition on loans heid by the Bank and $9.07
million on portions sold to participants.

i As a result of this review, the tending rate was reduced to 8.70 per cent
with effect from 1 January 1977, while for higher-income DMCs il was
decided that, instead of imposing a higher interest rate, the maturity
period of loans made after 1 January 1977 would be subject to a limit of 15
years, inclusive of a grace period of three years. The amount of lending lo
such countries in future is to be kept at modest levels and would preferadiy be for projects with 2 significant socral content.

Investments

At the end of the year, the Bank's total investments—held in
22 currencies—amounted to the equivalent of $1,006.5 million, 29.1 per cent of which was heid in government securities
and government-guaranteed obligations of member countries and 70.9 per cent in time deposits and certificates of
deposit with banks in member countries and the Bank for
international Settlements.

Of the total investments in government securities and
government-guaranteed obligations of member countries,
31,7 per cent was invested in securities maturing within one
year and 68.3 per ceni In securities maturing after one year. Of
the total Investments In time deposits and certificates of
deposit with banks in member counirles and the Bank for
International Settlements, 50.2 per cent was invested in
deposits maturing within one year and 49.8 per cent In
deposits maturing after one year,

Income and Expenses

Gross income for the year was $128.30 million. Administrative Expenses for the year were $18.79 miliion 2 of which $6.01
miltion was charged to Special Funds resources as an
Administration Charge to Special Operations. Net Administrative Expenses attributable to ordinary operations for
4976, therefore, were $2.78 million,

The cost of Services to Member Countries during the
year, excluding $2.47 million charged to the Technical
Assistance Special Fund, was $0.64 million.

Finahcial expenses were $72.61 miilion.

Gross Expenses for the year thus amounted to $86.03
million.

Changes in the Value of Currencies held by the Bank
during the year resulted in a net gain of $5.98 million

Net Income for 1976 was, therefore, $48.25 miltion, of which
$7.69 milion was appropriated as commission to Special
Reserve, leaving “Net Income After Appropriation of Commissions to Special Reserve” of $40.56 million, as shown in
Appendix 1-1.

Accumulated Net income and Reserves

At the end of 1975, the Bank's Ordinary Reserve was $77.05
million. At the Ninth Annual Meeting, the Board of Governors
allocated, pursuant to Article 40 of the Articles of Agreement,
the net income for 1975 in the amount of $24.54 million fo the
Ordinary Reserve, thereby increasing the Ordinary Reserve to
$101.59 milfion.

Prior to 1976, ‘Commissions Appropriated to Special
Reserve" was deducted from "Gross income”. In 1976, however, "Appropriation of Commissions to Special Reserve” was
deducted from “Net income” to arrive at “Net Income after
Appropriation of Commissions to Special Reserve”.3

After appropriaton of commissions to Special Reserve, the
net income for 1976 in the amount of $40.56 million (see
Section on income and Expenses and Appendix 1-11), is avail-.
able for allocation by the Board of Governors.

At the end of 1975, the Bank also had a Special Reserve of
$10.97 million, representing commissions appropriated to the
Special Reserve pursuant to Articles 16 and 17. In 1976, an

additional amount of $7.69 million was added to the Speci

Reserve, increasing it to $18.66 million.

Replenishment of the Asian Development Fund

THE BANK'S RESOURCES for financing loans on concessional terms were augmented during the year when the
first instalment of the replenishment of the Asian Development Fund {ADF) came into effect. The replenishment,
approved by the Board of Governors in Resolution No. 92',
is intended to finance the Bank’s concessional lending
program for the years 1976 to 1978. This Resolution
authorized the Bank to receive contributions from
developed member countries totalling $830 million, such
contributions to be made available to the Bank in three
equal annual instalments in 1976, 1977 and 1978. However,
during 1976 the Board of Governors, at the request of the
three countries concerned, approved an increase in the
contribution amount allocated under Resolution No. 92 to
Canada? and decreases in the amounts allocated to New
Zealand and the United States®, thereby reducing the overail replenishment target to $809 million.

Resolution No. 92 specified that the first instalment of
the replenishment was to become effective when the Bank
had received commitments of contributions totalling not
less than a “‘trigger’’ amount of $475 million; a target date
of 30 June 1976 was also specified. To ensure that the first
instalment became effective by this date,.a meeting of
potential donors was held in Jakarta in April 1976 in conjunction with the Ninth Annual Meeting. Contribution
commitments exceeding the “trigger amount were
received by 28 June 1976, on which date therefore the
replenishment became effective in respect of the first instalment. By the end of the year, ten countries—Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Federal Republic of
Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Norway and United Kingdom—had committed a total of $526 million to the
replenishment and released their first instalments. In addition, pending deposit of its Instrument of Contribution to

Inflow of Resources

At the end of 1975, at prevailing exchange rates, the
combined resources of the ADF and the Multi-Purpose
Special Fund (MPSF) totalled $692 miilion, of which $651
million was held in the ADF and $41 million in the MPSF.
Against these resources, commitments of $651 million had
been made, leaving a balance of only $41 million available
for further lending on concessional terms.

The first instalments of the ADF replenishment contributions received in 1976, together with Italy's first instalment
payment, totalled $177 million, at the exchange rates used
by the Bank as of 31 December 1976. This amount was
unconditionallyS available to finance additional Speciat
Funds lending by the Bank.

Further progress was made during the year towards
compieting arrangements for the initial resource mobilization for the ADF, approved by the Board of Governors in
November 1973. Up to the end of 1975, 12 developed
member countries had completed their program of contributions under these arrangements, while the United
States had contributed $100 million out of its total allocation of $4150 miflion. During 1976, it became apparent that
the United States would be in a position to deposit only
half of its outstanding balance of $50 million before the
end of the year, and in October 1976 the Board of Governors amending Resolution No. 68 to permit the Bank to
accept this balance in two equal instalments of $25 millions. The first instalment was received in November, and at
year-end the completion of necessary legislation in the
United States was awaited in respect of the remaining $25
million. Also, on 31 December 1976, Italy paid to the Bank
the total amount authorized under Resolutions Nos. 67 and
68 as its contribution to the ADF under the initial mobilization arrangements’.

Contributions to the MPSF and ADF have been made in

subject to maintenance of value obligations. in the course
of 1976, significant depreciations occurred in some of

5  UnderResolution No. 92, the availability ofthe second and third instalments is

conditional upon the Bank receiving sufficient contributions, and payments

under these contributions, to make these instalments effective.

Resolution No. 108 adopted on 31 October 1976.

these currencies against the US dollar, which is the currency of denomination of the Bank’s loan commitments,
but the corresponding decline in the values of contributions were more than offset by gains from appreciations of
several other major currencies. However, since the Bank
did not receive during the year all of the contributions contemplated under the initial mobilization and replenishment
arrangements, fewer resources were available in 1976 than
had been anticipated. As of 31 December 1976, the total
resources under administration in the ADF and the MPSF
stood at $932 million, an increase during the year of $240
million.

Transfer of Resources of the Multi-Purpose Special!
Fund

Consistent with the objective of consolidating all of the
resources availabie to the Bank for lending on concessional terms into a single Specia! Fund, ali set-aside
resources and most of the contributed resources previously administered in the MPSF had been transferred to

the ADF in the course of 1975. Consequently, at the beginning of 1976, the only contributed resources left in the
MPSF were the initial contributions of Australia and
Canada and a smajl undisbursed balance of New Zealand's
contribution. (Arrangements had been made earlier for New
Zeaiand’s contribution to be transferred to the ADF as
amounts were disbursed). Arrangements for the transfer to
the ADF of Canada's contribution were completed in March
1976, with a portion of the contribution being untied and
transferred immediately, and the balance being transferred
as committed. By year-end, the Australian and New Zeajand contributions had been fully disbursed. The whole of
the New Zealand contribution had therefore been transferred to the ADF, while the Australian contribution was awaiting transfer to the ADF pending the conclusion of appropriate arrangements with the Government, the necessary
enabling legislation having been passed by the Australian
Parliament during 1976. Thus, the only amounts remaining
in the MPSF were Australia’s initial contribution of $9.5
million awaiting formal transfer to the ADF, the uncommit-Country/Project Amount tered by the poorest and least developed of its DMCs, and

Income and Expenses

At the end of 1975, the TASF had accumulated net expense
of $9.89 million, For the year 1976, the net expense was $2.89

million, bringing accumulated net expense at the end of 1976
to $12.78 million.

At the end of 1975, the MPSF had an accumulated net
income of $3.32 million. In furtherance of the general objective of consolidating in the ADF to the greatest extent possible
the resources still being administered in the MPSF, this
amount was transferred in 1976 to the ADF, as reported to the
Board of Governors at the Ninth Annual Meeting. For the year
1976, the MPSF had a gross income of $0.47 million, expenses
of $0.18 miilion, and a net income of $0.29 million, which was
credited to "Accrued Resources" of the MPSF in accordance
with the Special Funds Rules and Regulations.

For the year 1976, the ADF had a gross income of $14.36 million, gross expenses of $5.83 million and a net gain arising
from changes in value of currencies of $0.40 million. Net
income for 1976 was therefore $8.93 million. Since the ADF
had an accumulated net income of $2.35 million at the beginning of the year, this brought its accumulated net income at

CAPITAL STOCK

The authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 307,257
shares of $10,000 par value each in terms of the United States
Dollar of the weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966.
This is equivalent to $3,706 694 820 in terms of current United
States Doliars.

The authorized capital stock consists of “callable” capital stock
and “paid-in” capital stock. The ‘‘callable’’ capital stock is
subject to cali only as and when required by the Bank to meet
obligations incurred on borrowings or on guarantees, The
“paid-in” capital stock is paid or payable partly in gold or
convertible currencies and partly in the currency of the member.
In lieu of the portion paid or payable in the currency of the
member, provided such currency is not required by the Bank
for the conduct of its operations, the Bank shall accept nonnegotiable, non-interest-bearing demand obligations in accordance with Article 6, paragraph 3.

As of 31 December 1976. the subscribed capital stock wes
$3,688,390,998 {$3,201,544,328-1975}. All matured instalments amounting to $1,069,881,657 ($959,624,081-—1975)
were received except $253,334 due from Cambodia on 6 April

1975. Instalments not due aggregating $112,594,677
{$96,016,613—1975) are receivable as follows:
1976 1975
1976 $ = $42,368,165
1977 48 453,047 28,807 638
1978 44 496,220 24,850,810
1979 19,645,410 om

On 29 October 1976, the Board of Governors approved a
proposal for a second general increase of 135 per cent in the
authorized capital stock (from 307,257 shares, valued at
$3,706,594 820 to 722,057 shares valued at $8,710,534,620).
This increase will consist of 10 per cent ‘‘paid-in’’ shares and
90 per cent ‘‘callable’’ shares. The ‘paid-in’ shares are required
to be paid for in four equal annual instalments commencing
in 1978, 40 per cent of each instalment being in convertible
currency and 60 per cent in the national currency of the

date on or befare 30 September 1977 (or such Jater date before
31 December 1977 as the Board of Directors may decide)
when subscriptions from members for at least 240,000 shares
are received by the Bank.

{n April 1976, the Board of -Governors of the International
Monetary Fund {iMF} approved proposed amendments to the
Articles of Agreement of the IMF under which, when they
become effective, gold will be abolished as a common denominator of the monetary system, currencies will no longer have

par values, and all computations relating to currencies of
members for the purpose of applying the provisions of the
Articies of the IMF will be made on the basis of the Special
Drawing Right (SDR). As a result, upon the effectivity of the
amendments to the IMF Articles, it will no longer be possible
to determine, in current monetary terms, the value of the unit
in which the Bank’s share capital is denominated, namely, the
United States Dollar of the weight and fineness in effect on
31 January 1966. The Bank has under consideration the effect
of the IMF amendments on the unit of denomination of fis
capital and the rights and obtigations of members with respect
thereto. If the SDR were substituted for the 1966 United States
Dollar in the Bank‘s Articles of Agreement, the Bank’s capital
stock would then consist of shares having @ par value of SOR
40,000 each, the value of which in current monetary terms
would vary from day to day corresponding to variations in the
current monetary value of the SDR. Therefore, the Bank's
capital stock, expressed in United States Dollars, could differ
from the amounts shown in these financial statements. !f such
a substitution were made as of 31 December 1976, the amounts
for “callable shares subscribed, “paid-in” shares subscribed
and total .shares subscribed would be $2,413,434,600,
$1,138,837 400 and $3,552,272,000, respectively. It is not
expected, however, that this substitution would have a material
effect on the financial position or results of operations of the
Bank.

assistance rendered as a part of the commitment shown leads
to loans for specific projects, the portion representing the cost
of design and engineering and any balance of amount over
$106,000 will be converted to the subsequent loan. During the

NOTE K~—
CHANGES {IN VALUE OF CURRENCIES

In 1976, there was an increase in the value of most major
currencies relative to the current United States Dollar, which
is the Bank's unit of account. This accounted largely for the
net gain of $5,980,818 on translation of currency holdings
in excess of the respective maintenance of value ceilings. In
1975, there was a decrease in the relative value of most major
currencies, which similarly accounted. for a net loss of
$7 A24_045 in that year.

NOTE 1 —
GENERAL

{a) Since 1967, the Bank has established Special Funds
Resources to finance the specia! operations of the Bank
as provided in Article 19 of the Articles of Agreement.
Such Special Funds Resources consist of a Technical
Assistance Special Fund and a Mutti-Purpose Special
Fund.

(b} in 1974, the Asian Development Fund was established.
Six contributors elected to have their contributions
to the Multi-Purpose Special. Fund made after 31
December 1972 credited toward the amount of their
contributions to the Asian Development Fund. Accordingly, their contributions were transferred to the
Asian Development Fund.

(ce) As a further step to streamline and restructure the Speciai
Funds, transfer to the Asian Development Fund of the
resources in the Multi-Purpose Special Fund {with the
concurrence of the relevant contributor) was authorized
in 1975. Accordingly, since 1 October 1975. the SetAside Resources, the contributions of eight contributors,
a portion of the contribution of Canada and the accumulated net income of the Accrued Resources as of
3% December 1975, have been transferred from the
Muiti-Purpose Special Fund to the Asian Development
Fund.

(a) Since the Special Funds Rules and Regulations do not
apply to the Asian Development Fund, the accompanying
financial statements do not include the operations and
activities of that Fund.

{b} Translation of Currencies

(i) In the cases of 3 {2-1975) contributors ‘(Bangjadesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka}, at par values
established or provisional rates agreed by these
contributers with the International Monetary
Fund:

{ii} ‘In the case of India, at central rate;

(iit} In the cases of 12 contributors (Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Federal
Republic of Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands,
New Zealand and United Kingdom), at market
rates.

Income and expense amounts in currencies other than
United States Dollars were transiated for each quarter
generally at the rates of exchange which prevailed at the
beginning of the quarter; such practice approximates
the application of average rates in effect during the
quarter.

Translation adjustments relating to funds representing
the unexpended balances of contributions were offset
by increases or decreases in the contribution accounts.
Other translation adjustments were charged or credited
to income.

No representation’ is made that any of these currencies
is convertible into any other currency at the rate or
rates specified above.

{co} Contributions

Amounts contributed by member countries are included
in the financial statements as contributions committed
from the date contribution agreements‘ are signed and
related formalities are completed. As to those member
countries which have agreed toconsider specific requests
for financing, the amounts shown in the financial
statements as contributions committed are based on the
specific requests approved through 31 December 1976
and 31 December 1975.

(d) Restatement of Certain Amounts .
Certain 1975 amounts have been restated to conform
to 1976 classifications.

NOTE 3TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SPECIAL FUND

Since 1967, contributions have been made by 21 member
countries to be used by the Bank for financing technical
assistance activities. In most cases, the initial use of the contributions shall be for the procurement of expert services and
facilities from the contributing member country. There has been,
however, a trend towards liberalization of the procurement
terms. Therefore, some of the contributions are substantially

MULTI-PURPOSE SPECIAL FUND

{a} Since 1968,contributions have been made by 14 member
countries to be used by the Bank far financing special
operations. These contributions generally cannot be used
for providing non-reimbursable technical assistance. The

APPENDIX 1-4

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ~— SPECIAL FUNDS RESOURCES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 1976 and 31 December 1975

 

contributions made in the early years were generally
to be used initially for procurement of goods and services
from the contributing member country. In recent years
the terms of the contributions have become mare and
more lideralized. In most cases, the contributions may be
used for procurement of goods and services (a) from the
contributing member country, {b} from the territories
of developing member countries, and (c) from developed
countries which have made contributions to any Special
Fund other than the Technical Assistance Special Fund.
tn all cases the repayments may be used for procurement
of goods and services in the territories of members of the
Bank. As a result of transfers of contributions to the
Asian Development Fund [See Notes 2b} and 1{c)],
only the contribution of Australia and a portion of the
contribution of Canada remained in the Multi-Purpose
Special Fund at 31 December 1976.

{b)} Pursuant to Article 19, paragraph i{i}, the Board of
Governors has also authorized the setting aside of 10 per
cent.of the unimpaired “paid-in” capital paid by members
pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2la} and the convertible
currency portion paid by members pursuant to Article 6,
Paragraph 2{b) as of 28 April 1973 to be transferred to
the Specia! Funds. The resources so set aside, amounting
to $57,433,902 {$47,609,651 in terms of the United

States Dollar of the weight and fineness in effect on 
31 January 1866) were allocated and transferred to
the Multi-Purpose Speciai Fund to form the Set-Aside
Resources of that fund. On 1 October 1975, these
resources were transferred to the Asian Development
Fund.

(c} The term ‘Accrued Resources’ refers to the resources
derived frorn the service fee charged by the Bank in its
special operations in accordance with the Special Funds
Rules and Regulations for the Bank’s administration
of the Special Funds Resources and to certain other
income derived from Special Funds Resources credited,
held and administered by the Bank in the Muiti-Purpose
Special Fund.

NOTE 5—
LOANS

Loans approved by the Bank on concessional terms are classified
as Special Funds loans. Where necessary and when available
the resources of both the Multi-Purpose Special Fund and the
Asian Development Fund may be used either singly or jointly
to finance such loans.

Prior to 1 October 1975, the Summary Statement of Loans
of the Specia! Funds Resources included all Special Funds
loans approved before the establishment of the Asian Development Fund. From 1 October 1975, the Summary Statement
of Loans of that Fund inciuded all approved Special Funds

eee

loans. Accordingly, the amounts shown as "Effective loans
held by Bank’’ at 31 December 1976 represented only the
Portions of loans outstanding which were disbursed from the
resources remaining in the Multi-Purpose Special Fund

NOTE 6-—

ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

An Administration Charge to Special Operations was instituted
in 1971. Upon transfer of the Set-Aside Resources and certain
contributions to the Asian Development Fund [See Notes 1{b)
and 1{c}], the Administration Charge Payable to Ordinary
Capital Resources applicable to such resources and contributions
was also transferred, resulting in a net credit arising from such
transfer of the liability.

NOTE 7 —

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

The outstanding commitments, as of 31 December 1976, for
technical assistance (services to member countries) projects
and programs approved by the Bank, were approximately
$7,182,G00 ($7,738,000 — 1975}; to the extent available,
contributions to the Technical Assistance Special Fund may be
used to meet expenditures arising out of the commitments.
The amount shown is exclusive of technical assistance services
made available on a reimbursable basis; however, when technica!
assistance rendered as a part of the commitment shown leads
to loans for specific projects, the portion representing the cost
of design and engineering and any balance of amount over
$100,000 will be converted to the subsequent loan. Under such
options, technical assistance expenditures of $304,582
($288,615 — 1975) were charged to loans and credited to
income of Special! Funds Resources during the year ended
31 December 1976.

NOTE 8—

CHANGES IN VALUE OF CURRENCIES

in 1976, there was an increase in the value of most major
currencies relative to the current United States Dollar, which
is the Bank's unit of account, This accounted for the net gain
of $17,778 on translation of currencies derived from earnings.
In 1975, there was a decrease in the relative value of most major
currencies, which similarly accounted for a net loss of $625,784
in that year.HASKINS & SELLS

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 3 —
CAPITAL SET-ASIDE FOR SPECIAL OPERATIONS

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1(i}, the
Board of Governors has authorized the setting aside of 10 per
cent of the unimpaired “paid-in” capital paid by members
pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(a) and of the convertible
currency portion paid by members pursuant to Article 6.
Paragraph 2b) as of 28 April 1973, to be used as part of the
Special Funds of the Bank. The resources so set aside, amounting
to $57,433,902 {$47,609,651 in terms of the United States
Dollar of the weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966},
were allocated and transferred to the Multi-Purpose Special
Fund. On 1 October 1975, these resources were transferred
ta the Fund.

In April 1976, the Board of Governors of the International
Monetary Fund (!MF} approved proposed amendments to the
Articles of Agreement of the IMF under which, when they
become effective, gold will be abolished as a common denominator of the monetary system, currencies will no longer have
par values, and alf computations relating to currencies of members for the purpose of applying the provisions of the Articles
of the [IMF will be made on the basis of the Special Drawing Right
{SDR}. As a result, upon the effectivity of the amendments to
the IMF Articles, it will no longer be possible to determine, in
current monetary terms, the value of the unit in which the
Bank's share capital is denominated, namely, the United States
Dollar of the weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966.
The Bank has under consideration the effect of the IMF amendments on the unit of denomination of its capital and the rights
and obligations of members with respect thereto. If the SDR
were substituted for the 1966 United States Dollar in the Bank’s
Articles of Agreement, the Bank’s capital stock would then
consist of shares having a par value of SOR 10,000 each, the
value of which in current monetary terms would vary from
day to day corresponding to variations in the current monetary
value of the SDR. Therefore, Capital Set-Aside for Special
Operations, expressed in United States Doilars, could differ
from the amount shown in these financial statements. If such a
sudstitution were made as of 31 December 1976, Capital SetAside for Special Operations wouid be $55,314,300. It is not
expected, however, that this substitutian would have a material
effect on the financial position or results of operations of the
Fund.

NOTE 4—
SUPPLEMENTARY RESOURCES

The term “Supplementary Resources’ refers to the resources
accepted by the Bank from any member or non-member govern
ment of any national or international entity, public or private,
as provided in Section 2.06 of the Regulations of the Fund and
to any contribution transferred fram the Multi-Purpose Sgecial
Fund where the concerned contributor has not yet made its
initial contribution to the Fund, as provided in Section 7.03{b}
of the Regulations.

NOTE 5 —
LOANS

Loans approved by the Bank on concessional terms are clas
sified as Speciai Funds loans. Where necessary and when available the resources of both the Multi-Purpose Special Fund
and the Fund may be used either singly or jointly to finance
such loans.

Prior to 1 October 1975, the Summary Statement of Loans of
the Fund included only Special Funds loans approved aftes
the establishment of the Fund. From 1 October 1975, the
Summary Statement of Loans included all approved Special
Funds loans. Accordingly, at 3t December 1976, the portion
of loans allocated to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund, representing disbursements in respect of individual loans made from
resources remaining in that fund, were shown as an adjustment to the Summary Statement of Loans.

NOTE 6—
ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

An Administration Charge to Special Operations was instituted
in 1871. Upon transfer of the Set-Aside Resources and certain
contributions from the Multi-Purpose Special Fund [See Notes
i(o} and ife}] the Administration Charge Payable to Ordinary
Capital Resources applicable to such resources and contributions was also transferred, resulting in a net debit arising from
such transfer of the liabijity. This debit has been offset by
appropriations of accumulated net income of the Fund.

In 1976, there was an increase in the value of most major currencies relative to the current United States Dollar, which is
the Bank’s unit of account. This accounted for the net gain
of $404,423 on translation of currencies derived from earnings.
In 1975, there was a decrease in the relative value of most maior
currencies, which similarly accounted for a net loss of $151,391
in that year.HASKINS & SELLS

Statement of Income and Expenses and Accumulated Net Income

for the years ended 31 December 1976 and 31 December 1975 4-2

considered necessary in the circumstances.

Fund at 31 December 1976 and 31 December 1975 and the results of its operations.and the changes in its
financial position for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
applied on a consistent basis.

ANNUAL REPORT (3

Asian Development Bank

reAbout the Asian Development Bank

ADB's vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing
member countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people.
Despite the region’s many successes, it remains home to two thirds of the world’s poor:
1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than
$1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth,
environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.

Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main
instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity
investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.

President and Chairman
of the Board of Directors

 

he Asia and Pacific region is no stranger to trou
bled times. In 2008, on the heels of food, commod
ity and oil price shocks in the first half of the year,
the global financial crisis broadened and deepened, feeding uncertainty across financial markets, including those
in Asia. While most economies of the region are far more
stable now than when the 1997-1998 financial crisis hit,
plunging equity prices and shrinking credit markets imply
tough times ahead. Most importantly for developing Asia
is the spillover into the real economy, with sharply declining exports and production growth threatening to reverse
the region’s hard-won progress. The Asian Development
Bank (ADB) responded quickly, allocating over $4 billion
of additional resources to support the efforts of its developing member countries to deal with these crises.

This rapidly shifting environment underscored the
need for ADB to remain flexible and responsive. At the
same time, another key development—the launch of
ADB’s long-term strategic framework 2008-2020 (Strategy 2020) clarified our priorities. Strategy 2020 sets a
strategic direction for ADB, with a clearer focus on poverty reduction through inclusive growth, environmentally
sustainable growth, and regional integration. Strategy
2020 further focuses our operations in the five core areas
of infrastructure, environment, regional cooperation and
integration, finance sector development, and education.
It also highlights the need for greater private—public sector investments in the region. Responding to this need, we
will increase our support for private sector development
to 50% of our annual operations by 2020.

To carry out our work under Strategy 2020, ADB will
need significantly more resources than in the past. I am

pleased that we were able to successfully conclude ne
gotiations for the ninth replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (ADF X) and the fourth regularized

replenishment of the Technical Assistance Special Fund.

 

The total replenishment amount of $11.3 billion will
enable ADB to make a greater contribution to poverty
reduction in its lower-income developing member countries, particularly during this difficult period.

To deliver our mission of poverty reduction in all our
developing member countries, however, we also need a
substantial increase in our ordinary capital resources. This
is demonstrated by the steady growth we have seen in our
lending portfolio, which reached an unprecedented $10.5
billion last year, and by the region’s ever-increasing development finance demand. Negotiations with our shareholders on a general capital increase began in late 2008,
and we hope to reach an agreement by May 2009.

In addition to financial resources, we need to continually improve our institutional effectiveness. In 2008, ADB
became the first multilateral development bank to adopt
a corporate-wide results framework, focusing on Asia-Pacific outcomes, ADB’s contribution to country outcomes,
ADB’s operational effectiveness, and our organizational
effectiveness. The results framework, which will be refined with experience, will focus all of us more clearly on
the outcomes we wish to achieve, and hold us individually

and collectively accountable for results.

ADB has made considerable
efforts to become a more
relevant, responsive, and resultsoriented development partneron

President Kuroda meets beneficiaries of a village road project in Nagapattinam, Tamil Nadu, southern India

Based on the results framework, ADB submitted its
first Development Effectiveness Review to the Board in
October 2008. The report showed that a higher proportion
of ADB projects are delivering intended results than before
and that the performance of ADB’s ongoing loan projects
is good and improving. Impressively, projects at risk have
declined steadily from 26% in 2001 to 7% in 2008.

Progress is being made in other areas as well. Following the ADB-wide staff engagement survey, for instance,
we commissioned an independent review of our human
resources strategy, the recommendations of which have
been submitted to Management for consideration. A comprehensive evaluation of our Operations Evaluation Department also led to recommendations to enhance the
effectiveness and independence of the department. The
ongoing review of our safeguard policies garnered much
constructive input that will help strengthen these policies.
We also continued to refine and improve our financing instruments and modalities and our business processes to better
respond to the needs of our clients. While much remains to
be done in all areas, clearly ADB has made considerable
efforts to become a more relevant, responsive, and resultsoriented development partner.

These results are encouraging, particularly given the
very challenging agenda set out in Strategy 2020. Increasingly, our focus will be on climate change—an issue that
has significant and complex implications for Asia’s eco
 

nomic and social development. We are working closely
with our developing member countries to help them find
low-carbon paths to economic growth, and to adapt to the
already unavoidable impacts of climate change.

‘These and other large challenges lie ahead if we are to
achieve our goal of eliminating poverty in the region. Asia
and the Pacific must continue to grow to create a region
free of poverty, but grow sustainably, contributing to the
world’s future health and well-being. Our immediate and
most pressing challenge is to support our developing member countries through what will surely be another difficult
year for the regional and global economies. But our efforts
today must always be accompanied with a clear vision of the
more distant horizon. By focusing our investments wisely, we
can help ease the impact of the global downturn on the poor
while moving the region to a more inclusive, balanced, and
environmentally sustainable growth path. We look forward
to working with our shareholders and partners to support
the Asia and Pacific region’s continued development and
growing contributions to poverty reduction.

Haruhiko Kuroda

President and Chairman
Board of Directorshe Board of Directors is responsible for the direc
tion of the general operations of ADB, including

the approval of policies and project loans. As the
representative of ADB’s shareholders, the Board plays a
vital role in overseeing ADB’s implementation of the guidance given by its shareholders.

In 2008, the Board approved Strategy 2020, which reaffirmed ADB’s overarching mission of poverty reduction,
while comprehensively responding to the fundamental
changes in the region. Among the steps outlined in the
Strategy 2020 to achieve greater development effectiveness are a sharper focus on lending priorities and the adoption of a comprehensive results framework to be applied
across ADB.

In light of the requirements of Strategy 2020 and the
need to maintain ADB’s leading development role ina rapidly changing region, the Board began a review of ADB’s
ordinary capital resources in preparation for seeking a general capital increase. The directors also endorsed a dynamic new capital adequacy framework that brings ADB into
line with the best practices of other multilateral institutions. In addition, the Board approved a reinterpretation
of ADB’s lending limitations to increase the funds available for lending.

‘The Board’s meetings covered a broad range of policy,
financial, and administrative issues, as well as a wide variety of projects and programs. The Board also endorsed
new partnership strategies with several developing member countries. The total loan portfolio approved by the
Board in 2008 exceeded $10 billion (excluding official cofinancing).

‘The Board approved comprehensive reforms to the
technical assistance program to increase the impact of
operations. Further, it approved mainstreaming the innovative multitranche financing facility in response to rising
demand from member countries. Revisions to the 1998
graduation policy, including a shift from debt repayment
capacity to creditworthiness as one of the criteria for country classification, were also approved.

By pushing ahead with reforms in several key areas,
the Board supported improving ADB’s institutional effectiveness. It provided input for the comprehensive review of
ADB’s human resources strategy through a number of seminars and briefings. It was also directly involved in the review
of the independence and effectiveness of the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) through an ad hoc working
group chaired by an executive director. Subsequently, the

Annual Report 2008 9

directors adopted several measures to strengthen OED’s
credibility as an independent evaluation unit. The name of
the department was changed to the Independent Evaluation
Department at the start of 2009. The Board also explored
ways to improve the operations of ADB’s resident missions.

To continue assisting the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the region, the Board participated in
the successful replenishment of the Asian Development
Fund (ADF), which was completed in Madrid in May. It
also endorsed refinements to the performance-based allocation system for ADF resources.

The Board deliberated on ADB’s annual financial
statements, its budget and borrowing program for 2009,
its work program and budget framework for 2009-2011,
and the salaries and benefits of staff. It also reviewed the
3-year rolling work program and budget for 2009 of the
Asian Development Bank Institute.

Inresponse to soaring food prices, the Board discussed
a paper on how ADB can act quickly in coordination with
other development partners to meet the immediate needs
of the hardest-hit countries, and subsequently approved
emergency assistance totaling more than $200 million.

Country Partnership Strategies

The country partnership strategy maps out the ways
that ADB can most effectively work with its developing
member countries, given each country’s challenges and
priorities. It also enables ADB to evaluate a country’s development performance over the strategy period.

The Board endorsed five country partnership strategies: the People’s Republic of China (2008-2010), Cook
Islands (2008-2012), Samoa (2008-2012), Sri Lanka
(2009-2011), and Tuvalu (2008-2012). It also endorsed
an interim operational strategy (2008-2009) for ADB’s

newest member, Georgia.

Board members also attended the donors’ meetings
on the ninth replenishment of the ADF (ADF X) held in
Manila in March and in Madrid in May, contributing to
the successful outcome of the ADF negotiations.

Board Group Visits

Members of the Board made three visits around the region
to get a firsthand view of ADB projects and their impacts,
and to meet with senior government officials, development partners, private sector leaders, and other stakeholders.

On 12-29 February, a team visited Cambodia, Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam. Another
team visited Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal during
18 June—4 July. On 15-22 September, a third team visited
Kiribati. The visits strengthened ADB’s relationship with its
development partners and generated valuable feedback.

BOARD COMMITTEES

Audit Committee

The committee assists the Board in its oversight of
ADB’s financial reporting and audits, including internal
controls.

Among the topics deliberated on by the committee
were the annual report of the Office of the Auditor General’s Integrity Division, the audit recommendation and
implementation report of the outside auditor, the recommendations of the internal audit division, the expiration
of the contract of the outside auditor and selection of an
outside auditor for 2009 onward, ADB’s annual financial
statements, the audit strategy memorandum, and implementationoftheinformationsystemsand technologystrat
egy [land otherinformation technology-related activities.
The committee also reviewed ADB’s risk management
capability and the monitoring of progress in integrating
stronger risk management in ADB, as well as the performance of ADB’s nonsovereign portfolio.

The committee monitored and reviewed key issues and
actions, including financial management and accounting
standards, ordinary capital resources operating income and
net income, and travel-related cost-saving measures. The
committee also discussed the need to strengthen whistleblower protection and ongoing progress on attestation.

The committee met 11 times.

Budget Review Committee

‘The committee discussed the President’s planning directions for preparing the work program and budget framework (WPBF) for 2009-2011. It noted the efforts to
improve project implementation, focus on the Strategy
2020 priority sectors, enhance support for private sector
development, implement the technical assistance reform agenda, and mobilize cofinancing. At midyear, the
committee reviewed the progress of the 2008 operations,
noting that the operations departments had reduced the
percentage of at-risk projects. The committee was also
briefed on the efforts to lower the number of technical assistance projects without compromising the demand and
requests of developing member countries.

The committee met with the vice-presidents on
ADB’s draft WPBF (2009-2011). The committee noted
the importance of sector and thematic alignment of the
WPBF with Strategy 2020, and ADB’s innovative knowledge and advisory services in the focus areas. With the
greater and more varied resource requirements under
Strategy 2020, the committee also underscored the need
for human resources and skills mix alignment.

The committee discussed the 2009 draft budget and
highlighted the need to provide adequate staffing and other budgetary resources to successfully carry out the priorities outlined in the WPBF. The committee also noted the
importance of mainstreaming managing for development
results, especially in project implementation and portfolio management. The committee confirmed that the 2009
budgets for ADB and the Asian Development Bank Institute are consistent with the work plans, and appropriate
for consideration by the Board.

The committee met 10 times.Compliance Review Committee

‘The committee is responsible for clearing the terms of reference of the Compliance Review Panel (CRP) and the
time frame for conducting each compliance review authorized by the Board, and reviewing the CRP’s draft reports
on monitoring the implementation of any remedial actions approved by the Board. The committee is mandated
to meet as often as it considers necessary.

‘The committee met twice, once to discuss the CRP’s
fourth monitoring report (2007-2008) on implementation of Board-approved remedial actions of the Chashma
Right Bank Irrigation Project in Pakistan, and once on the
CRP’s second annual monitoring report 2007-2008 on
implementation of Board-approved remedial actions
of the Southern Transport Development Project in Sri
Lanka. All such monitoring reports are posted on the
CRP website (www.compliance.adb.org). The committee also held several informal discussions with the
CRP members on implementation of the accountability
mechanism, especially on compliance review practices
and procedures.

Development Effectiveness Committee

‘The committee reviewed 17 independent evaluation reports by OED. Some of the major findings and recommendations were considered in finalizing Strategy 2020 and the
Donors’ Report for ADF X. The committee also discussed
OED’s findings and recommendations on issues related

to ADB’s institutional effectiveness, such as managing for
development results, resident mission operations, and
ADB’s implementation of the Paris Declaration on Aid
Effectiveness. Discussions on development effectiveness
covered private sector operations and country assistance
programs for Mongolia and the Philippines.

The committee discussed the inaugural Development Effectiveness Review, which was prepared in the
context of ADB’s new results framework. It also reviewed
the work program and budget for OED.

The committee met 11 times in 2008.

Ethics Committee

The Board established the committee to address matters
of ethics that may arise under the Code of Conduct adopted by the Board in September 2006. The code provisions
apply to all Board members (directors, alternate directors,
and temporary alternate directors) and to the President.

‘The committee is responsible for advising directors,
alternate directors, or the President when they request
guidance on actual or potential conflicts of interest or other ethical issues concerning themselves. The committee
also considers any allegations of misconduct against directors, alternate directors, or the President that relate to the
performance of their duties. It recommends appropriate
action to the Board.

The committee held one meeting in 2008, and the
chair met several times with the Office of the General
Counsel to discuss related policies and procedures.

POLICY AND
STRATEGY OVERVIEW

Strategy 2020 sets a strategic direction for ADB with a clearer focus on
poverty reduction through inclusive growth, environmentally sustainable

 

growth, and regional integration. Its implementation is a challenge
requiring substantial resources, knowledge, and expertise. In May, ADB
concluded the ninth replenishment of the Asian Development Fund and
started discussion on a general capital increase. In September, ADB
became the first multilateral development bank to adopt a corporatewide results framework with specific performance indicators and targets.
The framework will serve as a key management tool to monitor ADB’s
performance in realizing its vision of a region free of poverty by 2020.LONG-TERM STRATEGIC
DIRECTIONS

Strategy 2020

n7 April, ADB adopted a new long-term strate
gic framework for 2008-2020. Known as Strat
egy 2020, the framework is based ona thorough
examination of the region’s challenges, a comprehensive
review of ADB’s past and ongoing operations, and extensive stakeholder consultations. Strategy 2020 reaffirms
both ADB’s vision of an Asia and Pacific free of poverty
and ADB’s mission to help developing member countries
reduce poverty and improve living conditions and quality
of life. It also lays out clear directions for planning ADB’s
operations and its organization and business processes to
2020.

‘To achieve its mission, ADB will focus on three strategic agendas: inclusive growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. ADB operations
will emphasize five key drivers of change: private sector
development and operations, good governance and capacity development, gender equity, knowledge solutions, and
partnerships.

Strategy 2020 recognizes that ADB cannot and will
not attempt to meet all needs of all developing member
countries. To maximize results, efficiency, and impact,
ADB will focus its financial and institutional resources in
five core areas that best support its agenda, reflect developing member countries’ needs and ADB’s strengths,
and complement the efforts of development partners.
These five core operational areas are infrastructure;
environment, including climate change; regional cooperation and integration; finance sector development; and
education. In other areas, ADB will continue operations
selectively and in close partnership with other agencies.

ADB will pursue its vision

of an Asia and Pacific region
free of poverty through three
strategic agendas: inclusive
growth, environmentally
sustainable growth, and
regional integration

Annual Report 2008 1

Approved in October, ADB’s work program and budget framework for 2009-2011 outlines how ADB will align
its operations, organization, and resources with Strategy
2020 over the medium term. Alignment of 80% of ADB
operations with the five core operational areas will be
achieved by 2011. Strategy 2020 also sets specific operational and institutional goals, which have been incorporated into ADB’s corporate-wide results framework, which
was formally adopted in September (Toward Greater
Institutional and Development Effectiveness, ADB Results Framework, page 18).

Streamlining and Realigning ADB’s
Policies and Strategies

In tandem with refocusing its operations, ADB will promote greater coherence across its entire operational
policy framework by streamlining its policies and strategies. A comprehensive inventory of all existing strategies and policies has begun, starting with the review of
policies and strategies with substantive implications
for achieving Strategy 2020’s operational goals. Depending on the degree to which they are relevant to
Strategy 2020, ADB’s policies and strategies will be revised, consolidated, or retired. This will enhance ADB’s
operational efficiency, improve client responsiveness, and
optimize the use of institutional resources, resulting in
greater development impact.

RESOURCE MOBILIZATION

Strategy 2020 charts a new strategic course for ADB. Its
successful implementation will require substantial resources in addition to knowledge and expertise.

Review of the 1998 Graduation Policy

ADB has two lending windows for channeling development assistance to its developing member countries: the
Asian Development Fund (ADF) and ordinary capital
resources (OCR). The eligibility criteria for access to both
are stated in ADB’s 1998 graduation policy, a review of
which was completed in April. This review included the
eligibility criteria for ADF and OCR, the country classification framework, and the procedures for graduation
from ADF and OCR; and the country classification re

view process and procedures. While the review concluded that the 1998 graduation policy remains broadly relevant
and useful for guiding resource allocation and contributing to risk management, it also introduced some noteworthy
changes. These include using the term “creditworthiness”
in place of “debt repayment capacity” to ease communication with stakeholders and link ADB’s country classification framework more closely with the creditworthiness
consideration under ADB’s recently approved incomeplanning framework; using a refined methodology to assess
creditworthiness through analysis of both quantitative
and qualitative indicators by a creditworthiness assessment committee; replacing the previous four-tier classification system with a three-tier system that identifies
developing member countries as “ADF only,” “blend,” or
“OCR only;” and further strengthening the classification

review process.

ADF X Replenishment and Follow-Up
Initiatives

In May, ADB successfully concluded negotiations for the
ninth replenishment of ADF (ADF X) and the fourth regularized replenishment of the Technical Assistance Special Fund. These negotiations, held in Madrid, Spain,
resulted in a total replenishment amount of SDR7.1 billion (about $11.3 billion) for ADF X from 1 January 2009 to
31 December 2012. This amount, which is considerably
larger than the ADF resources previously available, will
enable ADB to make a greater contribution to poverty reduction in its lower-income developing member countries
and fulfill its priorities as articulated in Strategy 2020.

In Madrid, donors endorsed the role and priorities
of ADF, both of which are aligned with Strategy 2020.
They also agreed on the allocation rules for ADF X,
including refinements to the performance-based allocation system and the financial management and
framework for ADF X. Discussions emphasized the importance of increasing ADB’s institutional effectiveness as a means of ensuring effective implementation
of the ADF X program. To achieve this objective, the
donors and ADB agreed on a time-bound implementation plan for ADF X. The donors likewise endorsed
an ADF results framework with specific performance
indicators and targets, and results-based performance
reporting that is to be accomplished through annual

development effectiveness reviews. Finally, donors authorized the use of ADF X contributions for grants. ADB
has requested all donors for their consent to amend the
ADF regulations to enable the use of all ADF resources,
including reflows, for grants. Earlier in the year, ADB
also adopted a policy allowing its participation in the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative for debt relief and approved associated relief to Afghanistan.

Optimizing the Use of Ordinary
Capital Resources

Review of ADB’s ordinary capital resource requirements. On
6 May, the Board of Directors reported the status of ADB’s
resources to the Board of Governors. The Board of Directors highlighted the need for a study of ADB’s financial resources. This led to a working paper that assessed ADB’s
financial position over Strategy 2020’s implementation
period and reviewed all possible avenues for resource mobilization. The analysis revealed that withouta robust general
capital increase, ADB would need to significantly reduce its
lending level.

In their discussion of the working paper on 6 October,
the Board of Directors requested a second working paper
that would examine several issues more comprehensively. Examples include further analysis of demand, articulation of a clear strategy to tackle development issues in
middle-income countries, analysis of the ramifications of
an increased level of private sector operations, the progress achieved in carrying out ADB’s institutional reforms,
analysis of all resource mobilization options, and a more
detailed indication of the likely consequences of a delay
in the general capital increase process as well as a contingency plan for addressing these consequences.Review of ADB’s lending and borrowing limitations. During
the Board of Directors’ October meeting, directors requesteda review of ADB’s current interpretation of the lending
limitation as set out in Article 12.1 of ADB’s Charter. In
December, the Board reviewed ADB’s lending limitation
and approved a new lending limitation policy. Under the
policy, the total amount of disbursed loans, approved equity investments, and maximum amount that could be demanded from ADB under its guarantee portfolio must not
exceed the total of ADB’s unimpaired subscribed capital,
reserves, and surplus. The policy allows ADB’s existing

In May, ADB successfully

capital resources to be used more efficiently by reducing
the likelihood that lending headroom will constrain future
OGR operations. The Board also approved a borrowing
limitation policy that prevents ADB’s gross outstanding
borrowings from exceeding the sum of callable capital of
nonborrowing members, paid-in capital, and reserves (including surplus).

The Board approved a revision in the treatment of
ADB guarantees. For purposes of accounting for lending
headroom, guarantees are to be included only as and when
they become payable, and only the actual amount that is
contingently payable is to be included in the calculation.
This revised treatment of ADB guarantees will more effectively leverage ADB’s capital base without negatively
impacting its ability to ensure compliance with the lending limitation.

Review of ADB’s capital adequacy framework. In June, the
Board of Directors approved an enhanced capital adequacy framework. Introduced in 2004, ADB’s risk-based
capital framework was used as the basis for both its capital adequacy assessment and income planning. The 2004
risk-based capital framework used a fixed equity—loan
ratio initially set at 35% as an indicator of capital adequacy. In
contrast, the new risk-based capital framework replaces
the fixed equity—loan ratio witha stress test. This enables
ADB to immediately capture the impact on its capital adequacy of positive and negative changes in portfolio credit
quality. This modification, in turn, allows ADB to moni

tor and plan its equity capital position in advance and thus
avoid being over- or undercapitalized. ADB’s new capital
adequacy framework was reviewed by credit agencies and
found to be consistent with the practices of other multilateral development banks.

TOWARD GREATER
INSTITUTIONAL AND
DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS

Strategy 2020 lays out the corporate pathway for reshaping
ADB intoa more effective and innovative development institution. However, many organizational changes outlined
in Strategy 2020 build on the gains in institutional effectiveness that ADB achieved through the reform agenda it
adopted in 2004. The key reforms that ADB implemented
in 2008 are summarized below.

ADB Results Framework

In September, ADB became the first multilateral development bank to adopt a corporate-wide results framework. The framework consists of specific performance
indicators and targets that fall into four groups: Asia—
Pacific outcomes, contribution to country outcomes
through key outputs, operational effectiveness, and organizational effectiveness (page 19).

While preparing the results framework was a comprehensive exercise that drew on a considerable amount
of internal and external consultation, ADB will continue to refine its results framework over time on the basis of experience gained through its use. Overall, the
purpose of the results framework is to focus ADB operations on development effectiveness as visualized by
Strategy 2020 and promote a culture of results and performance management throughout the institution. It
will thus be a key management tool in implementing
Strategy 2020.

Development Effectiveness Review

One of the first tangible outputs of the results framework
was ADB’s first annual development effectiveness review,
which was completed in November. The purpose of the
review was to assess ADB’s performance in achieving the

desired results and identify effectiveness issues requiring
attention as well as actions for dealing with them. Management will regularly monitor the progress of such actions to
ensure that they lead to improved operational effectiveness. As with the ADB results framework, the development effectiveness review will be refined over time.

Accra High-Level Forum
on Aid Effectiveness

ADB continued to implement and monitor its own progress toward the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness
commitments. ADB was a sponsor of and key participant
in the Third High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness held
in Accra, Ghana, in September. The forum’s major outputs included reaffirmation by the entire development
community of the efficacy of the Paris Declaration and its

 

The Accra Agenda for Action

The Accra Agenda for Action identifies three major
challenges to accelerating progress in aid effectiveness:
enhanced country ownership, more effective and
inclusive partnerships, and achievement of development
results and accountability for them. Necessary actions
identified by the agenda include enhancing the role of
civil society organizations, the private sector, and other
stakeholders in the development process; encouraging
south-south cooperation; developing capacity in partner
countries to ensure leadership of the development
agenda and adequate use of country systems; achieving
better division of labor between development partners;
following good practices in international engagement
in fragile and conflict situations; and delivering and
accounting for results.

Many of the above issues are addressed by recent ADB
initiatives, as they are specifically referred to in Strategy
2020. As a result, ADB has already incorporated many of
the actions identified by the Accra Agenda for Action.Annual Report 2008 19

 

ADB’s Results Framework

Strategy 2020 includes development of a results framework for monitoring ADB's performance in realizing its
vision of a region free of poverty by 2020. ADB's results
framework is in harmony with the results measurement
systems of the International Development Association and
the African Development Fund. It likewise contributes to
the fulfillment of ADB's Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness, harmonization, and alignment commitments. The
results framework is an important management tool for
monitoring development effectiveness, and for promoting
continuing operational and institutional improvement.

ADB's results framework has four levels:

Level 1: Asia-Pacific outcomes. The region’s development progress is tracked through major outcomes to which
ADB and its development partners contribute, including
gross domestic product per capita, indicators of poverty
and human development, regional cooperation and
integration, access to basic infrastructure, governance,
and environmental sustainability.

Level 2: Contribution to country outcomes through
key outputs. ADB's contribution to country and regional
outcomes is assessed through key outputs delivered to
developing member countries through ADB projects in
sectors given priority by Strategy 2020: education, energy,
finance, transport, and water.

principles; discussion of the expanded aid effectiveness
agenda, including its political economy dimensions; and
the Accra Agenda for Action (page 18).

‘Together with its development partners, ADB is
working to localize the Paris Declaration in Asia and the
Pacific. ADB measures the progress achieved via its own
monitoring survey of Paris Declaration implementation.
The second phase of the monitoring survey covers 17
countries, including three OCR borrowers.

As indicated in Strategy 2020,
the purpose of the technical
assistance reform program

is to strengthen ADB’s role

as a knowledge institution to
allow delivery of high-quality
technical assistance with
tangible development impact

Level 3: Operational effectiveness. Improving ADB's
operational performance increases its contribution to country
outcomes. ADB's operational performance is measured by
indicators falling into five major categories: operational
quality and portfolio performance, financial mobilization,
strategic focus in operations, knowledge development, and
partnerships.

Level 4: Organizational effectiveness. ADB’s progress
in improving efficiency in the use of its internal resources,
and in implementing reforms essential to maintaining
its relevance, its focus on results, and its contribution to
development effectiveness is measured by three major
categories of indicators: use of human resources, use of
budgetary resources, and business processes and practices.

The results framework is

a management tool for

effectiveness, and promoting
continuing operational and
institutional improvement

Increasing the Impact of ADB’s Technical
Assistance Program

In May, the Board of Directors approved a paper outlining a
reform program to increase the development effectiveness
of ADB’s technical assistance operations. As indicated in
Strategy 2020, the purpose of the reform program is to
strengthen ADB’s role as a knowledge institution to allow
delivery of high-quality technical assistance with tangible
development impact. This is to be achieved by greater synergy between ADB lending and nonlending products at the
country and regional levels, and greater developing member country involvement and ownership at all levels. The
reform program is to be implemented over 2008-2011.

The various types of technical assistance to be offered
by ADB were redefined as capacity development, policy
and advisory, project preparatory, and research and development. As mandated in Strategy 2020, ADB is to engage
in research activities that provide knowledge support to
its developing member countries, best achieved through
research and development technical assistance. At its first

of Strategy 2020

strategic forum held in August, ADB established five strategic priorities for guiding ADB’s research and development technical assistance: promote inclusive growth, deal
with climate change for sustainable development, facilitate knowledge for regional integration, support efforts to
tackle rising food and commodity prices, and assess and
respond to demographic change. These strategic priorities likewise provide a means of establishing knowledge
partnerships with external partners such as development
institutions, research institutes, and private and civil society organizations.

Review of Resident Missions’ Operations

In September, ADB completed its review of resident mission operations to identify options for improvement in

both the short and medium term. The review drew on the
findings of an October 2007 special evaluation study of
the resident mission policy and related operations by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED).

The review concluded that the 2000 resident mission
policy succeeded in reorienting the work of the resident
missions from a primary focus on project administration
to a wider range of functions involving all aspects of ADB
operations. Evidence from a number of sources suggests
that decentralization has positively impacted on ADB operations, thereby justifying the corresponding increase in
both staff numbers and budgets of the resident missions.
This finding is consistent with OED’s special evaluation
study, which concluded that the resident mission policy
was successful.

‘The review pointed to several areas where implementation of the resident mission policy could be strengthened, including identifying arrangements that would
enable greater integration of the activities of headquarters and resident missions, further adjusting the number
and skills mix of staffin selected resident missions to align
with functional requirements, strengthening incentives
for resident mission postings for both local and international staff, and further expanding bandwidth and improving connectivity.

The major conclusions of the review were that with
some strengthening, the resident mission policy is sufficiently robust to support implementation of Strategy 2020;and further delegation of responsibilities to resident missions is desirable, provided the improvements suggested
are undertaken. To better position resident missions to
implement Strategy 2020 successfully, the review recommended expanding resident missions’ role in knowledge
production and dissemination, strengthening resident
mission skills in private sector development and nonsovereign operations, and clarifying resident missions’ role
with respect to regional cooperation and integration.

Mainstreaming the Multitranche
Financing Facility and Expanding
Nonsovereign Operations

Under the innovation and efficiency initiative, new financing instruments and modalities were approved in
August 2005. Some were implemented on a pilot basis
from September 2005 to August 2008 to allow ADB’s management and Board of Directors to assess their viability,
relevance, effectiveness, and uptake. The status of each
new modality is as follows:

¢ The multitranche financing facility was mainstreamed into ADB’s financing operations in July because of high demand and portfolio size, as well as
the assessment that the instrument has created efficiency in implementing sovereign lending through
shorter processing times and cost savings. As of
31 December, 29 multitranche financing facilities—
representing total available financing of $15.1 billion—had been approved.

¢ The pilot period for the subsovereign and nonsovereign public sector financing facilities were extended
to 31 August 2011. Although the nonsovereign public sector financing facility is fully aligned with Strategy 2020, more time and transactions are required
to evaluate both its ability to meet client needs and
the efficiency and effectiveness of its delivery. As of
31 December, seven nonsovereign public sector
financing facilities—representing total available
financing of $1.4 billion—had been approved. Three,
however, were canceled.

¢ The refinancing facility, as defined in the pilot paper
of 2005, was discontinued.

¢ Alocal currency loan mechanism was introduced into
core ADB lending operations in August 2005 as an al
Annual Report 2008 21

ternative to US-dollar loans based on the London interbank offered rate. Local currency loans have since
been extended to nonsovereign borrowers. As of
31 December, local currency loans were available to
the People’s Republic of China, India, Indonesia,
Kazakhstan, and Philippines.

¢ Syndication and risk-sharing policy and operating
frameworks were developed further since the introduction of the innovation and efficiency initiative, and
were mainstreamed into ADB’s financing operations.

With the mainstreaming of all areas under the innovation and efficiency initiative except for the nonsovereign public sector financing facility, the initiative’s
mandate and scope are now deemed completed.

Safeguard Policy Update

The purpose of the ongoing safeguard policy update is to
strengthen the relevance and enhance the effectiveness
of ADB’s safeguard policies (environment, indigenous
peoples, and involuntary resettlement). The policy update is intended to better articulate the safeguard policies to improve their clarity, coherence, and consistency;
achieve a better balance between a front-loaded procedural approach and attention to delivery of results during
project implementation; adapt policy implementation to
an evolving range of lending products and innovative financing modalities; work toward greater harmonization
with the safeguard practices of other multilateral financial
institutions and tailor safeguard approaches to different
clients with varying levels of capacity; and improve internal processes and resource allocation.

Between October 2007 and April 2008, ADB conducted 14 consultation workshops in developing and developed member countries on the consultation draft of the
safeguard policy statement. ADB received widespread
feedback and detailed suggestions. A second draft of the

safeguard policy statement was made available for public
comment in October, and a multistakeholder consultation
on the second draft was held in Manila in November. A
working paper on the safeguard policy statement was circulated to the Board of Directors for guidance and posted
on ADB’s website in January 2009.

Review of the Independence and
Effectiveness of the Operations
Evaluation Department

In February, ADB committed to a comprehensive review of
its Operations Evaluation Department (OED). An ad hoc
working group, chaired by an executive director and comprising two additional executive directors and the managing
director general, was created to undertake the review. Two
external experts were engaged to assist in the process.

The review concluded that while ADB has a clearly articulated model of independent evaluation, OED’s
credibility as an independent evaluation unit could be
furtherenhanced by adopting the following measures: expanding the nonrenewable term of OED’s director general from 3 to 5 years; allowing OED’s director general to
be appointed by the Board of Directors upon recommendation by the Development Effectiveness Committee
in consultation with the President; strengthening the
selection process for OED’s director general with the
Development Effectiveness Committee leading the process and using an executive search firm and extensive
media advertising; exempting OED’s director general
from the formal performance review process, with his or
her salary determined bya formula; allowing OED’s budget to be approved by the Board of Directors separately
from ADB’s overall administrative budget; and renaming OED the Independent Evaluation Department to reflect its more independent status. To further strengthen
the department’s effectiveness, the review urged that
interaction between the department and operations
staff be intensified to ensure ownership of evaluation
results and accelerate the application of lessons learned;
and that a more rigorous system for monitoring the progress achieved in implementing the department’s recommendations be put in place.

A revised policy was approved by the Board on
15 December to give effect to the changes referred to
above. This policy supersedes the 2003 policy on enhanc
ing the independence and effectiveness of the department and the 2008 amendment of terms of appointment
of the director general, with effect from 1 January 2009.

Review of ADB’s Human Resources
Strategy

Under the human resources strategy (2005-2007), ADB
committed to conducting a review following the 3-year
implementation period. The review, which was undertaken with the assistance of external experts, underscored the importance of linking ADB’s human resources
management to its business strategy to support and deliver the results required by Strategy 2020 (Finance and
Administration, Human Resources, page 103). A Board
paper on the subject was issued in December. As a next
step, a detailed action plan will be drawn up, based on the
external experts’ recommendations and the Board’s comments, among other inputs.

Disclosure

Since approval of its public communications policy in April
2005, ADB has become much more transparent in the way
it communicates with the public and shares information
with its stakeholders, particularly about ADB projects. In
2005, ADB disclosed on its website 876 operational documents; in 2008, the number increased by 70% to 1,512.
Postings of project summary pages—the primary source of
information about ADB operations—increased by 13% in
2008 alone. Overall, timeliness of disclosure has improved
significantly since the policy’s approval.

Policy and strategy papers, agendas, and minutes of
meetings of ADB’s Board of Directors, and summaries of
Board discussions on strategy, policies, and regional and
country partnership strategies were freely available to the
public, as were documents prepared in the normal course
of project design and implementation, including environ
mental assessments.

Staff members were routinely briefed on the public
communications policy, both to update knowledge about
the policy and respond to staff turnover. Awarenessraising seminars on the policy were conducted for about

100 development partners, including officials of develop
ing member countries and civil society organizations, at
ADB headquarters and in Nepal. The public information
and disclosure unit responded to all external requests in 7
days on average, the maximum time limit allowed by the
policy being 30 days.

MalAdsAO ADALVALS GNV ADINOd |FINANCING
OPERATIONS

ADB raised $9.4 billion through public issues and private placements,
with $10.5 billion in loans approved for 86 projects. Thirteen
nonsovereign loans were made to the private sector for $1.5 billion,
107% more than the $715.3 million in the previous year, and resources
of $4.3 billion were transferred from ADB to its developing member
countries, compared with $3.2 billion in 2007.uthorized and subscribed capital stock amount
ed to $54.9 billion. Ordinary capital resourc

revenue and net realized gains, amounted to $2.0 billion,
$1.4 billion of which was generated from the loan portfolio, $652.3 million from the investment portfolio, and
$25.7 million from other sources.

ADB’s Special Funds are the Asian Development
Fund (ADF) with 2008 committed contributions and revenue totaling $0.7 billion, Technical Assistance Special Fund
of $41.3 million, Japan Special Fund of $23.9 million, ADB
Institute Special Fund of $8.1 million, Asian Tsunami Fund
of $9.3 million, Pakistan Earthquake Fund of $13.5 million,
Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund of $1.3 million,
and Climate Change Fund of $40.6 million.

FUNDING

ADB raised $9.4 billion in medium- and long-term funds
through public issues and private placements. Public
offerings amounted to $4.8 billion, of which $2.3 billion
was through two US-dollar global benchmarks. Private
placements totaled $4.6 billion.

OVERVIEW OF OPERATIONS

ADB approved 98 loans (86 projects) for $10.5 billion,

LOANS

Sovereign lending amounted to $8.7 billion for 83 loans
(72 projects or programs) , comprising 46 loans from ADB’s
OCR for $6.9 billion and 37 loans from ADF for $1.8 billion. These amounts include 14 OCR loans for $1.8 billion and 5 ADF loans for $178.0 million from multitranche
financing facilities. Overall, sovereign lending of $8.7 billion approved in 2008 decreased by about 6% compared to
$9.2 billion approved in 2007 (a decrease of about 6% for
both OCR and ADF lending). Two nonsovereign public sector loans to state-owned enterprises for $300.0 million were
approved. Thirteen nonsovereign loans (12 projects) to the
private sector for $1.5 billion were also approved—107%
more than the $715.3 million for 18 loans (18 projects) in 2007.

Of the 86 projects and programs approved in 2008, 69
(80%) were general interventions and 17 (20%) were targeted interventions. Sustainable economic growth was the
most prevalent theme and was associated with 70 projects.
‘Transport and communications, among the sectors, received the largest share of lending (26%).

The 72 investment projects approved in 2008 will result
in total investments of about $34.1 billion—$8.1 billion (24%)
will be financed by ADB; $9.3 billion (27%) by governments
and borrowers; $15.8 billion (46%) by cofinanciers, equity
sponsors, and local financial institutions; and $946.9 million
(3%) by project beneficiaries. Four projects, amounting to
$279.3 million, are financed under sector lending, compared
with five projects amounting to $503.2 million in 2007.

The 14 policy-based programs approved in 2008 were
valued at $2.49 billion, compared with 13 programs for
$2.46 billion in 2007.

EQUITY OPERATIONS

Seven equity investments for $123.1 million were approved
in 2008, compared with five for $79.8 million in 2007.

COFINANCING AND CREDIT
ENHANCEMENT OPERATIONS

Cofinancing was further integrated more formally into the
2009-2011 work programming and planning cycle and in annual operations review planning. A programmatic approach
through framework agreements indicating areas for cooperation was more vigorously pursued. In addition, projectspecific cooperation was further streamlined through the
introduction of standardized cofinancing agreement templates. These approaches facilitated moving cofinancing
upstream and provided greater predictability, beginning
with an institutional understanding of major cofinancing
partners’ areas of cooperation and resource commitments,
and, at the country programming stage, the identification
of projects to be potentially cofinanced. The level of direct
value-added (DVA) cofinancing against ADB’s own lending was also introduced in 2008 as one of the indicators of
ADB’s development effectiveness in mobilizing additional

resources for it

 

sisted projects.

Total DVA cofinancing amounted to about $1.7 billion for 101 projects, of which $1.6 billion was for 25
investment projects and $84.2 million was for 76 technical assistance projects. DVA cofinancing for invest
ment projects comprised $925.0 million for 6 official loan
cofinancing operations, $565.0 million in B-loans for 3
projects, $10.0 million for 1 guarantee operation, and
$70.0 million for 17 grant operations (Tables 4a and 4b).
Moreover, about $14.0 billion discrete (non-DVA) cofinancing in the form of parallel loans and grants was expected for
21 ADB-financed projects and programs.

Three framework cofinancing agreements with the
Government of the Republic of Korea and one with the
Islamic Development Bank were signed. ADB worked
closely on implementing the Accelerated Co-Financing
Scheme of Japan with ADB and held discussions with
Japan on refining the operation of the scheme. Efforts to
match cofinanciers’ priorities and regional departments’
cofinancing requirements were stepped up, helping ensure prompt commitment of funds under these frameworks.

ADB further aligned its resource mobilization efforts
by establishing trust and special funds that support the
development agenda of Strategy 2020. A new initiative,
the Future Carbon Fund, was established during the year
to support projects that will use carbon credits generated beyond 2012 to provide urgently needed financing for
clean energy projects in Asia and the Pacific. The initial
target size of the fund is $100 million and may be increased
to $200 million if uptake is sufficient. A special fund, the
Climate Change Fund, which aims to slow the onset of
climate change and help Asia and the Pacific adapt to the
expected devastating impact of global warming, was alsoAnnual Report 2008 27

ADB’s sector and thematic priorities promote quality, knowledge, and
innovation for inclusive and sustainable development.REALIGNING FOR COHERENCE
AND COHESIVENESS

he mandate of the Regional and Sustainable De
velopment Department is to ensure corporate co
herence in ADB’s sector and thematic operations,
and advance the knowledge and practices that underpin
them. The department’s strategic focus on enhancing key
infrastructure sector operations, promoting sustainability
and social inclusiveness, introducing innovative approaches, and facilitating knowledge management remained unchanged, but the department realigned its structure along
sector and thematic lines to champion Strategy 2020.
‘The new structure brought together related sectors and
themes; created a climate change program coordination
unit; and established an agriculture, rural development,
and food security unit.

By means of its new structure and associated webbased relationships and processes, the department
engaged the operations departments more proactively in
country and regional programming. A greater degree of
engagement was likewise achieved in the processing and
administration of projects, communities of practice, steering committees, working groups, and task forces. Other
new activities and engagement mechanisms included
organizing seminars, hosting training and capacity development, and collaborating with regional knowledge hubs.

TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE

Strategy 2020 aims to help developing member countries
mitigate and adapt to climate change. ADB Management
therefore established the climate change coordination
unit in the Regional and Sustainable Development Department.

ADB made notable progress in its clean energy initiatives, surpassing the $1 billion annual lending target
set in 2005. It began to shift transport and urban investments to low-carbon alternatives, and established financing schemes in three areas: mobilizing concessional funds,
catalyzing private sector capital, and maximizing the use
of market mechanisms.

ADB helped establish the Climate Investment Funds
and provided supplementary financing through its Clean
Energy Financing Facility, with contributions from Aus

projects

tralia, Japan, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. ADB’s Board of
Directors approved the transfer of ADB’s own net income
to the Climate Change Fund. In addition to many lowcarbon projects financed by the Private Sector Operations
Department, ADB invested $100 million as seed capital
to help set up five private sector equity funds for clean
energy projects, an investment that will likely catalyze
$1 billion in additional private sector capital.

Through the carbon market initiative, ADB provided
upfront financing and technical support for more than
40 mitigation projects. In July, the Board of Directors
approved the Future Carbon Fund.

ADB drew up a climate change adaptation program
to help the region’s economies mainstream adaptation
and enhance their resilience to adverse impacts. It incorporates vulnerability risk management into countries’
national development strategies and actions, increases
the climate resilience of vulnerable sectors, climateproofs projects, and deals with the social dimensions of
climate change. Achievements included the design of five
climate change risk-reduction projects financed through
the Climate Change Fund, and approval of eight grants
to implement adaptation interventions in nine developing
member countries.

ADB also helped countries prepare climate change
implementation plans to pave the way to incorporate mitigation and adaptation interventions into country partnership strategies.

INFRASTRUCTURE

Sector and thematic work on infrastructure was completed in water, transport, the urban sector, energy, and information and communication technology, with noteworthy
deliverables in the first three areas. Loans approved under the Water Financing Program (2006-2010) totaled
$1.7 billion in 2008, an amount more than double the 2007

level of $0.7 billion. In support of the Water Financing
Program, the Water Financing Partnership Facility became fully operational, with contributions being committed from Australia, Austria, Netherlands, Norway, and
Spain. A dozen water knowledge hubs relating to urban
water management were confirmed. These relate to
disaster risk reduction and flood management, water and
climate change adaptation in Southeast Asia, river basin
organization and management, water quality management in river basins, decision support systems for river basin management (hydroinformatics), water governance,
integrated water resource management in Central Asia,
integrated water resource management in the Pacific,
erosion and sedimentation in river basins, healthy rivers
and aquatic ecosystems, water resource management in
mountainous regions, and irrigation service reform. In the
energy sector, the energy-for-all initiative was launched to
develop new approaches and methodologies for promoting greater access to reliable and affordable modern energy
services for the region’s poor.

The highlight of ADB’s sector and thematic work on
transport was the September Transport Forum on the
theme of Asia on the Move: Energy Efficient and Inclusive
(www.adb.org/documents/events/2008/adbtransport-forum-2008), which was presented in collabo
‘Transport

ration with the Global Transport Knowledge Partnership
and the South East Asia Community Access Programme.
Attended by more than 250 participants from over 30
countries, the forum generated and disseminated knowledge solutions relating to urban mobility, rural transport,
transport and climate change, governance in transport,
social development and inclusive transport, road safety,
and public-private partnerships.

Lastly, ADB’s views on the urban sector were shared
widely through large-scale participation at the Fourth
World Urban Forum in Nanjing, People’s Republic of

China, in November, and were simultaneously enriched
by strategic technical assistance for managing Asian cities
and sustainable urban development in Asia. The scope
of the first technical assistance activity was expanded
to include identifying and preparing projects in a dozen
cities for possible financing by ADB and other partners
under the Cities Development Initiative for Asia, key
partners among which are Germany, Spain, and Sweden.
Throughout the year, in-house seminars were used to
disseminate key findings.

INCLUSIVE SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT

Incorporating Gender into ADB’s
Operations

ADB started implementing its gender and development
plan of action (2008-2010) in January. It supports accelerating the integration of gender into country partnership strategies and projects, improving policy dialogue
and capacity support to developing member countries,
and increasing organizational effectiveness. In July, the
President accepted the Millennium Development Goal
3 Gender Equality Torch and announced ADB’s greater
commitment to gender equality in the region. Country
gender assessments were completed for Pakistan, Philippines, and Sri Lanka. ADB continued its established
practice of monitoring the share of projects that have a
significant gender component, aiming for 40% of ADBwide public sector projects and 50% of Asian Development Fund projects by 2012.

Fostering Participation

ADB continued to update knowledge on consultation
and participation through training and dialogue on thematic and sector assessments. Implementation of
consultation and participation strategies improved the
design and implementation of projects and technical
assistance initiatives and strengthened stakeholder ownership and project sustainability. ADB published From
the Ground Up: Case Studies in Community Empowerment
(www.adb.org/documents/books/ground-up-communityempowerment/ground-up-community-empowerment.
pdf).Social Protection

Investment in social protection remained an important
feature of promoting inclusive growth. ADB supported social protection interventions through loans and technical
assistance. It eased policy dialogues and research and disseminated information and knowledge on social protection
and safety nets. In August, ADB approved regional technical assistance to improve social protection initiatives in developing member countries, which will help them develop
and adopt social protection policies and programs.

Community-Driven Development

Acting on recommendations made in A Review of Community-Driven Development and Its Application to the Asian
Development Bank (www.adb.org/documents/participation/
review-cdd-application-adb.pdf), technical assistance
for supporting community-driven development was approved. This approval led to inception and implementation
support for community-driven development activities in

developing member countries’ environmental legal and
institutional frameworks; support interventions to tackle global and regional environmental issues; collaborate
with development partners; promote knowledge management; and integrate environmental and social safeguards
in projects.

These efforts resulted in environmental lending to
26 projects with a total value of about $2,607 million—a
nearly 200% increase from 2007 in terms of loan value, and
the highest since 1995. The projects include those that
are expected to reduce CO, emissions through wind and
hydropower energy projects in India, People’s Republic
of China (PRC), and Viet Nam. Other projects approved
in the PRC will reduce water pollution, conserve biodiversity, and combat land degradation. Projects approved
in India and the PRC are also expected to reduce air and
water pollution and improve water supply, sanitation,
and solid waste management systems. Projects approved
in Georgia, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka will promote environmentally sustainable approaches to agriculture.

More than 50 technical assistance projects, approved
for almost $100 million, are expected to deal with the
environment, including climate change-related issues.
Other approved projects will design a sulfur dioxide
trading system, prepare guidelines for payment for environmental services in river basins, provide seed funding
for renewable energy and energy projects, and promote
coastal and marine resource conservation in the Coral
‘Triangle—the center of the world’s coral reef biological
diversity—which spans six developing member countries.

ADB continued to work with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to prepare projects for GEF’s
endorsement, and mobilize financing for the Coral Triangle Initiative. It supported the Clean Air Initiative
for Asian Cities’ annual workshop on air quality and climate change, and hosted the meeting of the Poverty and

EDUCATION AND SKILLS

Strategy 2020 confirms that inclusive growth requires
investments in and access to education and vocational
training. ADB completed Education and Skills: Strategies for
Accelerated Development in Asia and the Pacific (www.adb.org/
Documents/Studies/Education-Skills-Strategies-Development), a major study that analyzes the lessons, gaps,
and policy challenges facing education, including equity,
relevance, efficiency, and affordability. The study concludes that inclusive growth depends on the continuous
development of an adequate human resources base, and
provides a strategic framework for ADB’s work. ADB continued to provide program and project lending to a range
of countries, including preparing support for an important
and innovative postharvest technology and skills-bridgingprogram for the rural poor in Cambodia, early childhood
education for nomadic and migrant children in Mongolia, polytechnic support in Indonesia, and capacity development for madrasah education in Bangladesh. ADB also
published Skilling the Pacific: Technical and Vocational Education and Training in the Pacific (www.adb.org/Documents/
Books/Skilling-Pacific/Skilling-Pacific.pdf), a comprehensive and influential knowledge product.

IMPROVING HEALTH ACCESS AND
OUTCOMES

‘Tangible progress was made in implementing Strategy
2020. The President approved the Operational Plan for
Improving Health Access and Outcomes (www.adb.org/
Documents/Policies/Strategy2020/Operational-PlanFor-Health.pdf), which sets out where, why, and how ADB
will do things differently. ADB approved strategically focused program loans, including $400 million to Pakistan
to achieve the Millennium Development Goals related to
maternal and child health, and one to the Philippines to
reform health financing. ADB significantly strengthened
partnerships that provide regional public goods. Related
actions included formal collaboration with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations
Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and the World
Bank on a data hub for HIV/AIDS; costing tools for HIV/
AIDS; joint case studies on preventing and mitigating
HIV/AIDS in infrastructure; and collaboration with the
Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health
Organization on building capacity to prepare for pandemics and control communicable diseases. ADB also analyzed
the economics and financing of maternal, newborn, and
child health, identifying “best buys” for increased, more
cost-effective, and more equitable financing of essential
health care for women and their children

DISASTER AND EMERGENCY
ASSISTANCE

In April, management approved an action plan supporting
the policy governing disaster and emergency assistance.
Components of the action plan include identifying disaster risks as part of country programming, building country

disaster and hazard management capacity, taking disaster management and climate change issues into account
when developing country programs or designing projects,
and assisting regional disaster risk management coordination and institutionalization. At the Oslo Policy Forum,
ADB staff members learned ways of mainstreaming disaster risk management and climate change adaptation into
development programs.

Following the earthquake in Sichuan Province, at
the request of the Government of the People’s Republic of China, ADB prepared policy notes that assisted
the recovery program; technical assistance was also provided. Disasters resulted in ADB participation in damage
and needs assessments in several developing member
countries, including the Kyrgyz Republic, Lao People’s
Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Nepal. Both
the conflict in Georgia and food security issues in
Bangladesh and Cambodia were relieved by emergency
assistance loans. A conference on catastrophe risk insurance for Asia and the Pacific was cosponsored with the
Ministry of Finance of Japan in Tokyo.

GOVERNANCE AND
ANTICORRUPTION INITIATIVES

ADB achieved significant progress in promoting good
governance and fighting corruption through its second
governance and anticorruption action plan. The plan is
being implemented by incorporating risk assessments
into country partnership strategies and project documents. In line with its commitment to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, ADB’s international, national,
and local efforts included maximizing the impact from use
of its resources, reinforcing the achievement of goals, and
avoiding duplication. Regional and subregional initiatives
were limited but promising.

ADB helped improve regional transport connectivity, energy security, basic

urban services, and the business climate for private sector investment and

trade. New regional cooperation agreements were reached. Lending was
close to $2.5 billion; disbursements exceeded $2.0 billion, a record by

ADB in this region.

OVERVIEW

he ADB strategic stance in the region targets

basic infrastructure (transport networks, lo
gistics, and irrigation facilities); power and
energy; urban services (water, sanitation, waste
management, and urban transport); and public sector reforms (banking, nonbanking and financial resource management). ADB responded to long-term
investment needs and also to short-term financing
gaps in Georgia and Pakistan. Lending was close to
$2.5 billion, with disbursements at $2.2 billion, a
record high. ADB’s nonsovereign approvals in the
region totaled $70.0 million plus an estimated portion of $5.0 million from the Equity Investment in
Asian Clean Energy Private Equity Funds, a regional project (Statistical Annex 10). The quality of the
portfolio improved because of better project management. ADB operated mainly through investment programs rather than stand-alone projects.
This increased efficiency and improved project
management. ADB also increased its proximity to

clients through new offices in Armenia and Georgia
and delegated more authority and people to field
offices. The 7th Ministerial Conference on Central Asia Regional Cooperation (CAREC), held in
Baku, Azerbaijan, deepened economic cooperation
among the participating countries with new agreements on energy, transport, and trade. A flagship
regional transport project was approved, creating
a major east-west corridor through Kazakhstan.
This will better connect all neighboring countries
and open the way for future north-south corridors
through Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan. It will
also open routes into the Caspian and Black Sea.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

ADB increased contract awards and disbursements. By year-end, it exceeded annual targets for
contract awards ($2.1 billion) and disbursements
($2.2 billion). ADB redoubled efforts to restructure its project and technical assistance portfolio,
especially in Pakistan.CENTRAL AND WEST ASIA |

38 Asian Development Bank

ADB improved portfolio management by introducing
early warning systems; using better project management
tools; and discontinuing automatic extensions of loans
and technical assistance More authority was delegated
to resident missions, and field staff expanded. New working arrangements between field and headquarter teams

were set up.

COUNTRY HIGHLIGHTS
Afghanistan

Partnership priorities. Development partners pledged
$14 billion in new assistance, adding to $6 billion carried over from earlier pledges. The Afghanistan National
Development Strategy paved the way for interim debt
relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. ADB’s Board of Governors approved the use of ADF
for debt relief.

The country partnership strategy (2009-2013) confirmed ADB’s commitment to economic development
through investments in energy, transport, and irrigation.

Impact of operations. Seventeen sovereign loan and
grant projects remained under implementation; several
projects were delayed because of poor security, weak government capacity, and bid and contract difficulties. Construction continued on the national ring road and north—
south corridor, improving transport and easing domestic
and regional trade and transit. Technical assistance to
counterpart agencies supported institutional and capacity development. A transmission line was completed between Uzbekistan and Kabul, increasing electricity supply in the city from 2 to 12 hours a day, making a major

difference to people and businesses.
Armenia

Partnership priorities. Priorities included transport and
water services. ADB also partnered with the government

on governance and anticorruption risk assessments and

 

definition of associated mitigation measures.

An ADB-supported project is helping women like Ms.
Gulzat join together, combine their skills and experience,
and start small handicraft-making businesses. In her
10-member group, each woman supports at least three
children. Working together, they teach each other new

has five children. “This is an excellent opportunity for
us to improve ourselves and express our creativity. | am
earning money now that | couldn't if | was only working at home.”

The ADB and Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction project that assists the people of Janbulak village seeks to
improve livelihoods of rural women by developing handicraft industries. The project helps the government organize existing, mostly informal, rural handicraft centers.

When the Urmat Uz Cooperative Society was
launched, 15 women were working on handicrafts.
With the support of the ADB project, that number has
grown to 120 today.

“Traditionally, the women of this area have been
engaged in handicrafts,” says Jamby Karybekova, who
heads the organization. “| invite these women to join
our group, and they even bring their daughters along.
It is a chance for them to get out of poverty.”

Another cooperative that has benefited from the
project is located in the village of Talas. This group
brings together single mothers, including those with
disabled children.

“It is very difficult for them to raise their kids,” said
Ibadad Ergeshova, who heads the cooperative. “They
don't have land or a business. After training with our
cooperative, they make their own handicraft designs. So
far, everybody has been pleased with the quality of the
work. This project provides a lot of help for women.”

“They don't have any financial means to survive, but
they are ready to learn and they want to work.”

Easing the Burden

of Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province,
Bashiran Bibi once spent hours everyday collecting
and carrying water on her head in heavy pots.

The water often came from uncovered wells, filthy
rivers and streams, and stagnant ponds, putting their
and their families’ health at risk.

But—thanks to a project jointly funded by ADB and
the provincial government—clean water and sanitation
are now available to 2.5 million rural Punjabis.

The change has not just improved the health of
many communities. It has also empowered women,
freeing them from a back-breaking chore to engage in
other more productive tasks.

| ike other women and girls in the rural heartland

 

Traditional water collection practices were time-consuming and
physically demanding, and handled by women

“By fetching water 3 to 4 hours a day in scorching
heat and carrying the pitchers on our heads, many of
us were losing so much hair we were going bald,” said
Bibi, chairperson of the Women Community Organization in Dera Ghazi Khan. “We had to carry water even
when we were pregnant.”

The statistics on access to clean water and sanitation in rural Pakistan make for grim reading.

Of the country’s population of 160 million, 84 million live in Punjab and about 60% of that number are
rural dwellers. Half of this large rural group is forced to
draw water from unsafe sources.

In a bid to address these issues, ADB joined the
Punjab government on a project to fund water supply
and drainage facilities for 1,085 rural communities. An
initial ADB loan of $46 million in 1995 was followed by
another $50 million in 2002.

The positive economic impact of freeing women
and girls from their water collection chore to engage in
other activities is unequivocal. Another beneficial spinoff is that girls now have time to attend school.

“| have started going to school for the first time
and | like it. | don’t mind sitting in class with girls several years younger. My mother and | used to fetch water. | started fetching water when | was only 5 years

Regional cooperation is a core element of the People’s Republic of China’s

country partnership strategy with ADB and will also be prominent in

Mongolia’s new strategy. A high priority for ADB will be building cross
border infrastructure in both countries for better connectivity with Central

Asia Regional Economic Cooperation members and the Greater Mekong

Subregion.

OVERVIEW

DB’s operations in East Asia were fully
aligned with Strategy 2020’s core priorities
and focused on achieving environmentally sustainable inclusive growth. Private sector development remained a strategic priority in both the
People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Mongolia.
Further, ADB endeavored to promote nonsovereign
lending and private—public partnerships in infrastructure. In both countries’ finance sectors, ADB focused
on providing technical assistance to increase access
to financial services, improve financial infrastructure,
and facilitate trade among neighboring countries.
East Asia sovereign lending operations (Table
18) comprised 13 loans to the PRC for $1.5 billion,
and five Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants to
Mongolia for $74.3 million. In addition, Mongolia
also received $8.0 million from Japan Fund for
Poverty Reduction for four projects covering local
roads, energy conservation, water supply for the poor,
and community-based natural resource management.

ADB provided $28.1 million in technical assistance
consisting of $19.5 million for the PRC, $5.5 million
for Mongolia, and $3.2 million for regional technical
assistance. ADB’s nonsovereign approvals in the region totaled $424.1 million plus an estimated portion
of $45.0 million from the Equity Investment in Asian
Clean Energy Private Equity Funds, a regional project
(Statistical Annex 10). The $424.1 million includes a
$200 million B-loan provided by commercial lenders
with ADB acting as lender of record.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

ADB has been making sustained efforts to promote
results-based portfolio management, monitoring,
and evaluation in East Asia. Notable initiatives in
the PRC included assistance to the National Development and Reform Commission to establish a
results-based project monitoring and evaluation
system, and modern project management training programs for government project staff. The sixLOT TM OTe OMe Ie nena OeO RUE MN EIUEEIToEEAST ASIA |

refined to focus on improving project readiness for better
quality at entry, and streamlining government and ADB
procedures. ADB also strengthened the resident missions
to assume increased portfolio management responsibilities. Consequently, as of 31 December 2008, only one
project (1.5% of all projects under implementation) was
considered at risk (Table 17). Operational targets for project administration were fully met.

REGIONAL COOPERATION

As a key policy dialogue theme, regional cooperation was
incorporated into the PRC’s country partnership strategy
and will be prominent in Mongolia’s new strategy. ADB
accorded high priority to building cross-border infrastructure in both countries for better connectivity with Central
Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) members
and the Greater Mekong Subregion. To ease trade, ADB
played a critical role in developing the Joint Transport and
‘Trade Facilitation Action Plan and the Work Program for
Integrated Trade Facilitation and Customs Cooperation.
The CAREC Ministerial Conference recently endorsed
both and prioritized a list of short- to medium-term activities to support them. ADB also contributed to the CAREC
region’s considerable progress in simplification and harmonization of customs procedures and documentation, customs modernization and the use of information technology,

Partnership priorities. The country partnership strategy
for 2008-2010 was approved in April. It is closely aligned
with the government’s Eleventh Five-Year Plan (20062010) and Strategy 2020 priorities. The strategy aims to
promote inclusive and balanced development; resource
efficiency and environmental sustainability; regional cooperation, including regional public goods; and private
sector development. It also emphasizes diversifying ADB
operations in the PRC to reflect greater emphasis on the
harmonious development of rural and urban areas, energy
efficiency, and climate change. ADB will promote energy
efficiency in urban transport systems and energy-efficient
transport modes, and will encourage greater private sector
participation in infrastructure projects in partnership with
the public sector. ADB and the PRC’s strategic partnership will be built on promoting knowledge and innovation
as a crosscutting theme across all operations.

Impact of operations. To promote cleaner energy, ADB
continued to implement the Coal Mine Methane Development Project with a loan of $117.4 million approved in
2005. The project began coal-bed methane production inTABLE 15 East Asia: Assistance by Country, 2008

Helping Keep the People’s Republic of China Rolling

As the People’s Republic of China (PRC) expands
its rail network and adds high-speed trains, an
ADB loan is helping upgrade technology and
increase safety

 

Quanfu, a 36-year-old migrant worker from Henan

Province, is sitting on a pile of luggage. Each year
since 2005, he journeys to Beijing to work with a crew
maintaining the city’s parks and gardens. Now returning to his hometown on the midnight train, he is one
of millions throughout the PRC who depend on longdistance rail travel.

Over the past three decades, passenger volume on
the PRC’s railways has grown at an annual rate of 7%,
topping 1 billion passengers in 2007. Rail is also the
main mode of transport for freight, and traffic has been
rising by an average of 5% a year, exceeding 3 billion
tons in 2007.

The PRC's railways have the highest freight density in
the world and the second-highest passenger transport
volume after Japan. Their growth rates are putting great
pressure on capacity, making the reduction of bottlenecks
a key goal.

Rescue crew leader Wu Zhanlin says his base has carried out rescue
missions more efficiently since receiving a new large-tonnage
rescue crane

tural infrastructure improvement and empowered community members to reverse local land degradation. This has
strengthened the pipeline of ADB’s projects.

‘To improve living conditions in poverty-stricken,
geographically remote, and vulnerable minority regions,
ADB helped implement gender- and culturally sensitive programs in the country’s central and west regions.
An example is the $80 million urban development project

A review of three completed ADB railway projects
shows that gross regional domestic product (GRDP),
per capita GRDP, rural incomes, and average income
per farmer all increased because of improved access to
markets, new jobs, reduced costs of travel, and cheaper
goods. GRDP increased in the first 3-5 years by 10%-—
12% annually and by about 18% annually over 10 years,
after construction in these three railway project areas.

The government plans to extend and upgrade the
PRC's rail network—which covers more than 78,000
kilometers—as well as provide more high-speed trains.
Along with this rapid expansion, it seeks to increase
security and enhance safety. The safety issue is a
challenge, as trains crisscrossing the length and breadth
of the country encounter difficult operating conditions
amid varying geological features.

In 2007, ADB approved a $100 million loan to
help the government bring in modern technology for
responding quickly to emergencies, provide capacity
building for handling emergencies more efficiently,
and develop an institutional framework for an efficient
emergency rescue and restoration system.

As well as improving safety and reliability, the
system’s increased mobility and reduced downtime will
help achieve higher productivity and capacity.

“This project is ADB’s first stand-alone, sector-wide
intervention to enhance railway safety on a network
basis,” says Manmohan Parkash, an ADB principal
transport specialist. “The project will help improve the
emergency management system by providing a quick,
responsive rescue and restoration system.”

The PRC’s railways have the
highest freight density in the
world and the second-highest
passenger transport volume

Education, health, environment management, and urban
development were determined to be the priority sectors
for ADB assistance. Decline in debt stress and growth in
per capita income will improve the possibility of accessing ordinary capital resources (OCR) of ADB. Therefore, a
strategic shift in ADB operations, in line with these developments, will be reflected in the new country partnership
strategy, whichis scheduled formanagement consideration
by early 2010. It is expected to emphasize the creation of
an enabling environment for the private sector and the promotion of private investment. The possibility of Mongolia
borrowing both ADF and OCR will be considered.

Impact of operations. ADB spearheaded donor coordination efforts in the education sector based on the
government’s education sector master plan. In close collaboration with the Government of Japan, ADB helped
finalize this plan and further assisted Mongolia in submitting a request for funding to the Education for All Fast
Track Initiative, which resulted in a $8.9 million grant in
2008 anda total commitment of $29.4 million. In addition,
a memorandum of understanding was signed to improve
governance in the education sector, as a follow-up toa sector risk assessment.

Major investments in road transport and mining have
recently created a high-risk HIV/AIDS environment. As
part of ADB’s renewed commitment to the health sector, a $1.0 million advisory technical assistance project
was directed toward HIV-prevention services along major transport routes, mining sites, and cross-border areas.
The Cooperation Fund for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia
and the Pacific financed this initiative in partnership with
the Mongolian Employers’ Federation, private mining
companies, three ministries, and nongovernment organizations involved in education about HIV/AIDS.

Emergency Response to
Wenchuan Earthquake

An earthquake measuring 8.0 on the Richter scale—
the worst that the People’s Republic of China had witnessed in 30 years—struck Sichuan Province on 12 May
with its epicenter in Wenchuan County. The disaster
killed over 69,000 people and rendered millions homeless. Within 2 weeks of the earthquake, ADB extended
a $1 million technical assistance grant to fund essential
equipment and supplies for basic services, review the
disaster management framework for the earthquakeaffected area, and conduct a preliminary physical and
social infrastructure damage and needs assessment
for possible ADB support. The grant featured flexible
design and implementation arrangements for quick
response to the substantial uncertainties and risks associated with a major disaster. The procurement was
completed by 31 July, and the framework review and
preliminary assessment were completed by 30 November. The preliminary assessment then provided the basis for preparing lending support for physical and social
infrastructure rehabilitation in Sichuan and Shaanxi
provinces, two of the most damaged. A $400 million
emergency assistance project was processed for consideration of the Board of Directors.Annual Report 2008 53

of about 20,000, south of the Mongolian capital of
Ulaanbaatar. The clanging of the School of Humanity’s bell makes them sprint the last few meters to the
school’s door.

Cheeks ruddy from the cold, students welcome the
warmth of the building, but heat is precious during
Mongolian winters—and costly. Schools commonly
spend a third of their budget on heating alone, leaving
little money for paying teachers, buying textbooks, and
maintaining facilities.

The improved efficiency has freed resources for
inancing essential items, such as teachers’ salaries.
Today, Mongolia’s teachers are enthusiastic and can
expect to receive up to $250 per month. By comparison,
a doctor earns $300 a month, so the teachers’ salaries
put them well ahead of counterparts in the region's
other former socialist countries.

Schools are now more accessible for Mongolia’s
youth. Nyamdavaa Namjil, a 15-year-old student and
dormitory resident at the School of Humanity, wants to

Papua New Guinea

Partnership priorities. The midterm review of ADB’s
country strategy and program (2006-2010) confirmed
the rationale and validity of the four strategic priorities:
public financial management, private sector development, infrastructure, and health and HIV/AIDS.

Impact of operations. Ongoing ADB loans and technical assistance helped rehabilitate and maintain the Highlands
Highway network and improved road safety nationally.
‘The completed Rehabilitation of the Maritime Navigation Aids System Project eased distribution of goods and
services to rural areas through safer and faster maritime
transport, and enabled affordable, reliable, and safer sea
travel for coastal communities, thus helping develop local
markets and trade with mainstream commercial centers.

ADB strengthened support for private sector development, including through the preparation of a national
public-private partnership policy, approved by the cabinet. A broader program to reform state-owned enterprises
emerged and ADB produced a private sector assessment.
An innovative ADB-supported project continued to pilot
and demonstrate private sector participation in delivering rural health services, including HIV/AIDS prevention

In Palau, ADB developed a

supply and distribution of medical supplies. An ADB-supported project strengthened the successful NationWide
Microbank, which grew to eight branches.

Samoa

Partnership priorities. The country partnership strategy
for 2008-2012 focuses on private sector and infrastructure development to improve education, power, water,
and sanitation.

Impact of operations. A financing package supported the
Electric Power Corporation’s 8-year investment plan to
improve the reliability and security of power supply. The
Sanitation and Drainage Project mitigated floods in the
capital. The Education Sector Project II harmonized
donor activities in education, while the Small Business
Development Project provided small business loan guar
antees, microloans, and business training.

 

The ADB's $16.7 million Solomon Islands Road Improvement Project is building and rehabilitating roads and bridgesThrough the nonlending program, ADB helped
privatize the Samoa Broadcasting Corporation and Samoa Shipping Services, and helped strengthen corporate
governance of state-owned enterprises. ADB aided the
government’s drive to modernize the company registry,
introduce a framework for secured transactions, and pilottest ways to promote the productive and economic use of
customary land. ADB helped formulate and implement a
national development plan.

and Boost Catches

An ADB-supported project in Papua New
Guinea is improving night fishing and trade
by helping large and small vessels navigate
treacherous waters

again lighting the way across the vast waters surrounding Milne Bay Province, which include major
shipping lanes between Australasia and the rest of the
world, keeping them safe for seafarers. The lighthouses
are also a magnet for fishers eager to increase catches.
“Fish take the bait more at night and, with the
lighthouse to make sure | do not get lost, | catch two
or three times as many fish at night than by day,” says
Jack Henry, a fisher at East Cape on the easternmost
tip of mainland Papua New Guinea, as he squats in
darkness on his outrigger canoe safely within sight
of a lighthouse to beam him home. Night fishing has
boosted Henry's income by 400 to 500 kina ($160
and $200) a week.

A lighthouse on the China Strait helps ships save time and fuel

It is a fish story repeated among other far-flung
island communities, now crowned once more by
their guiding lights. Just off Samarai Island, a former
colonial seat of power and commerce because of its
strategic location in the China Strait, a beacon again
guides international and local vessels, thanks to the
Rehabilitation of the Maritime Navigation Aids System
Project. Supported by an ADB loan of $19.8 million, it is
a nationwide project to renovate 167 lighthouses fallen
into neglect through vandalism, theft, and disuse.

At Samarai’s bustling market, local ward councilor
Perry Dotaona says the lighthouses enable more
people to fish and travel at night with a resultant rise
in living standards. On nearby Logea Island, where
he lives, his neighbors now build solid homes of
concrete and corrugated iron to replace huts of sago
bark and leaves.

Often swept by storms, these dangerous waters
remain 90% uncharted, concealing reefs and shoals,
and the lighthouses help international and local mariners avoid catastrophe.

“When the lighthouses were not working, accidents
were common and many lives were lost,” says Andrew
Sarto, a wiry workboat skipper who has plied interisland routes for 35 years. “Some vessels would crash
onto reefs, others would get lost and blown off course.”
The number of reported marine accidents has fallen,
he says, since the lighthouses were fixed.

The Road to Empowerment

ADB is a partner in a novel project that is paving
the way to a brighter future for the women of
Timor-Leste

Leste, and in the lush green hills of the agriculturally

rich district of Maliana, about 140 kilometers (km)
west of the capital of Dili, a group of 11 villagers are
stripping overgrown vegetation from the shoulders of
a dirt road, clearing drains, and filling potholes. Some
of them, like Adelina de Araujo, are women. “We feel
we are doing something very important, helping our
villages get great access to the major roads and towns,”
she says.

Ms. de Araujo is one of 30 women doing basic road
maintenance under ADB's Road Sector Improvement
Project. The consultative and pro-women aspects of
this project, as well as the income-raising opportunities
it promotes, make it unique and likely a model for
future road rehabilitation and building.

The minister for infrastructure, Pedro Lay da Silva,
says his government wanted to partner with ADB on the

project because ADB is a leader in infrastructure in TimorLeste. Another partner, CARE Australia, implemented
the community empowerment initiative, an integral part
of the Road Sector Improvement Project, which began
in September 2005. Says CARE Australia’s assistant
country director (programs), Hana Mijovic, “We heard
that ADB was looking to partner with nongovernment
organizations to involve local communities in their road
improvement projects in Timor-Leste. We spoke to ADB
and both sides felt it would be a valuable partnership.”
The project is also committed to rehabilitating
123 km of road by resurfacing, stabilizing shoulders, and
improving drainage systems. Another innovation under
the project will be labor-intensive road maintenance on
a 47 km stretch.

Under the project, 44 people participate in the
community empowerment initiative, and more than
60% of these road workers are women. Paid $4 a day,
most are earning money for the first time in their lives.
CARE's deputy project manager, Luis Bere Buti, says,
“Most of the women we hired are widows. We gave
priority to female heads of households and to young
women in rural areas. We targeted them because they
represent groups that are usually left out of incomegenerating opportunities.” Ms. de Araujo buys food
and clothes with her earnings and pays for her siblings’
school fees. Fellow road worker Silvina de Jesus is happy
to be working and making money and would like to
see women all over Timor-Leste in road maintenance.
“A pay rise would be good too,” she laughs.

Tuvalu

Partnership priorities. A country partnership strategy for
‘Tuvalu was approved that emphasizes improved public expenditure and financial management. The strategy supports a set of fiscal performance benchmark indicators
agreed upon by the government, ADB, Australian Agency for
International Development (AusAID), and New Zealand’s
International Aid & Development Agency (NZAID).

Impact of operations. ADB continued to help upgrade the
‘Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute to double the number of seafarers trained per year. Seafarers’ remittances are
an extremely important source of income for many.

OVERVIEW

he South Asia Department led in mainstreaming the managing for development results
approach in its operations and building a
strong operational knowledge base in South Asia.
ADB’s nonsovereign approvals in the region
totaled $1.2 billion plus an estimated portion of
$25.0 million from the Equity Investment in Asian
Clean Energy Private Equity Funds, a regional project (Statistical Annex 10).

REGIONAL COOPERATION

Regional cooperation initiatives, including the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)
and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral
‘Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC),
received sustained support from ADB. As recommended in the SAARC Regional Multimodal Transport Study, model cross-border transport and transit
agreements were developed with ADB’s help. ADB

also provided technical assistance to support the
SAARC energy sector dialogue, the implementation of key resolutions of SAARC Summit, and
the activities of SAARC Secretariat. The second
BIMSTEC summit acknowledged the ADB-supported BIMSTEC Transport Infrastructure and
Logistics Study as an important first step in identifying connectivity bottlenecks and suggesting

The department’s regional program centered on preparing two flagship projects in transport and trade, and infrastructure for regional
tourism. ADB supported knowledge management activities such as networking among policy
research institutes and think tanks, particularly
in regional cooperation and integration. With the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), ADB did a study to quantify the benefits of economic cooperation in South
Asia. ADB carried out regional studies on trade in
services, key industries, and investment.

$11.7 million in technical assistance and $80.5 million in
multi country lending projects, was finalized in August.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

Major efforts in project administration and portfolio management paid dividends in 2008, as key portfolio indicators significantly improved. Disbursements reached
a record-breaking $2.4 billion, 25% better than in 2007.
Of this amount, project disbursements accounted for
$2.0 billion, 33% more than in 2007. Contract awards and
commitments were an unprecedented $2.4 billion, and
projects at risk dropped to an all-time low of 7% from 10%
in 2007 (‘Table 27).

COUNTRY HIGHLIGHTS

Bangladesh

Partnership priorities. In line with the country strategy and
program (2006-2010), reforms and investments in energy, transport, education, and urban infrastructure continued to receive ADB support. ADB increased assistance to
agriculture and rural infrastructure to raise agricultural
productivity and crop production, and strengthen food
security amid the global surge in food prices. Given the
country’s vulnerabilities, projects that included measures

for mitigating and adapting to climate change were de

Partnership priorities. Guided by the results-based country partnership strategy developed in close consultation
with the government and other development partners,
ADB continued to direct its lending at energy, roads, urban development, and financial and private sector development. ADB’s investment support, sector reform, and
capacity development operations in these core areas are
meant to sustain development impact with the help of
monitoring. On the nonlending side, technical support for
sector policy-making and executing agencies in improving their institutional, policy, and regulatory capacities

Impact of operations. Rural electrification remained a
priority. ADB supported Bhutan’s first power generation project with private sector participation. The Green
Power Development Project has both clean-power
trading and rural electrification components. Rural
electrification enabled poor households to establish
small-scale cottage industries; process food; practice
small trades more efficiently; and set up small shops,

Cleaning Up Kolkata

An innovative infrastructure project in India

18 and went through her first pregnancy without

eating properly, taking supplements, or seeing a
doctor. Her first baby arrived prematurely and underweight—and died less than 2 weeks later.

Standing in the doorway of her dark shanty in the
Kulia Tangra slum in east Kolkata, India, Das says she is
pregnant again. But this time she is getting advice from
a self-help group and is consulting a doctor.

“The group has taught me the importance of antitetanus shots and iron folic acid,” she says. “| have also
learned how to eat better.”

Das is benefiting from an innovative infrastructure
project in one of India’s most congested cities. With
more than $250 million in ADB loans, the Kolkata
Environmental Improvement Project is renovating
dilapidated sewerage and drainage systems and

mobilizing self-help groups in affected slums to address
social and environmental issues. Now Das’s household
not only has clean water and a modern sewerage
system but also access to community groups that can
help her family.

The upgraded facilities will serve around 1.5 million
people. Before the project, only about 0.2 million (17%
of the population in the project area) were connected
to a sewerage system and less than half of the area had
adequate drainage.

Kolkata’s environmental management capacity is
also growing. An associated capacity-building program, funded with a separate grant of $42 million from
the Department for International Development of the
United Kingdom, is improving the service delivery system of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and
communities’ access to basic services.

Under KMC’'s social development unit, several
nongovernment organizations (NGOs) are mobilizing
and advising self-help groups (sangha) of women
in nearly 100 slums. “Once you convince women to
meet, these groups multiply,” says Bipasha Keshri, a
coordinator for CIN] ASHA, an NGO that works in the
slums.

Many self-help groups now exist in Kolkata, and
not just in Das’s neighborhood. The goal is that they
will continue on their own after the project. The hope
is that other slums will adopt the self-help approach,
inspired by their success.

With more than $250 million

and restaurants. As more people used electric lights and
stoves rather than kerosene lamps and cooking fires,
their health improved.

ADB’s road sector interventions allowed farmers to bring
their produce to market, among other benefits. Banking efficiency improved; regulation was strengthened; and micro,
small, and medium-sized enterprises received targeted assistance. ADB started to help transform the credit information
unit into a full-fledged bureau to provide transparent and re-liable credit information and thus help mitigate risk, lower
the transaction costs of financial institutions, and increase
overall efficiency in the finance sector.

India

Partnership priorities. The preparation of the country partnership strategy (2009-2012) was substantially completed. With the aim of helping the government reduce
poverty and achieve inclusive growth as emphasized in its
Eleventh Five-Year Plan, the strategy rests on four strategic pillars: inclusive and environmentally sustainable
growth, investment catalysis through innovative business
and financing modalities, stronger results orientation
in project design and implementation and emphasis on
knowledge solutions, and regional cooperation.

ADB’s lending assistance through its multitranche
financing facility totaled $2.2 billion in 2006-2008.
Regular loan approvals reached $1.8 billion in 2008.
ADB approved new financing of $1.0 billion ($140.0 million in complementary financing and equity of $18.6
million) under its private sector window. This amount
covered direct loans, equity investments, cofinancing for wind and ultra-mega power generation projects,
rural telecommunications infrastructure development,
toll road expansion with private sector participation, and
development of residential mortgage guarantees. ADB
approved a $225.0 million nonsovereign loan to the Rural
Electrification Corporation of India to strengthen the rural transmission network.

Impact of operations. Overall portfolio performance has
improved significantly in recent years. Contract awards
rose from $550.5 million in 2004 to $1.2 billion in 2008,
and loan disbursements from $381.0 million to $1.5 billion
over the same period. Tripartite portfolio review meetings have now moved beyond tracking inputs to tracking outputs. The Madhya Pradesh State Roads Sector
Development Program, the Tsunami Emergency Assistance (Sector) Project, and the recently approved Orissa
Integrated Irrigated Agriculture and Water Management
Investment Program, among others, had good development impact. The Madhya Pradesh program helped
establish the Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporationas the state highway authority, develop computerized financial management and accounting systems,

and build capacity to develop and maintain roads in partnership with the private sector. The tsunami assistance
project helped rebuild safer houses, roads, bridges, and
other public infrastructure in Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
As part of the Orissa program, tenure reforms were made
in the legal framework of water users’ associations, and
higher representation of women was advocated, for more
sustainable institutions.

Maldives

Partnership priorities. ‘To help achieve national goals and
overcome institutional and resource constraints, ADB
and the government agreed on the two-phase assistance
strategy outlined in the country partnership strategy. In
phase 1, ADB would help build capacity in economic management and structure partnerships between the public
and private sectors in the three phase-2 sectors of transport, power, and private sector development. ADB also
approved a $12.0 million private sector operation for the
Housing Development Finance Corporation and a technical assistance loan of $7.5 million for micro, small, and
medium-sized enterprise development.

Impact of operations. The main commercial harbor, Malé
North Harbor, improved access to markets and social services for the 70% of the population living on the outer
atolls, where poverty is most intense. The Private Sector Development Project continued to develop micro,
small, and medium-sized enterprises to encourage inclusive growth that is broad-based, private sector—led, and
sustainable.

As a main development partner, ADB continued to
help the government formulate development plans and
set development priorities. Limited institutional capacity, however, has drawn out implementation and diluted
some intended benefits. The country partnership strategy therefore emphasizes capacity development to sustain
the development impact of projects.

“No one ever thought that people like me could buy a
house,” says Sherpa, who paid for his with earnings from
a job in road construction. “People now look up to me
and | feel really good.”

Sherpa’s work is part of the Decentralized Rural Infrastructure and Livelihood Project, which ADB has funded
since September 2004.

The $40 million project helps communities in 18
conflict-affected districts, in support of Nepal’s ongoing
peace process. Rural infrastructure is being developed,
livelihoods restored, jobs created, and excluded communities empowered to participate in development.

Nearly 150,000 unskilled local laborers are now building 91 kilometers of district roads and 54 trail bridges.

Nepal

Partnership priorities. The comprehensive midterm review of the country strategy and program (2005-2009),
completed in consultation with stakeholders in July,
validated its strategic pillars—broad-based economic
growth, inclusive social development, and good governance—while stressing the importance of state build
ing, inclusive growth, and results orientation.

 

People in the project areas with little or no previous income now earn about NRs300 (about $4) a day as members of building groups, the vast majority of them poor
women and the disadvantaged.

“In the 6 months since | started working, | have saved
NRs22,000 (about $290),” says Panchamaya B.K., a widow
who is raising two children. “With this money and some contribution from my parents, | have bought a piece of land.”

The project has raised awareness among women in
the building groups, giving them the confidence to actively participate in community development and thus gain
social status, leadership roles, and autonomy. Better cash
incomes have increased their self-esteem and widened
recognition of women’s contributions to the improved
livelihoods of poor households.

Intensive social mobilization under the project has embedded the practice of participation in rural communities,
changed cultural attitudes that used to inhibit development, and included and empowered formerly excluded
and vulnerable groups. With all communities in conflictaffected areas represented, the project was able to operate even during the conflict period. The project has helped
create social capital, and thereby smooth transition to the
present post-conflict environment.

Encouraged by the progress made under the project,
ADB used a similar participatory approach to expand rural
infrastructure investment in 20 other districts under the Rural Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Sector Development
Program, which began implementation in 2007.

The project has raised
awareness among women
members of the building groups
and given them the confidence
and leadership to participate in
community development

Consultations with a broad range of stakeholders
were also held in partnership with the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom and the
World Bank to prepare for anew country partnership strategy to be completed in 2009. The annual country portfolio review with the government and key development
partners in November was intended to strengthen country systems by identifying generic implementation issues

and establishing results-based monitoring mechanismsand a time-bound action plan for dealing with implementation constraints.

Impact of operations. The ongoing Education Sector Program I contributed significantly to educational development. In the first year of implementation, the net
enrollment ratio in primary education increased from
87% to 89%. The percentage of children in grade 1 with
early childhood development experience increased from
18% to 33%; the grade-5 survival rate, from 80% to 81%;
and the gender parity index for the net enrollment ratio,
from 0.94 to 0.96. The percentage of trained teachers improved as well.

The ongoing Road Network Development Project
opened up 62 kilometers (km) of new track roads to remote district headquarters, and upgraded 121 km of feeder
and district roads and 342 km of the East-West Highway.
‘The rural population now has better access to basic social

services and wider economic opportunities.
Sri Lanka

Partnership priorities. The country partnership strategy
(2009-2011), formulated in close consultation with the
government and reflecting its priorities, was approved by
ADB in October. Road, power, and water supply projects
were in the pipeline. A fiscal management program and a
standby project in education—areas supported earlier by
ADB—were also planned.

Annual Report 2008 73

ADB approved two projects. The $90 million Southern Transport Development Project (supplementary financing, from ordinary capital resources) will complete
the construction of an expressway between the south and

Jolombo. The $83 million Dry Zone Urban Water and
Sanitation Project, funded entirely from the Asian Development Fund, will pipe water to four towns—two in the
conflict-affected Northern Province and two in the North
Western Province.

Impact of operations. ADB continued to help modernize
secondary education by developing computer laboratories,
training teachers, developing curricula, and introducing
school-based assessment and management systems. With
the help of the distance education network developed under the Distance Education Modernization Project, students in less-developed districts, including two eastern
districts, acquired remote access to study materials through
a central hub in Colombo and could complete entrance examinations from their districts.

ADB also tackled physical, institutional, and policy
constraints in transport, with its contribution over the last
two decades “substantial” by a recent country assistance
program evaluation. Four projects rehabilitated and upgraded 1,265 km of national roads, leading to expected efficiency gains and cost savings. Traffic on the completed
roads was adequate and grew in step with the economy.
Vehicle operating costs and travel times were reduced and

transport services improved.

REGIONAL COOPERATION

ADB strengthened cooperation within archipelagic Southeast Asia (aSEA), which includes the Brunei Darussalam—
Indonesia—Malaysia— Philippines East ASEAN Growth
Area (BIMP-EAGA), the Indonesia—Malaysia—Thailand
Growth Triangle (IMT-GT), and the Greater Mekong
Subregion (GMS). It also further improved coordination with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) secretariat.

ADB supported the Third GMS Summit in Vientiane,
Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), in March;
the First GMS Economic Corridors Forum in Kunming,
Yunnan Province, People’s Republic of China, in June; and
the completion of the GMS regional cooperation operations
business plan for 2009—2011. This plan has 39 proposed subregional investment projects amounting to around $1.9 billion and nonlending products and services totaling almost
$23.0 million.

ADB intensified its assistance to subregional institutions within BIMP-EAGA and to helping the private
sector communicate with development partners. Studies
for streamlined customs, immigration, quarantine, and
security procedures and harmonized border-crossing
formalities were completed, along with a comprehensive midterm review of the BIMP-EAGA road map for
2006-2010.

ADB worked closely with the three IMT—GT countries to implement the IMT—GT road map for 2007—
2011. ADB supported IMT—GT connectivity corridor development through studies on logistical costs and
constraints on maritime link development. ADB also assisted the Center for IMT'—GT Subregional Cooperation.

private investments in energy.

Impact of operations. ADB continued supporting the implementation of an integrated ticketing system for the
Bangkok mass rapid transit network. Three major technical assistance projects were completed. The first helped
the government prepare a strategic development plan for
southern Thailand. The second one provided assistance
for implementing the capital market development master plan. The third project was designed to strengthen

Thailand as a regional development partner.

Viet Nam

Partnership priorities. Fully aligned with Viet Nam’s FiveYear Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006-2010, the
country strategy and program for 2007-2010 expanded
ADB operations through support to pro-poor, business-led
economic growth; social inclusiveness; and environmental
protection and management. Governance and regional coop
eration were also key priorities. ADB helped increase private

 

sector investment and employment through assistance to
develop physical infrastructure; improve the business environment (encompassing reforms in regulation, state-owned
enterprises, and governance); strengthen market institutions; and develop human resources. Regional cooperation
through the GMS Program was promoted to develop crossborder trade and new economic opportunities in otherwise
isolated border areas, and tackle cross-border concerns such
as communicable diseases and adverse development impacts. In the face of rising inflation and current account
deficit, ADB also provided reliable macroeconomic policy
advice.

private sector. Beyond providing money, ADB assists host countries and
private companies by creating a conducive investment climate, mitigating
risks, facilitating regulatory dialogue, and providing technical expertise.he adoption of Strategy 2020 is a milestone for
nonsovereign operations. As ADB’s paramount
strategic document that covers 2008-2020, it defines the directions and framework for the planning and
financing of ADB’s operations, organization, and business processes. It prioritizes private sector development
as a key driver of change in ADB’s operations. By 2020,
50% of ADB’s lending operations will be in private sector
development and operations.

Kabul’s best-known bakery has also benefited from
AIB. The family firm is famous citywide for its cakes and
cookies. The 30-year old business borrowed $40,000 to
open a new store in Khair Khana, an upmarket suburb

project and thus encourages local and international commercial banks to participate). Entities seeking assistance
from ADB for a private sector project benefit not only from
financial assistance but also from the expertise and guidance of the ADB team. PSOD’s operations focus principally
on the finance and infrastructure sectors.

As in the previous year, the focus of ADB’s nonsovereign operations was on core priority sectors aligned with

equity investments, $10.0 million in political risk guarantees, and $565.0 million in B-loans. Fourteen projects
focused on infrastructure, capital markets, and finance sectors. In line with Strategy 2020, seven of these projects (representing 62% of the approved amount) concentrated on
energy, five of which relate to renewable and clean energy.
Four projects, representing 16%, were in the finance sector,
while two were in telecommunications (10%), one in transport (10%), and one in health (2%). Credit enhancement
products—such as guarantees and B-loans—supplemented
direct loan financing and equity investments. The average
size of projects increased from $44.0 million for 9 projects in
2000 to $150.0 million for 15 projects in 2008.

ADB targets projects with significant development
impact and focuses on initiatives that stimulate the private sector and lead to accelerated, sustainable, and inclusive growth. One example is the financing of Roshan,
the leading mobile telecommunications services provider in Afghanistan. ADB’s first financing to Roshan was in
2004, soon after start-up. After its enormous business and
development success, ADB supported Roshan’s expansion
with new debt and guarantee facilities in 2006 and 2008.
The most recent assistance is a $60 million loan to help
Roshan reach even more remote communities, introduce
the first mobile banking facility in Afghanistan and the
entire region, and make its operations more environmentfriendly by installing solar power generation at many of its
telecommunications towers. Roshan also undertakes important charitable operations through telemedicine, soup
kitchens, and education for street children. The most recent Roshan financing took only 4 months from client
approach to first disbursement, showing how market-responsive ADB can be with an equally responsive client.

A Breath of Fresh Air in India

An ADB-supported Petronet expansion project
in Gujarat state is providing households and
industry with cleaner, cheaper fuel

buses and auto-rickshaws but, unlike some other
Indian cities, the air is breathable.

Vishinath Jagtap is a big part of the reason why. The
auto-rickshaw driver has switched from a petrol-run threewheeler to a compressed natural gas (CNG)-powered
one. He has doubled his earnings: not only is CNG cheaper
than petrol but many passengers also prefer less-polluting
vehicles.

Narendra Rana also plays a part. He is the manager of
a privately owned fleet of nearly 100 CNG-powered buses
that ferry passengers to and from downtown. The buses
cost 15% more than those that run on diesel, he says, but
they are cheaper to fuel, need less maintenance, and cause
less air and noise pollution.

T« downtown streets of Vadodara pulsate with

 

Like 70% of auto-rickshaw drivers in Vadodara, India, Vishinath
Jagtap has doubled his income since switching to compressed

facturing areas and will be India’s first toll road financed
on a design—build—finance-operate structure basis. The
project also employs a revenue-sharing model with the National Highways Authority of India—a first for an Indian
road project. This model allows resources to be leveraged,
allocates risks efficiently, and potentially controls project development time and costs. If successful, the project
could be a model for other public-private partnerships.

Around the city, factories are switching to cleaner
natural gas, and households are making the change
as well, giving up the more expensive and polluting
kerosene.

The transformation to a cleaner fuel source is
driven by government policy as India switches from
oil and coal to natural gas to meet energy needs that
grew at a yearly average of 4.5% over the past decade.
Natural gas contributes only 8% to the country’s energy
requirement, compared with nearly 90% by oil and coal.
The government wants to lift the share of natural gas to
15% by 2012 and 20% by 2025.

To support this effort, in April 2004, the country’s
first liquefied natural gas (LNG) import and regasification
terminal at Dahej started operations. The project, owned
by Petronet LNG Limited and supported by equity and
debt financing by ADB, imports LNG, mostly from Qatar,
converts it back to gas, and sells the gas to industry and
household consumers.

Vadodara uses more gas than most other cities in
India because of its proximity to gas pipelines and to
Petronet’s terminal at Dahej, 150 kilometers away on
the coast.

Since Delhi, Mumbai, and Vadodara were chosen to
pilot-test CNG vehicles, the number of gas-fueled vehicles
has soared. Today, an estimated 70% of Vadodara’s
three-wheelers and all its inner-city buses run on CNG.

As other urban centers and industries increasingly
follow Vadodara’s example, natural gas will continue
to displace oil-based fuels to the benefit of industry,
agriculture, and transport. And it will give people in the
participating cities a breath of fresh air.

Today, an estimated 70% of
Vadodara’s three-wheelers
and all its inner-city buses run

A final example of ADB’s role in structuring and executing new transactions in the market was the call for proposals for clean energy funds—the first of its kind in the
Asian market. In a process that spanned several months,
ADB solicited proposals from fund managers to establish
clean energy private equity funds. Then, through a competitive process, 5 funds from the 19 submissions were
selected to receive funding of up to $20 million each, or

SNOILVaSdO NOISYJAOSNON |NONSOVEREIGN OPERATIONS |

$100 million in total. This effort successfully catalyzed interest from new funds and has helped the industry evolve
toward higher-caliber, more experienced fund managers.

ADB responds on an ongoing basis to the shifts in
the role required from the private sector in developing
member countries. In the People’s Republic of China, as
financing for traditional power generation became more
widely available, PSOD focused its efforts on financing
renewable energy generation and energy-efficiency initiatives.

cities of Gujarat, India. It is taking the lead in developing public-private partnership projects that are equitable
and sustainable in severely underserved sectors. ADB is
providing assistance in initial project development, which
includes identification and selection of suitable projects,
development of a concession structure, establishment of
a bidding process, and project marketing. This will enable successful private sector participation in an open and
transparent manner. ADB may separately support successful bids through equity, loans, and/or guarantees.

ADB’s policy is to fund no more than 25% of the total cost
ofany one project directly. However, in rare circumstances
where small transactions are accepted for their high development impact, it will directly support a higher percent
 

“Petronet represents a classic example of a public-private partnership that operates as commercially as a private sector entity with an independent board”—Shantanu Chakraborty, ADB senior investment specialistage of the overall financing. It is therefore important that
PSOD build a close and collaborative relationship with
the finance community, which is enhanced by ADB’s various guarantee and cofinancing products. The demand for
these products has increased substantially, particularly
given recent finance market turmoil.

ADB helped mobilize cofinancing from partners
(using ADB’s
$565.0 million of direct new money for developing mem
cofinancing instruments), catalyzing

ber countries, which went to three projects with an aggre
gate cost of $2.7 billion.

AND SHARING
KNOWLEDGE

Under Strategy 2020, knowledge management is one of five key
drivers of change that allow ADB to stimulate growth, synergize
broader development assistance, and become a more active and better
development partner. ADB launched a number of new initiatives that
underscore the importance of knowledge management and learning.ENHANCING KNOWLEDGE
MANAGEMENT UNDER
STRATEGY 2020

n light of its mandate to advance ADB’s knowledge

agenda both internally and externally, the Regional and

Sustainable Development Department (RSDD) reviewed Knowledge Management in ADB (www.adb.org/
documents/policies/knowledge-management/knowledgemanagement.pdf). While the review found ADB’s knowledge management framework to be farsighted and sound,
itarticulated a plan of action for upgrading knowledge management to meet the requirements of Strategy 2020.

‘The review concluded that knowledge generated by
ADB and other entities must be closely linked and embedded in ADB operations. Therefore, ADB resolved that the
‘Technical Assistance Strategic Forum would emphasize improving coordination between its knowledge and operations
departments, and that this would be done based on five key
areas for ADB’s research activities for 2009-2011. Ona pilot
basis, each of ADB’s regional departments would formulate
country partnership strategies that analyze developing member country knowledge requirements. Preparation of these
strategies was to involve ADB’s knowledge departments,
regional knowledge hubs, communities of practice, and informal networks hosted by ADB. Likewise, on a pilot basis,
operational papers—such as reports and recommendations
of the President and technical assistance reports—were
henceforth to analyze the knowledge products reviewed.

‘The review recommended that ADB’s communities of
practice and informal networks become integral to ADB’s
business processes; that the budget of the communities of
practices be increased based on a clear set of objectives and
terms of reference for each; that a new agriculture, rural development, and food security community of practice be created by upgrading the existing informal network that tackles
these issues; and that the communities of practice engage in
external partnerships wherever possible.

ADB decided early on to encourage research and networking on innovative knowledge products and services, and this led to the establishment of seven regional
knowledge hubs. The Asian Development Bank Institute
(ADBI), Economics and Research Department (ERD),
Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI), and
RSDD have created knowledge, engaged in knowledge net

working, and informed external audiences. Several regional
departments have likewise initiated strategic and policy research partnerships with institutes both within and outside
the region. (Appendix 14 lists the selected knowledge products of the knowledge and regional departments.)

RSDD reviewed the regional knowledge hubs and recommended that their forms and functions should be better defined within the context of ADB operations. The
review reasoned that the working relationships between
the knowledge hubs and ADB should be operationally
defined. This would require that ADB develop criteria to select knowledge hubs and ensure that expected outputs and
outcomes are specified during the selection process. The
review concluded that resident missions should be actively
involved in selecting and partnering with knowledge hubs
wherever possible, and that nonregional institutions from
ADB member countries should be identified as potential
knowledge hubs in accordance with ADB’s sector and thematic priorities. Agreements with all knowledge hubs should
require dissemination of information within ADB and its
developing member countries.

Numerous initiatives were launched to ensure that ADB
staff members fully understood the importance of knowledge products to ADB operations. For example, ADB’s induction program for new staff began to include briefings on
knowledge management and learning. Early steps to design
training programs in knowledge management and learning
were taken. The role that narrative and story might play
in ADB was tested. ADB introduced the Knowledge Solutions series (www.adb.org/knowledgesolutions) to popularize tools, methods, and approaches to drive development
and improve its effects. ADB also launched the Knowledge
Showcase series (www.adb.org/knowledgeshowcase), which
highlights innovative ideas from technical assistance initiatives and other knowledge products. This series has strong
potential for use in communities of practice. RSDD also
conceptualized the Forum on Learning to raise awareness
of the importance of knowledge management and learn

ing, advance knowledge generation and sharing, strengthen the link between knowledge and ADB operations, and
build and enhance skills relating to knowledge management. The knowledge departments also explored ways to
better disseminate ADB’s knowledge products in coordination with the Department of External Relations.

Knowledge management is not the sole responsibility
of any particular department or unit. However, the Knowledge Management Center facilitates and coordinates the
knowledge initiatives under ADB’s knowledge management framework. In 2008, the center formulated the plan
of action mentioned above.

INFORMING EXTERNAL
AUDIENCES

The Regional Economic Outlook

The global economy is facing a major downturn. Worsening financial problems have caused economic activity
to stall and the outlook for global growth to dim. With the
major industrial countries already in or near recession, the
global slowdown is expected to be deeper and much longer than previously anticipated. To meet the need for more
timely regional economic projections amid rapidly unfolding developments on the global economic front, ERD established the Regional Economic Outlook Task Force.
The task force produced a special note to Asian Development Outlook 2008 Update, Developing Asia’s Prospects in
the Global Slowdown (www.adb.org/Documents/Reports/
developing-Asia-growth-forecast/AEM-Report.pdf), which
revised gross domestic product (GDP) growth projections
downward for developing Asia in 2008 and 2009. The special

agencies, international financial
institutions, market participants,

note was released in tandem with the issue of Asia Economic
Monitor (aric.adb.org) on 11 December. This work was enriched by ADBI’s Managing Capital Flows project (http://
www.adbi.org/research.managing.capital.flows/) (p. 95).

Building Knowledge and Capacity for
Regional Economic Integration

OREI published a groundbreaking study, Emerging Asian
Regionalism: A Partnership for Shared Prosperity (aric.adb.
org/emergingasianregionalism/), which received substantial coverage from international and local media. The study
examined issues in trade and investment, money and finance, macroeconomic interdependence, and the forces shaping a new regional economic architecture. OREI
further addressed key developments in emerging East
Asia in Asia Economic Monitor, July and December 2008
(aric.adb.org), and in Asia Bond Monitor, April and
November 2008 (asianbondsonline.adb.org). It also issued
guidelines on how to design, negotiate, and implement a
free trade agreement in Asia (www.adb.org/documents/
manuals/fta).

Restructuring Beyond the Subprime—a conference
organized by OREI the week that Lehman Brothers filed
for bankruptcy—gave financial regulators, rating agencies,
international financial institutions, market participants,
and academic and research institutions an opportunity
to exchange points of view concerning the global financial crisis. OREI also organized a number of training programs and seminars. The seminars under the Asia-Pacific
(APEC)
tors Training Initiative aimed to encourage appropriate

Economic Cooperation Financial Regulaprudential standards, supervision, and regulation, and
build institutional capacity to support them. The initiative has trained about 2,300 participants in banking supervision and securities regulation. Two training
programs on regional economic and financial monitoring provided staff from ministries of finance and central
banks of selected Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) +3 countries with knowledge, practical tools,
and skills concerning the detection and prevention of
financial vulnerabilities, early warning systems, financial programming, monetary and exchange rate policy coordination, and regional integration systems. OREI
offered training courses to strengthen the managerial
and strategic skills of officials involved in designing, ne-gotiating, and implementing free trade agreements. This
was primarily achieved by providing participants with a
better understanding of economic, trade, legal, and institu
tional policy issues.

Researching Food Prices and Inflation
in Developing Asia

Food prices have increased sharply since mid-2007 and accelerated alarmingly in early 2008. Rice and wheat prices
spiked to levels not seen in more than three decades. Such
price rises worsen poverty in developing Asia by reducing
the real incomes of the already poor, and push many others below the poverty line. ERD investigated the impact
of elevated global commodity prices on developing Asia
in its special report, Hood Prices and Inflation in Developing
Asia: Is Poverty Reduction Coming to an End? (www.adb.org/
documents/reports/food-prices-inflation/). This report,
which was released at ADB’s annual meeting, proposed
policy responses to elevated food prices that would prevent
reversal of the region’s gains in poverty reduction. Because
this report was one of the first responses to the current
economic crisis, it was widely referenced by international
organizations, newspapers with global distribution, and
universities. Taking the analysis of commodity prices further, the Asian Development Outlook 2008 Update (www.adb.
org/documents/books/ado/2008/update/) examined the
causes of the recent food and oil price rises, their likely future direction, and their expected macroeconomic
impacts on the price of globally traded commodities. The
update received significant coverage in the global media,
thus continuing ERD’s efforts to influence policy making
by creating and disseminating knowledge.

Purchasing Power Parities
for Poverty Measurement

‘The demand for internationally comparable estimates
of poverty, such as the widely known $1-a-day poverty
counts, is considerable among policy analysts, researchers, and donor agencies. Key to generating internationally
comparable poverty estimates are purchasing power parities (PPPs)—conversion factors that ensure that different
currencies have a common purchasing power over a given
set of goods and services. Experts have debated for some
time that the particular set of PPPs used since 1990 for

Annual Report 2008 93

international comparisons of poverty may have deficiencies. ADB examined the sensitivity of poverty estimates
to different approaches to PPP construction using data
from 16 countries. In addition to more conventional PPPs,
the study generated poverty-specific PPPs based on comparisons of the prices of goods and services purchased by
the poor across the 16 countries. The conclusion was that
the approach to generating PPPs matters a great deal. For
example, the difference between the number of poor estimated on the basis of poverty-specific PPPs and the socalled consumption PPPs that have traditionally been
used to estimate poverty can be higher than 20% in some
cases. ADB therefore recommended that the next round
of the International Comparisons Project—the global statistical project that generates PPPs—tentatively scheduled for 2011, collect information on the prices of goods
and services the poor pay and compile poverty-specific
PPPs. ADB’s 2008 Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific
(www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Key_Indicators/2008/)
contains a chapter describing ADB’s study.

The Impact of the Global Financial
Crisis on Asia

The global economy now faces a deep and prolonged recession triggered by the financial crisis in the United States
(US). US Financial Crisis, Global Financial Turmoil, and
Developing Asia: Is the Era of High Growth at an End?
(www.adb.org/Documents/Working-Papers/2008/EconomicsWP139.pdf) examined the roots of the global financial
crisis and its spread from the US to the rest of the world.
The paper concludes that economic growth in developing
Asia in 2008 and 2009 should be expected to deteriorate seriously, as the rapid growth the region’s export-oriented
economies have enjoyed has largely been fueled by external demand. The paper argues that if developing Asia is to

mitigate the impact of financial contagion, sharp contraction in demand in global markets, and slowing growth in
world trade, it must restore confidence in markets and
reorient growth toward domestic demand through judicious use of monetary and fiscal policies. The paper sees
reorienting Asia’s growth toward consumption-led domestic demand, infrastructure investment, and improved
health and social security programs as being critical to cushion the impact of the current recession in the industrialized
economies. The paper’s emphasis on reorienting growth in
developing Asia sets the tone of the 2009 Asian Development
Outlook.

ADBI’s conferences on The Global Financial Turmoil and its Impact on Asia, jointly organized with the
Japan Resident Office, and Asia’s Response to the Global
Financial Crisis were other quick reactions to the crisis.
ADBI’s annual conference on Asia’s Contribution to Global Economic Development and Stability also focused on
the global financial crisis, food and commodity prices, and
Asia’s pivotal role in an open, transparent trading system.

KNOWLEDGE NETWORKING

Knowledge networking is a dynamic process by which
knowledge is shared, developed, and evolved. ADB’s support for knowledge networking with clients and partners
continued to evolve and expand. Whereas the first generation of knowledge hubs was established in directagreement

 

ADB’s kHub

Knowledge networking is an effective way of combining individuals’ knowledge and skills in the pursuit of
personal and organizational objectives. To encourage
knowledge networking, ADB's library was transformed
into a knowledge hub (kHub). The kHub hosts book
launches and activities of communities of practice,
and provides kinesthetic informational resources such
as a touch screen that allows staff members to show
project locations. In addition to its self-service information resources, the kHub provides timely information support to ADB staff engaged in project design
and development. Demand for the kHub’s services is
driven by the human need for connectivity, collaboration, and storytelling. The kHub created new staff
positions to align its operations with the information
requirements of Strategy 2020.

with ADB as their client and main beneficiary, subsequent
efforts have seen ADB support the establishment of knowledge hubs under the auspices of regional cooperation networks such as the Asia—Pacific Water Forum. Collaboration
resulted in the formulation of key operating principles for
knowledge hubs as part of the region’s knowledge network
ing infrastructure.
Knowledge Networking and HIV/AIDs

Most Asian countries face the potential for HIV and AIDS
epidemics. The AIDS Commission’s March report for Asia
reaffirmed that the region would have both the opportunity and the means to stop HIV and AIDS if resources were
to be targeted at the most at-risk populations. Regardless
of how well-designed national HIV and AIDS programs are,
however, if they are to be successful they must be based
on accurate data and sound analyses, and must incorporate
the experience of other countries. The HIV and AIDS Data Hub for Asia-Pacific (www.aidsdatahub.org), which is a
joint project of ADB, the Joint United Nations Programme
on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), made Asian data and analyses of
various aspects of HIV and AIDS available on one website.
This valuable information—which includes national plans,
surveillance reports, population-based surveys, special
studies, and epidemiological fact sheets, as well as identified gaps in data collection—can be used by stakeholders,
including policy makers, researchers, and donors, in their
efforts to deal with the negative impact of HIV and AIDs
on developing countries in Asia and the Pacific.

Building Knowledge for Sustainable
Development

Highlights of ADBI’s work were conferences on the evolving financial and economic crisis, managing capital flows,
and infrastructure and regional cooperation. The financial
and economic crisis conferences examined the unfolding
global financial and economic crisis originating from the
US subprime crisis. They suggested national and regional responses to make Asian economies resilient to global
shocks and reinforce existing regional cooperation mechanisms. The series of gatherings under the second discussed the extent of capital account liberalization in the
region and analyzed regional cooperation options to mini-Capacity building and training

mize the negative impacts of expanding capital inflows
into Asia. Country reports were discussed at a follow-up
workshop on financial instability in Viet Nam and neighboring countries.

ADBI helped prepare a position paper by Asian think
tanks for the forthcoming Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), ASEAN+3, and East Asia summits

 

Knowledge-Enriched ADB
Operations in East Asia

ADB's knowledge products and services were
planned in close consultation with local partners to
meet demand and enrich other loan and technical
assistance projects and capacity-building activities.
A full range of client-driven awareness-raising and
multimedia materials, journal articles, policy notes,
reports, sector and thematic papers, technical notes,
and training and instructive materials was produced
(Appendix 14). In the People’s Republic of China, the
knowledge products covered issues such as transition
rom disaster response to recovery; inclusive growth
‘oward a harmonious society; climate change, energy security, and worker safety; and promotion of
environmentally sustainable transport. Other knowledge products helped shape policy on rising food
prices, rural safety net and development-based
poverty reduction programs, earthquake insurance,
post-disaster rehabilitation and reconstruction, and
impact of nonsovereign lending. In Mongolia, beter use of research and evidence shed light on risk
assessment and risk management plans in education
and infrastructure and how successful financial reorms eased the transition to a market economy. In
both countries, the objective was to distill powerful
policy messages from research; use networks, hubs,
and partnerships and embed knowledge in operaions; and develop and maintain long-term knowledge programs.

that are to identify swift and effective responses to the
crisis. Joint ADB and ADBI work on infrastructure and regional cooperation progressed, with five conferences inviting critical feedback on the flagship book, /nfrastructure for
Seamless Asia. ‘The ASEAN Surveillance Report (August)
used the capital inflow issues papers from the Managing Capital Flows project. The paper on managing capital
flows in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and other
country papers were used as input toa PRC Resident Mission’s policy note to PRC policy makers. Other research
that generated good feedback was the Contract Farming
and Market Facilitation for the Rural Poor project.

ADBI’s distinguished-speaker series encourages debate and knowledge sharing. Thirteen presentations were
held at which internationally known economists, including one Nobel Prize winner, spoke on policy and development issues in the region, including global governance
reform, global imbalances, and integration strategies for
ASEAN.

Over 1,000 participants, about 70% of whom were officials from ADB’s developing member countries, attended
21 ADBI courses and workshops to improve management
capacity. About 45% of participants held senior positions.
Capacity building and training to support private sector development focused on public-private partnerships in infrastructure investment and development, with five workshops
conducted for more than 350 government officials. Eight
workshops were held to aid regional cooperation and integration initiatives to promote trade. Five workshops advanced
better governance and improved government policies and
their implementation, covering areas such as competition
policies, tax administration, and media reporting.

The Developing Asia Journalism Awards program attracted 240 entries from journalists in developing member
countries. To enhance the capacity of the media in monitoring the performance of governments and their policies,
and encouraging public debate on these issues, the program
included, for the first time, a workshop that introduced 22
participating journalists to emerging economic and development issues and deepened their understanding of them.

JRO’s move to ADBI’s location smoothed communication and cooperation with ADB headquarters and
strengthened internal networking. During this productive year, ADBI held 57 conferences, seminars, and workshops, and published 9 books and about 50 research papers
and disseminated them to policy makers.

OED conducted a special evaluation study of the previous long-term strategic framework. The study, which the
Development Effectiveness Committee discussed on
6 February, provided crucial inputs into the preparation
of Strategy 2020. Similarly, special evaluation studies
on the seventh and eighth replenishments of the Asian
Development Fund (ADF) were vital to informing the
ninth replenishment (ADF X) meetings. A series of other evaluation studies, which assessed the performance
of ADB assistance and identified actions to improve operations in Strategy 2020’s priority areas, was also completed.

OED performed several other high-level evaluations
relating to private sector development, finance, regional
cooperation, and education. It completed two special
evaluation studies on ADB operations in support of private
equity funds and domestic capital market development,
and one evaluation update on ADB assistance to financial
intermediation for the private sector, with special reference to small and medium-sized enterprises. The regional
cooperation assistance program evaluation of the Greater
Mekong Subregion was also completed, drawing on seven
sector- or thematic-level evaluations.

In addition to preparing formal evaluation reports, OED
provided feedback to operations departments by hosting seminars on selected evaluations; maintaining the
Evaluation Information System (a searchable database
of evaluation lessons, recommendations, and management responses [evis.adb.org]); commenting on draft operations documents; and participating in management
review meetings. OED commented on about 500 operations, policy, and strategy documents.

OED actively promoted and disseminated its knowledge products and services. It held a number of seminars
for the purpose of receiving feedback on major evaluation reports. In addition to issuing Learning Curves and
Evaluation Alerts, OED also introduced Evaluation Presentations (brief presentations relating to evaluation topics) and
Evaluation News, which reports on monitoring and evaluation-related events.

of seven as his neighbors. Much of the profit from their
crops was eaten up by the costs of the long journey
over potholed and frequently washed-out roads to rice
markets, which also made it prohibitively expensive to
bring in badly needed farm machinery and fertilizers to
improve yield.

That was before the East-West Corridor Road Project
passed by their farms, linking Thailand and Viet Nam
across the Lao PDR. A flagship initiative of the Greater
Mekong Subregion (GMS) program, the road project
received substantial assistance from ADB. The GMS
program has received an aggregate funding of $3.3 billion from ADB for improving the transport infrastructure
in five GMS countries. Today, Khamkong and his fellow
rice farmers bring their rice to market themselves on the

ALIGNING EVALUATION
WITH STRATEGY 2020

To align its operations with Strategy 2020, OED modified both its internal organization and its evaluation
and knowledge dissemination activities to make them
consistent with Strategy 2020’s strategic agendas, driv
 

new road, securing the best possible price, and their
paddies are now tilled with modern machinery and
improved with much-needed fertilizers.

Using the criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability, ADB’s Operations Evaluation
Department rated the project “successful.” The project improved road transport efficiency in the Lao PDR
and Viet Nam in three ways: reducing vehicle operating costs, reducing travel time, and increasing vehicle
speeds (www.adb.org/Documents/Reports/SAPE/REG/
SAP-REG-2008-86/SAP-REG-2008-86. pdf).

The project has been less effective, however, in
enabling cross-border movement. Cross-border trade
has been constrained since the cross-border transport
agreement has not been fully implemented.

Along with the positive developments, some negative impacts have come to light. Road improvement has
brought an attendant deterioration in road safety. For
example, the Lao PDR’s local transport department in
Champasack Province estimated the number of accidents
has increased by 71% since project completion in 2001.
Resettlement issues have emerged in Cambodia owing
to widening of the Phnom Penh-Ho Chi Minh City road.
There has also been a perceptible rise in the spread of
HIV/AIDS and an emergence of issues relating to labor
movement and migration. Outside of strengthening the
capacity of the affected countries to tackle these concerns,
ADB needs to continue generating multilateral and multiorganization efforts to mitigate such problems.

effectiveness, efficiency,

and sustainability, ADB’s

3-year implementation period. A staff engagement survey
was conducted in March by external experts with the goal
of promoting positive organizational change. With more
than 80% of staff participating, the results identified categories perceived favorably, such as ADB’s goals and objectives, work environment, job satisfaction, and working
relationships. The results also identified a number of key
priority areas for ADB to focus on to raise the level of staff
engagement, such as the reward system, career development, performance management, and communication.
ADB took interim follow-up actions for a number of these
key priority areas, including salaries and benefits, performance management, learning and development, work—
life balance, and career progression. To assess progress in
human resources management, it was decided that a staff
engagement survey would be conducted every 2 years,
with the next scheduled for 2010.

The survey results were considered in ADB’s comprehensive review of the strategy, which was conducted
with the assistance of external experts. The review underscored the importance of linking ADB’s human resources
management to its business strategy to support and deliver the results required by Strategy 2020. A Board paper
on the subject was issued in December. As a next step, a
detailed action plan will be drawn up, based on the external experts’ recommendations and the Board of Director’s
comments, among other inputs.

ADB decided to conduct a staff
engagement survey every 2
years to assess progress in
human resources management

Annual Report 2008 103

 

As of 31 December, ADB's staff totaled 2,506 from 57 of its 67 members

STAFFING

ADbB’s staff as of 31 December totaled 2,506 from 57 of its
67 members: 5 members of Management, and 874 professional and 1,627 local staff, of whom 494, or about 20%,
were in field offices. Appointments and departures numbered 1 each in Management, 115 and 88 among professional staff, and 144 and 108 among local staff. Although
ADB is working hard on gender balance, the representation of women professional staff decreased from 29% (248
out of 847) at the end of 2007 to 28% (248 out of 874) of
total professional staffat the end of 2008. Women at senior
levels, however, increased from 14% (17 out of 125) at the
end of 2007 to 18% (25 out of 137) of total senior professional staff at the end of 2008.

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

Consistent with ADB’s market-based compensation system, the Board approved a 4.3% average increase in the
professional staff salary structure effective 1 January 2009
and a 5.1% performance-related salary increase. The performance bonus pool remained unchanged from 2008.
The Board also approved an average increase of 9.0% for
national officers and administrative staff at headquarters
for 2009 and an overall weighted average increase of 16.1%
for national officers and administrative staff in 28 field offices. The online salary increase and bonus distribution process was introduced, improving timeliness and efficiency.

NOILVALSININGY CNV JDNVNI4FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION |

104 Asian Development Bank

For greater efficiency and better service delivery to clients, several initiatives to streamline benefits administration were introduced. The leave management system was
fully implemented at headquarters and field offices. An
electronic medical file management system project for the
Medical Center was initiated to improve efficiency. The
online pension statement was rolled out in September,
reducing staff time and mailing costs of sending out the
monthly pension pay slips.

INTERNAL ADMINISTRATIVE
EXPENSES

Internal administrative expenses totaled $347.7 million,
compared to the budget of $357.2 million. Of the savings of
$9.5 million or 2.7%, $7.1 million or about 2% is being carried forward to 2009. The overruns in certain budget items in
operational and administrative budget categories were fully
met through reallocations from savings within the same budget categories, while the overrun in the offices of the directors under the Board of Directors budget category was met
through reallocation from the general contingency. Key drivers contributing to the overall savings were staff vacancies,
closer adherence to the staff consultant cost accrual methodology, and restructuring of the various contractual servic
es and equipment maintenance agreements. These savings

were partly offset by overrun in the staff benefits, which was
primarily because of additional contributions to the staff retirement plan to meet increasing funding requirements.

For 2009, the net internal administrative expenses
budget is $388.9 million, including the independent evaluation department budget of $8 million. The increase of
$31.7 million or 8.9% over the 2008 budget reflects a price
growth of 6.6% and a volume growth of 2.3%. The 2009
budget is net of $5.2 million of service charges estimated
to be recoverable from administrating trust funds of multilateral and bilateral institutions.

In addition to internal administrative expenses, the
2009 budget also includes an annual capital budget of
$4.1 million, mainly to fund cyclical capital expenditures
for headquarters and field offices as well as allocation for

security and safety-related expenditures.

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES

The Office of Administrative Services (OAS) improved
overall service delivery and efficiencies by upgrading
workplace safety and environment, rehabilitating buildings, optimizing costs, and reducing staff.

‘The in-country business continuity facility was completed and inaugurated in August. It serves as the backup
facility for ADB headquarters’ critical business operations

 

In March, more than 80% of staff participated in a staff engagement survey with the goal of promoting positive organizational changein case of emergencies. The offshore facility was commissioned as part of the business continuity management
strategy.

‘To improve travel services through competition, OAS
established the dual-agency model, with two new in-plant
agencies in place since October. The events management
unit, which became fully operational in July, organized
over 50 events. A hotelling facility for consultants was set
up to increase space for staff.

OAS and the Office of Information Systems and Technology jointly launched Electronic Storage and Retrieval
(eSTAR), an enterprise-wide electronic documents repository system, to make records management more efficient while ensuring security of information. OAS used
information technology in communication and printing
to boost service delivery. To support knowledge management under Strategy 2020, information coordinators were
appointed to support research on the environment, education, finance, infrastructure, and regional cooperation.

OAS launched its first greenhouse gas emissions report in June to help set emission reduction targets. Its
conservation and environmental initiatives saved over
$110,000 in electricity, water, and paper consumption.

OAS continued to identify ways to upgrade efficiency and service. It strengthened crisis management and
disaster-preparedness capabilities, and collaboration to
deal with field office building safety and security issues.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AND TECHNOLOGY

The Office of Information Systems and Technology made
progress in information technology (IT) governance, and
information management and collaboration.

The office extensively reviewed and improved its IT
governance processes and controls of financial systems to
comply with industry standards on ensuring the integrity
of ADB financial data. Strengthening the security of these
information systems continued to be a priority, with new
processes and policies put in place for the secure access
of internal and external users. As a result, risk management and change management practices were introduced,
together with the proper documentation and validation
of internal controls. A new business continuity facility was
established to ensure that ADB’s critical operations would

audits at headquarters and in
resident missions assessed the

the effectiveness of operations

be functional in the event of a major disruption at headquarters.

New channels on information sharing, such as instant
messaging, web conferencing, and collaboration workspaces, were explored to enable more direct and efficient
communication among ADB staff members, and between
ADB and external partners. Aside from rolling out a new
electronic document repository system, the office continued
delivering innovative IT solutions to minimize the need for
business travel and improve administrative efficiency.

Extensive training and workshops on the new information systems were provided to staff members at headquarters and in field offices. Significant efforts were made
to update IT staff skills.

While expanding the time and geographic coverage of
IT services, the office also developed a number of major
IT solutions to support ADB’s growing operations, including a new facility for consultants and suppliers to register
online for ADB business opportunities. Connectivity was
significantly improved for a number of field offices, and a
new connection was made to support the establishment
of the field office in Armenia.

Raising awareness of ADB's anticorruption policy among stakeholders is an important part of the Integrity Division's work

division also worked with PricewaterhouseCoopers, ADB’s
external auditors, to ensure proper coordination of audit
activities.

The division completed 24 audits in 2008. Loan,

  

grant, and technical assistance portfolios of selected headquarters divisions, countries, and resident missions were
reviewed in terms of compliance with ADB policies and
procedures and with relevant contractual agreements; accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of significant financial,
managerial, and operating information; timely achievement of significant loan and grant objectives; propriety of
disbursements of operational activities; and safeguarding
of assets. Financial and administrative audits were conducted at headquarters and in selected resident missions
to assess the reliability of financial data and effectiveness
of operations. Information system reviews covered the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) system, I'T infrastructure and security of
the Asian Development Bank Institute, and independent
verification and validation of several IT systems. Business
continuity review and disaster recovery testing of critical

systems were conducted at the new fallback sites.

The division reviewed selected borrowing, loan disbursement, and administrative expense transactions.
Several consultant contracts were audited to ensure the
authenticity of consultant claims.

The division issued five internal audit certifications
to donors of trust and grant funds, upon the request of the
Office of Cofinancing Operations and in compliance with
the technical assistance letters of agreement and/or memoranda of understanding.

The division continually monitored the progress of
outstanding recommendations, with an emphasis on high
risk recommendations.Integrity Division

The division received 186 complaints, conducted and finalized 89 investigations, conducted 4 project procurement—
related audits, and raised awareness ofADB’santicorruption
policy among staff, partners, borrowers, participants, and
stakeholders. The division concluded investigations of 13
complaints against ADB staff members during the year, and
recommended to the Budget, Personnel, and Management
Systems Department disciplinary action and enhancements to operational procedures.

ADB debarred 41 firms and 38 individuals from participating in ADB-financed activity for designated periods. It recommended ways to deter and prevent fraud and
corruption to departments, resident missions, borrowers,
and service providers. The procurement-related audits
identified potential indications of fraudulent and corrupt
activity, and recommended ways to deter abuse in ADBfinanced projects. Significantly, representatives of the
supreme audit institution of some developing member
countries formed part of the audit team for the procure
Annual Report 2008 107

ment-related audits, enabling the transfer of vital anticorruption skills and knowledge.

Division-sponsored anticorruption workshops in the
Kyrgyz Republic and Papua New Guinea were attended
by ADB resident mission staff, government officials, project officers, and supreme audit institution representatives. In the countries where procurement-related audits
were conducted, supreme audit institution representatives attended training workshops that drew on their procurement-related audit experience.

The division published its inaugural quarterly
e-newsletter in April and Frequently Asked Questions on Anticorruption and Integrity in July. It updated the Operations Manual
anticorruption section, and translated ADB’s anticorruption
policy and /ntegrity Principles and Guidelines into Lao.

The division continued to collaborate with the Joint International Financial Institutions Anticorruption Task Force.
The resultant harmonized efforts and shared information created a united front against corruption. The division regularly
reviewed its activities and approaches to ensure its outputs

were aligned with ADB’s stated direction and strategy.

* Transfers were made between budget items without exceeding the original amount of each category as well as from general contingency to meet overrun in the Board of Directors.

An amount of $963,000 was transferred from the general contingency to the offices of the directors under the Board of Directors budget category to meet overrun.

Includes $1,372,000 in expenses associated with Japan Special Fund ($1,290,000) and Japan Scholarship Program ($82,000). Excludes the following adjustments incorporated in the financial statements to comply with the generally accepted accounting principles recording and reporting requirements: (i) postretirement medical benefits ($10,931,000); (ii) actuarial assessment of costs associated with pension benefit obligations (-$3,810,000); (ili) expenses charged to the budget carryover ($3,731,000); (iv) accumulated compensated absences ($839,000);
(v) accrued resettlement and repatriation allowances ($589,000),;and (vi) other miscellaneous adjustments (-$104,000). The total adjusted administrative expenses of $329,557,000
reflected in the financial statements is allocated between OCR, $141,047,000 ($176,587,000 less $35,540,000 of front-end fee); ADF, $187,138,000 and Japan Special Fund and Japan
Scholarship Program, $1,372,000.

This amount ($5,239,000) reflects the estimated total expenses apportioned for administering the trust funds during the year.

In 2006, the Board approved a proposal to allow up to 2% of net IAE budget to be carried over to the next year beginning with the 2007 budget. Accordingly, $7.1 million (2% of the
2008 net IAE budget) has been carried over to 2009.

Selected Knowledge Products of ADB

ADB produced many “knowledge products” during 2008: operational departments produced numerous studies, and built knowledge into operations.
In addition, large numbers of technical assistance and regional technical assistance reports generated and disseminated knowledge. In addition to
that extensive work, the four designated Knowledge Departments—Asian Development Bank Institute, Economics and Research Department, Office of
Regional Economic Integration, and Regional and Sustainable Development Department—together with Independent Evaluation Department and the
Private Sector Operations Department, and the five Regional Departments—Central and West Asia Department, East Asia Department, Pacific Department, South Asia Department, and Southeast Asia Department—produced the following products in 2008:

B-loan. A tranche of a direct loan nominally advanced by
ADB, subject to eligible financial institutions’ taking funded
risk participations within such a tranche and without recourse
to ADB. It complements an A-loan funded by ADB.

Direct value-added cofinancing. Cofinancing with active coordination and formal agreements among financing partners
that bring about defined client benefits, including contractual
commitments by ADB (such as for credit enhancement, syndication, or financial administration) to facilitate mobilization,
administration, or participation in cofinancing.

Loans at risk. Loans rated as unsatisfactory or partly satisfactory for impact and outcomes or implementation progress as
articulated in the design and monitoring framework or those
that might slip into those categories.

Multitranche financing facility. A debt-financing facility to
target discrete, sequential components of large stand-alone
projects; slices (or tranches) of sector investment programs
over a longer time frame than the current norm; financial
intermediary credit lines; and guarantees.

Sovereign, nonsovereign. ADB lending is classified as sovereign or nonsovereign. A sovereign loan is guaranteed by
the national government, while a nonsovereign loan is not
guaranteed by the national government.

Nonsovereign operations refer to an ADB-financed transaction with a subsovereign, state-owned enterprise, other public
private entity, or private sector entity as obligor or investee,
normally without direct sovereign indemnity. In 2008, ADB's
nonsovereign operations supported the infrastructure, capital
market, and banking sectors, among others.

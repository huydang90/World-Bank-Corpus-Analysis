SE OE ETE PEINTRODUCTION

Asia, as a whole, has besn undergoing a process of
deep seated change since the end of the Second
World Wer, and particularly so since the commencement of an organized drive towards economic development in its various countries.

j
The largest of the land masses of the globe, it has

been the home of a more Lhan proportionate share of
the world’s population. It has, likewise, been .bome
to a more than proportionate share of the depressed
population of the world,

The history of Asia over the fast quarter century
has been dramatic. The emergence into political
freedom of one colonial or imperial possession after
another, the sense of continental or regional identity
which has been slowly seeping in, the tumultuous
political developments that have taken place, at least
two major wars and a number of limited hostilities
and the growth of Japan to a high place in the list of
advanced countries——these have been evidence of an
Asia in ferment, in tension, in transformation,

The developing countries of Asia which are
members of the Asian Development Bank have also
shared in the changes spreading over Asia. It is with
these countries, their efforts, their shortcomings and
their accomplishments that this regional review will
deal. Time-frames will be adopted as suitable to each
purpose, though in the main lhe attempt will be to
relate to the near-past. In the tace of the unevenness
or paucity of up-to-date statistical data, an attempt
will be made to cast the review in terms of lrends
rather than of precisely maasured movements.

The Content of Economic Strategy

While it is true thal the idea and the practice of
econamic and social planning have become generally
accepted among the developing countries of the
world, itis in the understanding of what planning for
economic development constitutes, rather than in its
mere acceptance as a2 tool, that the experience of the.
Region in the near pasl has been most significant.

Recent experience in the Region has underlined
the imbalances of concentration that earlier underlay
the philosophy and practice of ecanomic planning tn
the Region. important among such imbalances of
concentration were (and, from place bo place or time
to time, may still be):

(i) relative acglect of agriculture as 4 sector and
unbalanced emphasis on industrialization and/
or on infrastructure development per se;

Throughour this Report, ’S" refers to United States Dollar untoss
otherwise specified

(ii) dtrection of planning towards increasing in
vestment as such and inadequate attention to
the promotion of productivity from the investments made;

Gi) inadequate attention to internal monetary and
fiscal policy und somewhat less than appropriate concern with the risks attendant on infiation or deficit financing;

(iv} attempts to achieve external viability by importsubstitution almost at any cost with less
emphasis on the factors conducive to expansion of export earnings;

(vy) ‘non-recognition, or inadequate recognition,
till recently, of the impact of the population
problem on economic development;

(vi) inadequate attention to the development of
human capital resources; and

(vii) inadequate attention to the sociat environment
of economic growth: ta the problems of

urbanization, of redistributive mechanisms, of

social stability,

With growing realization that economic development is nat the mere establishment ot new industrial
structures or of new railroads and ports and the {ike,
the imporlance of proper policy formulation as an
essential concomitant of sound investment is becoming recognized and, in varying degrees, is being
reflected in the preparation of plans. The ambit of
policy formutation is also being widened: the provision
of incentives to maximum productivity, the rationalization of investment on the basis of consciously-made
choice between iechno-economic and socioeconomic alternatives, the integration of fiscal,
monetary and credit measures to serve the ends of
economic progress, the promotion of efficient
management, the attempts to achieve a4 social frurnework conducive to economic growth: these are
aspects of increasing awareness of the width of the
spectrum of which economic development is only the
middle band.

It is not to be claimed yet that the rectification of
Lhe imbalances of concentralion and the management
of policy have advanced uniformly or miaxinially
throughaut the Region. It is, however, a fact that
recognition of these factors has moved ecanomic
development into directions that have already started
showing important and healthy results.

Agriculture and Reiated Activities

On no other field has the impact ef change in the
recent years been so pronounced as on the priorityaccorded to agriculture. Several factors seem to have
contribuled to this change. The pressure of increasing
population on the food resources of several developing counties, the greater dependence on imported
food and the consequent further deterioration of
balance of payments situations already under strain,
the lower availability of food surpluses on liberal terms
trom outside, the break-through in the technologies of
tropical agriculture (connected in particular with the
high-yielding varieties developed in rice and wheat
and more generally with improved agricultural
practices), the realization that retardation of agriculture was in fact a drag on total economic development (rather than conducive to advancement of
industrialization) and the increased exercise of
political power now achieved by the farmer—these
seem to be some of the important factors leading to a
change in the attitude towards the agricultural sector
in economic development.

FABLE

The most evident outward results have been in the
increases in crop production, in the attampts to
increase consumption (and local production) of
fertilizers and pesticides, in the efforts towards better
seed selection and water management, in the evolutlon of appropriate agricultural credit and price
policies and, in net, in the shift of relative emphasis
from extensive cultivation to a balance between
extensive and intensive cultivation.

The results, while varying, have shown a distinct
trend for most countties, as Table | shows, in twa
crops of the greatest importance in Lhe Regian, viz.,
tice and wheat. .

In rice, which is the major staple of diet, 10 of the
countries listed below recorded increases in production well ahead of world trends over the poriod
1956-69. It is also to be noted that, while in
some years production showed a sharp dip due
essentially to adverse climatic conditions, production

generally remained, even in those years, ahead of the
1962-56 averaye. In the case of whaat, two of the
countries listed in Table | more than doubled their
output in this period.

The spread in Asia of high-yielding varieties of
cereals, notably wheat and rice, compares favorably
with the record-breaking spread of hybrid corn in the
United States in the 1950's. One estimate places the
expansion in acreage under such varieties in Asian
countries as follows:

Year Total Acres in Production
1964-65 200
1965-66 37,000
1966-67 4,800,000
1967-68 20,000,000
4968-69 34,000,600
4969-70 40,000,000

Al an estimated increment of yield of half-a-ton
per acre, the above spread would have produced in
1869-70 alone an additional 20 million tons of food
valued at more than $2 billion.

it may with truth be said that ie Green Revolution is just starting. One of the countries fisted
in Table I—one in the higher ranges of quantitative
performance—-has estimated that the proportion of
cultivators using the new seeds in rice and coarse
grains is much less than half white in wheat it is only
a little more than half. (t also reports that “the
knowledge and use of the package of practices which
constitute the new strategy does nat seem to be very
common and a qualitative break through in technology is still to be achieved.”

While these observations have no doubt parallels
in several of the developing countties of the Region,
the Green Revolution raises itnportant issues for the
policy-maker not only in the effort to get widest
acceptance but also as a result of getting increasingly
wide acceptance, An increasing number of Asian
developing countries that have been, or are, rice
exporters have to adjust to international market
conditions wherein other developing countries are,
at any rate for the present and the near future, getting
self-sufficient or nearly so and wherein the internal
agricultural policies (particularly on price support) of
developed countries may not strictly accord with free
marketability. Another set of problems arises from
the increased need of capital investment. -. and
foreign exchange—--in the agricultural sector: for
production of fertilizers, for installation of tubewells,
for mechanization of agriculture, for improving market
accessibility, for better processing, for better storage

facilities and the like. In another diraction of policymaking, the agsicultural potential opened up by the
Green Revolution has to be utilized to maximize the
benefit economically and nutritionally through a series
of steps such as diversification of crops, increase of
protein intake, development of pasture-based activities, abatemant of the flight of population into urban
areas, land tenure reform, mobilization of the increased agricultural incomes for further development
in other sectors and the spread of technology into
the rural areas. And, above all, the success of the
Green Revolution must not be allowed to lull the
developing economies into a sense of complacency
on the agricultural front —for, not far behind, there is
the haunting spectre of the population boom which,
if not controlled in time, will surely overwhelin the
aconamies.

Aspects of Infrastructure Development and
Industrial Progress

Considerable advance has been achieved by the
developing countries in the Bank’s membership in
investments in infrastructural and industrial activities.

The production of electrical energy has an
important significance not only as an indicator of,
but also as a propulsive force in, the advancement of a
country’s economy. The figures in Table Il (which
are the nearest approximations available) show the
progress made in this sector.

The figures show substantial expansion between
the low base of 1953 and the beginning of the decade.
Apart from this, in the last six years covered in
Table |I, the production (and hence consumption)
of electrical cnergy—with all its implication for
economic developmant—rose in most countries by
more than two-thitds; and in several of these there
was, within the six-year period, a virtual doubling,
and in two cases a tripling of production, :

Compared with the all-Asian and the global
figures given in Table ||, the quantum of the increase
achieved in the developing countries was small; but
the rate of expansion could, reasonably, be held to
indicate the vitality of the situation and the prospects
--- given the resources—ot Asian developing countries being further able to gainfully harness electrical
energy into the developmental process.

in another important field of infrastructure development, namely, transportation, the evidence of
progress has not been equally striking. Illusiratively,
while substantial road and rail investments have been
reported fram time to time in the Asian developingcountries, the ultimate test of advance in transporlation would seem to lie in the volume of passenger and
cargo traffic moved by rail and in the number of
carriers using the roads. Asia, Atrica and Lalin
America contain 71 per cent of all the world’s people,
but account for only 15 per cent of the world’s rail
freight and 17 per cent of the world’s trucks and
buses.* Lack of effective transportation (whether

1963-68, the Republics of China and Korea showed,
in terms of the indices of manufacturing production,
increases of 150 per cent or more. Progress in Hong
Kong and Singapore was evidently equally striking,
Progress in other members was uneven, recording,
generally, increases af about 20 to 50 per cent. These
figures, in terms of indices, are, however, not accurately indicative of the extent of industrial progress.

this is due to inadequate investments, uneconomic
policies or a combination of both) could be, and in all
probability is, a major handicap in the Region,
affecting economic development by increasing costs,
reducing mobility of the factors of production,
lowering smarket access and increasing disparities
within, and between, member states.

A teview of the content of industrial progress in the
developing countries of the Region, nevertheless,
shows important changes of far-reaching significance.
There was a diversification of production from lines
regarded as traditional till the early 1960's. The outpul
of iron and stecl, of aluminium, of machine tools and
precision instruments, of fertilizers and pesticides, of

Tuming now to industrialization, the developing .
countries of the Region registered, statistically, pro
gress in varying degrees. In the five-year period * United Nations Statistical Yearbook, 1969.

chemicals, of roiling stock, vehicles and telecommuni~
cation equipment, all rose during the period.
Important beginnings were made in the petrochemical
and the electronic industries, Industrial progress is
the sum total of investments, transfers of technology,
development of operating and managerial skills and
exploitation of markets: and of these factors the
“gestation period” for at least the last three factors
is substantial. The point to note, however, is that, in
this decade, a meaningful start was made and distinct
progress achieved,

There is indeed some indication that results are
already beginning to show. Despite many limitations,
the developing countries of the Region have not
merely been able to impart a significant amount of
momentum to their industrial progress on the basis
of import substitution, but have also begun to make
some headway inthe export field. Apart from the more
“traditional” exports, several of the developing
countries of the Region have been able to move, onan
internationally competitive basis, into exports, variously, of fisished steel, rolling stock, fishing vessels,
machine tools, telecommunication equipment, transmission equipment, actors and construction eguipment, fertilizers, electrical appliances and processed
farm products. While these constitute only a small
proportion of the world commerce in such .goods,
the fact that it has been possible io make a start is
indicative of the potential of the near future, given
the sight policies and incentives in the developing
countries and a cooperative attitude on the part of the
major world buyers—the industrialized countries.

This record of industrial pragress can be considered even more meaningful when due regard is
paid to shortcomings thal have revealed themselves
in varying degrees in the industrial sector of regional
developing countries. It may be relevant to enumerate
some of the main ones.

Judged from the point of view of the quantum
of investment already made, it is evident that there
are signiticant areas of under-utilization of industrial
capacity ever as there are in agriculture. The
reasons may be one or more of many. Tie development of management may require much greater
emphasis than hitherto. The matching of a production program to a well-devised forecast of
demand patterns may be inadequate. (nventory
contral may be haphazard and unbalanced. The
training of technical personnel to achieve maximum
productivity may be insufficient. Lack of foreign
exchange for import of raw materials, components
and spare parts may retard full utilization ot invest
ments already made. Cost-reduction efforts may
have baen relegated to the background by excessive
protectionism or by target-inspired attempts to
reach towards full production at vated capacity. Habituation to a protected domestic market may
have deprived the enterprises of the initiative and/or
the ability to tap export markets on a competitive
basis. Lack of institutional export credit arrangements may also be a hindering factor in the development of exports, There is aiso the possibility that
aberrations in the internal/external value of the
national currency may also have ied to distortions
harmful to the achievement of full results from the
investments already made.

The performance of the Region in its industrialization strategy in the past decade also yields
some valuable indicators for future policy making.
There is need for improvement in the institutional
framework: more organized credit facilities particularly for working capital needs (even though
national development banks have on the whole
performed well in the investment-credit function),
a more careful application of the import-substitution
principle in industrialization so that the scarce
resources available are put io the most genuinely
gainful use, strengthening of export incentives and
activities designed to overcome the limitations of
scale inherent in most domestic markets of the
Region, willingness fo associate with suitable
external enterprises so as to encourage a systematic
updating of technological processes and managerial
efficiency, rationalization of tariff and olher protective
methods so that they cannot be utilized by entrepreneurs to inflict high-cost production on the
consuming public and the framing of fiscal, monetary
and other economic policies that would tend to
maximize capital formation. The prospects of joint
multi-national investments in the Region need also
to be examined in detail and in concrete cases so
that the widcly-expressed aspirations to utilize the
rich natural resources of the Region to the maximum
common benefit of its population do not remain
oniy aspirations. And above all, there is the constant
need to review and enhance national investments’
in the development of human capital resources.-—
without which other investments cannot be decided
or manipulated to maximum gain; there would be
a case for a critical appraisal of the educational
policies of several countries in the Region so that
the educational system cen be made to conform
better to the needs of improvement in material wellbeing, which. is a basic objective of economic
development.Economic Development and the Growth of
Population

As the developing nations of Asia strive towards
economic development, their efforts are diluted by
the simultaneous high rate of population growth.
The fact that the growth is caused more by decreasing

mortality rates than by increases in birth rates does .

not materially change the nature of its impact on
economic development. The problem is of special
importance in Asia.

Figures show that for Asia as a whole (the major
portion of the population of which lies in the
developing areas} the annual rate of population
increase in 1963-68 was less than the corresponding
figures for the developing continents of Latin
America and Africa (2 per cent as against 2.9
per cent and 2.4 per cent, respectively); however,
this does not mean any nat advantage for Asia
since the density of population is many times
higher in Asia than in Latin America and Africa
(71 as against 13 and 11, respectively).

Further, within the developing countries of Asia
there is the special problem of certain countries
with a high density of population also having @
high population growth rate.

A high density of population, a high rate ‘of
population growth and a low per capita gross
national product present a combination of factors
which, while already prejudicial to economic growth,
it would be practically impossible to surmount
unless action on the widest scale is taken 10 arrest
the proliferation of people; postponed action will
not only need a resources mobilization beyond
anything currently foreseeable but will also in the
meantime generate (it it has not already generated)
a suppurating situation in the social structure that
may well endanger prospects for stability.

Agriculture and food suppiies have as a whole
barely managed to keep up with the expansion of
population in Asia, at decidedty low nutritional levels
and with substantial imports in several countries,
The Green Revolution in Asian countries has to be
seen in the right context in this regard; it is not an
adequate answer to the problem of population
growth; it provides at best a breathing spell within
which to effectively apply measures that would
tring the population problem under control before
the growth of population overtakes the growth in
production brought about by the Green Revolution.

tn other sectors of economic activity also, with
rare exceptions, the effect of the planning and

investment effort so far has been so much eroded
by the ever-increasing number of claimants on the
Rational product that the much-hoped-for incraase
in living standards and material well-being has not
been realized. The “revolution of rising expectations”
has bean checkmated by the “revolution of rising
population” in several countries.

In many of the developing countries of the Bank,
population control is a matter not of controversy in
principle but of effectiveness in action. Technology
in population control too is making significant
advances. The success or failure of a country's
drive towards rationalization of its population is
patently and primarily a matter of organization and
administration and may well be the historical test
of whether that country develops at all. ,

The External Account and Aid

In the post-1963 period, the external position in
respect of a numbecr—not all---of developing
member countries has shown distinct improvement,
This is partly accounted for by domestic agricultural
improvement (thereby reducing food imports and
increasing the exports of commercial crops), partiy
by increases in exports particularly of manufactured
and processed goods and partly (as in the case of
India) as a result of improved substitutive efforts
hacked up by exchange retorm when necessary.

The improvements, where they have taken place,
do not, however, alter the need of the regional
developing countries for a large net inflow of
fong-term capital from abroad including both private
capital and official aid, Even at the current rates of
economic growth which, in many of the countrics
concerned, barely keep just one slep in advance of
population growth, domestic savings are inadequate
and the import needs far exceed exports.

Figures of exporis (f.0.b.) of the regional developing member countries show a movement
fram $8,192 million in 1963 to $12,544 milfion in
1969 while imports (c.if.) movad from $10,776
million to $16,380 million in the same period.

In addition to the increasing imbalance shown
above between exporis and imports there is iri most
of the countries the pressing burden of serviceobligations on past foreign debt (even though
incurred in most cases for developmental purposes).
This latter factor is particularly important in the
countries which began their development effort in
the 1950's, when global philosophy on developmental aid fad not yel reached the stage whichmade “soft fuans” a significant element of developmental aid in the 1960's. From overall projections
made by the World Bank for South Asia and East

Asia, ‘the service payments on existing foreign .

debt, which for the two sub-regions crossed the
billion dollar level in 7968-69, will continue to
hover near the $1.2 billion level till 1975. The
gradual decrease thereafter, which is possible according to the forecasts based on existing debt,
can only materialize if further developmental aid
is given on more appropriate terms than has been
the case so far and if the case for “restructuring”
of debt is sympathetically viewed in deserving cases.

The slowness of pace in economic growth so
far in the Asian developing countries as a whole,
the continuing imbalance between exparts and
imports, and the strain of debt service payments
already felt and certain to continue for a considerable
time to come—these, basically, constitute the case
for more adequate foreign aid on truly concessional
tarms.

The evidence, however, has been that the net
aid receipts into the Asian Region have certainly
not kept pace with the need—--they have in fact
deteriorated for South Asia (Table Uf),

Ata time when a break-through in agriculture is
clearly in sight provided the resources are made
available, at a time when developing members
have shown on the whole a distinct improvement
in internal resource mobilization, at a time wien,
hopefully, trade opportunities in new fields may
open up for developing countries if investment
flaws can be maintained, the present signs of aid
fatigue are singularly tll-timed.

The developing countries of the Region have

shown that they can make effective use of additional
aid, Lessons have been learnt from past performance
both by the developing countries and the “donors” —
as evidenced by the Region's achievements in
agriculture, largely the result of its own efforts,
and the growing appreciation by the countries
supplying capital that the terms of aid are crucial
to the success of the development effort. There is
a foundation in past experience for a renewed and
reinvigorated attack on the problem of economic
growth, Not only is the time ripe for an increase in
aid flows—on appropriate terms —but organizations
such as the Asian Development Bank, as may be
seen from the following chapters of the Annual
Report, now provide increasingly more efficient
mechanisms through which aid can be channelled
and applied where it will do most good.

Asian developing countries, noting the aid fatigue
in certain parts of the worid only partly made up
for by the decisions of some other countries, as
instanced particularly by Japan, to enlarge the
quantum of their aid, also hope for further fiberalization of the terms of aid. Tha significant moves
towards the liberalization of terms made at the
session in Tokyo (September 1970) of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for
Economic Caoperation and Development are wel- °
come, as also the steps announced by the United
States in September 1970 for the untying of its
development loans to developing countries. Increase
in the quantum of aid, libaralization of terms of aid and
willingness to share skills and markets are indispensable if the economies of Asian developing
countries are to have a continuing possibility of
striving tawards, and progressively achieving, more
efficient performance and thus enhancing the wellbeing of the paopte of Asia,

Source: Organization for Economic Cooperation aid Development: Development Agsistance, 1969 and 1970 Reviews.The Bank raised its lending in 1970 by 150 per ecnt
over the previous year: Joan commitments amounted
to $245.6 million! — $211.9 million from ordinary
capital resources and $33.7 million from Special
Funds resources. Thirty-two loans, including 10
from Special Funds resources, were approved, as
against 20 in 1969 and seven in 1968,

Apart from financial assistance to national development banks, loans were sanctioned for agricultural and irrigation projects, power transmission and
distribution, construction of highways and development of sea ports and an international airport, water
supply, fisheries development, modernization of tea
factories and the exparision of a fertilizer plant,
establishment of a caprolactam plant and, for the
first time, for the establishment of textile mills and
rice mills, agricultural credit and vocational eaducation,

The Bank's loans were made to 14 countries.
Four of these countries, namely Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos, and the Republic of Viet-Nam received
Joans from the Bank for the first time: in the case of
the jattcr three countries, they were also the first
loans from ary international financing institution.

Nineteen technical assistance projects were approved for project preparation and advisory and
operational services in 10 countries at a total cost of
$2.9 million.

One major regional survey —the Study of South
east Asia's Economy in lhe 1970's-—— was completed
and another—-the Regional Transport Survey —
praceeded on schedule and is‘due for completion
in the first part of 1971.

In continuation of efforts initiated in 1969 to tap
capital markets for funds, bonds valued at the equivelent of $21.7 million were issued during the year in
Austria and Japan. Total funds raised by borrowing
thereby reached $38.1 million.

Contributions during the year to the Consolidated
Special Funds resources (excluding the Technical
Assistance Special Fund) amounted to $55,254,972,
raising total capital contributions to Special Funds
yasources to $137,934,944. Australia and the
United Kingdom made their first capital contributions, joining the four earlier contributors — Canada,
Denmark, Japan (ihree contributions) and the
Netherlands (two contributions).

Contributions were made to the Technical Assistance Special Fund by Australia, Canada, Finland,
india, Japan, Netherlands, Pakistan and Switzerland,
raising total contributions to the Technical Assistance
Special Fund to $4,091,017. In addition, the Federal
Republic of Germany renewed the offer of technical
assistance facilities made in previous years and the
United Kingdom extended the period of availability
of its earlier offer,

Two new membors, Fiji and France, joined the
Bank raising the total membership te 35 couniries.
Negotiations were proceeding at the end of the year
on the membership of the Territory of Papua and
New Guinea.

By the end of the year, the total number of staff
of the Bank reached 490 comprising 159 professional
and 331 non-professional mambars.

The achievements of the past year have been
substantial, confirming the confidence expressed in
previous Annual Reports regarding the Bank's growing invelvement in the economic development of its
Region. In a relatively short span of four years, the
Bank has become a significant source of aid in Asia
and is now supplying broadly about 30 per cent of the
over-all davelopment financing received from multilateral sources by the 16 developing member counties that have sought its assistance. The Bank's
emerging role in development financing can be
expected to grow provided that additional resources
—the need for which came sharply inte evidence as
operations intensified in the latter part of the year--—
can be assured.

18 AugustThe outstanding feature of the Bank's operations in

1976 was the rapid expansion in its lending activities.

A total of 32 logns amounting to $245-6 million!
were approved during the year in comparison with
20 loans amounting to $98-1 million in 1969. Four
sountries— Afghanistan, Cambodia,
Republic ot Viet-Nam--- received their first loans
from the Bank. The growing pace and spread of
operations attest to the magnitude of the develonment needs of the developing member countries as

well as to the Bank's growing capacity to respond 
to those neads.

A iurther noteworthy iaature was the growth in
the Bank’s Special Operations. Both the number
and amount of loans from Special Funds resources
rose substantially in the year under review: 10 loans
totalling $33-7 millian as against six loans totalling
$22 rnillion in 1969. The countries which received
concessional loans in 1970 were Afghanistan,
Cambodia, indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal,
Singapore and the Republic of Viet-Nam. In the
case of two projects, namely, the Besut Agricultural
Development Project in Malaysia and the Jute
Development Project in Nepal, the Bank provided
loans involving both ordinary capital and Special
Funds resources.

For the first time, the Bank participated with
other lenders in 197G in financing a project-—the
expansion ot the PUSRI fertilizer plant in Indonesia.
The Bank assisted in the appraisal of the Project and
shared in the financing—on concessional terms—
jointly with the International Development Association, the United States and Japan.

Cumulative lending at the end of 1970 stood at
59 loans totalling $3849 million spread over 15
countries. The growth in lending operations since
the Bank’s first loan in January 1968 is illustrated
in the following table:

New areas of lending were opened up during the
year —vocational education and agricultural credit,
The transportation sector {including airports and
harbors) received about 26 per cent of total loans
for the year followed by public utilities (23 per
cent), industry (19 per cent), development banks
(17 per cent}, agriculture (14 per cent) and education
(ane per cent). As of the end of 1970 the transportation and development banks sectors accounted

As a catalyst of investment activity in the Region,
the impact of the Bank's opcrations exlends substantially beyond the volume of its own lending.
The Bank’s loans cover orily a part of the total costs
of the projects financed by it. There is always the
local cost to be meat by local tinancing: in certain
cases, a part ot the cost may also have ta be bame
by other external resources. The total cost of
projects directly undertaken by the Bank as of 31
Decermber 1970 was around $700 million. ‘The
Bank financed roughly 42 per cent of this overall
cosl leaving the developing member countries to
mobilize the remaining part from local and other
sources. In addition to loans directly for projects,
the Bank has lent $80 million to development
banks for relending. Substantial local resources will
have to be mobilized to supplement these development bank loans. On balance, tte Bank's cumulative
lending of $385 million will be instrumental in
generating investment of local resources of the
sare order, tf not mare. .

Development Banks

Attention has bean drawn in previous reports to
the importance attached by the Bank to lending
through intermediary institutions. Ouring 1970 the
Bank approved three loans—-of the “credit line”
lype——ainounting to $40 million to institutions
geared to the financing of industrial development,
namely, the Korea Development Bank ($10 million);
the industrial Development Bank of Pakistan ($15
million, the second toan to this institution}; and the
Private Development Corporation of the Philippines
($15 million, also lhe second toan to this institution),

In addition, \tree loans to development financing
institutions were made in 1970 for tinancing
specific identified enterprises in particular sectors
where the individual projects were not large enough
to warrant their direct supervision by the Benk.
Two of the three loans of this type were made to
the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation, the first in an amount of $3-1 million for
the establishment of two modern tice mills, the
second in an amount of $12 million for the establishment of seven cotton spinning mills; the third loan,
in an amount of $3-5 million, was made to the
Central Bank of Ceylon for the Modernization of
Tea Factories (a follow-up lo a similar loan made
in. 1968).

A new dimension was reached in this general
area of lending to intermediary institutions with the
approval during the year of three loans to agricultural
development banks. The loans were made to the
Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal ($2-4
million), the Agricultural Development Bank of
Pakistan ($6-7 million) and the Agricuitural Develop
ment Bank of Viet-Nam ($2-5 million) for (i) pump
sets and tractors for farmers, (ii} mechanization of
fishing operations and cold storage and (ili) mechanized fishing operations, respectively. The joan
to the Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal
emerged as a result of technical assistance extended
by the Bank in 1968 and 1969. In addition, a
fechnical assistance grant of $146,000 for the
assignment of advisors to the Bank was approved
concurrently with the loan. The loan to Viet-Nam
was also accompanied by e technical assistance
grant— $68,000 for the services of advisors.

Technical Assistance

There was a significant increase in technical
assistance (services to member countries} during
the year. Nineteen technical assistance projects in
10 counties were approved involving a_ total
assistance of $2-9 million. Cumulatively, technical

 

Heer Seaassistance commitments (excluding regianal
activities) reached $6,350,000 for 43 projects in
14 countries.

The new commitments covered important sectors
of economic development including rural development programs, agricultural credit, irrigation and

flood control, industrial development, fisheries and °

electric power supply and transmission. The sectoral
spread of teclinical assistance activitics to date is
shown in the table below.

Project preparation was again an important
feature of technical assistance activities in 1970.

Of the 19 new commitments, seven were for preparation of projects which are expected to lead
directly to loan applications. In addition, increased
attention was given to technical assistance for
project implementation in several cases.

Of the 43 tachnical assistance projects approved
since 1967, 15 had been completed by the end of
1970 at an actual cost of $1:6 million. Technical
assistance activities have been financed partly from
net income and partly from contributions to the
‘lechnical Assistance Special Fund.’ For details of
utilization of this Fund, see page G2.

A. LENDING POLICIES

During the year, reviews were undertaken and, where
necessary, decisions made on several matters of
policy affecting loan operations. Among the specific
items were the interest rate for loans out-of ordinary
capital resources, the commitment charge, guarantee and other sceurity arrangements, foreign exchange
financing of local currency expenditures, review of
loan amortizelion terms, policy on lending to national
development banks and export financing, Apart from
interest rate and commitment charge, no changes
were made in existing practices. Cartain matters,
such as expart financing, were held over for further
consideration in 1971.

Interest Rate

The most significant policy development in the
Bank's operations in 1970 was the increase in its
regular lending rate, from 6-7/8 per cent to 7-1/2
per cent, offective from 28 May (the rate includes
a commission of one per cent). Since the adaption
of the vid rate af 6-7/8 per cent in February 1968,
there had been substantial changes in market
conditions in almost all important capital markets.
The yields on long-term bonds had gone up by
more than one percentage point almost everywhere.
The costs of lwo bond issues by the Bank in 1989
and carly 1970 were higher than the old lending
rate. Since the time the Bank first fixed its lending
rate in early 1968, other international financing
institutions, including the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American
Development Bank and the European Investment
Bank, had raised their lending rates. Due to the
comparétively lawer rate charged by the Bank, the
participations in the early maturities of loans by banks
in the United States, Europe and Japan had tapered
off to an insignificant amount. in these conditions,
the Bank, while wanting tc mest the needs of the
borrowing couniries by providing funds at the
lowest possible rate and also not wishing to impair
ite ability to raise substantial funds in the world’s
capital markets, finally decided to raise its rate of
interest by 6/8 of one per cent. The increased
rale was applied to all Joans approved after 28
May 1970. i :

In the case of toans to development banks
approved prior to 28 May, it had been agreed that
they would be charged the rate prevailing at the
time the amount of a sub-ioan was credited to
their accounts. However, with the decision to
increase the Bank’s rate of interest, an offer was

“made to them of a fixed lending rate of 6-7/8 per

cent on the uncommitted portions of their loans,
This offer has been accepted by all the development
banks concerned. :

Commitment Charge

In conjunction with the review of the lending rate
policy, the Bank also examined its cammitment
charge. The Bank's commitment tee for loans out
of ordinary capital resources was fixed at 3/4 of
one per cent per annum in 1968. The major consideration for charging a commitment fee is the
“opportunity cost," ie., the difference between the
actual return an money invested and the potentially
higher return from alternative uses in cases whera
there is less rieed to consider liquidity requirements.
In early 1970, the changes in interest rates in the
world capital markets made the difference hetween
the return on short-term and long-term myestments
less pronounced than two years before. With a
view to having a commilment charge corresponding
More closely to the reality of the situation, the
Bank decided to reduce its commitment charge to
one-half of one per cent per annum effective fram
28 May 1970.

Loan Administration

Commensurate with the increased loan approvals
during the year, increased attention was paid to
matters relating to follow-up and project iniplementation. Several missions to review or supervise the
implementation of projects were sent out in the
course of the year. The findings of these missions
and the discussions held with the project authorities
have contributed to make loans effective more
expeditiously. These have also expedited appointment of consultants, procurement and project implementation, thus leading 10 a speedier utilization
ef Joans. In the case of nalional development
banks, improved procedures for the utilization of
the credits were worked out; in particular, steps
wera taken to expedite the handling of applications
from sub -borrowers in order to expedite approvals.B. COUNTRY ACTIVITIES: LOANS

The purpose of the loan is to provide financial
assistance to the Government of Afghanistan in the
improvement ot the water supply and irrigation
systems in the Gawargan and Chardarrah areés,
both located in the mid-Kunduz Basin. The Project
was a sequel to the technical assistance approved
by the Bank for the investigation of 16 irrigation
projects and for project preparation of four or five
of the most promising projects for possible financing
by the Bank.

Under the Project, two parmanent intake structures
will be constructed in the Kunduz River, one to
supply water to the Gawargan area and the other
to the Chardarrah area. The combined net irrigable
araa under the Project will be raised from about
22,600 hectares to 25,300 hectares capable of
producing 28,000 tons of wheat, 48,000 tons of
sugary beet and 19,000 tons of cotton as compared
with 9,000 tons, 18,000 tons -and 4,400 tons,
respectively at present. The increased wheat andl
sugar beet production will result in considerable
foreign exchange savings on imports and the higher
cetton output will make a significant contribution to
the country’s export earnings.

Total cost of the Project is estimated at $8,510,000
of which the foreign exchange component amounting
to $5,520,000 is to be financed by the loan of
$5,750,000: and a technical assistance grant of
$370,000 from the Bank, approved concurrently

29The object of the Joan is to assist in financing the
rehabilitation of pump irrigation systems at 'Gambarsari arid Pesanggrahan in Central Java covering
an area ot over 20,000 hectares, mostly under rice
cultivation. This is the second loan by the Bank to
Indonesia for irrigation develapment, the first being
for the nearby Tadjum Irrigation Project.

The existing pumps in the Project area, which
lift water from the Seraju River, are aver 30 years
of age and are no longer economic to operate.
There is also a shortage of power for the operation
of pumps. Both these factors have resulted in an
inadequate supply of water and consequent loss of
rice production. The Bank’s loan is to assist in
the improvernent of water intakes, pumping stations
ane dasitting facilities and the construction of power
generating stations at Garnbarsari and Pesanggrahan. The tota! cost of the Project is $3-6 million
out of which the Bank is financing the foreign
exchange cast of $2°7 million, the local cost being
borne by the Government.

At full production, the Project area would
produce about 100,000 tons of milled rice compared
with the current production of about 50,000 tons,
thereby conserving foreign exchange which would
otherwise be required for rice imports.

The loan forms part of financial assistance totalling
$660,000, including $150,000 on a grant basis, to
the Government of Korea for a feasibility study of
the Andong Dam Multi-Purpose Development Project. The development of Andong Dam was
accorded high priority among the dams identified in
a pre-investment survey of the Naktong River

' Basin by the Korean Government with the assistance

of a United Nations Devclopment Programine and
Food and Agriculture Organization Team.

The Naktong River Basin supports nine million
people, representing 31 per cent of the total population. About 21 per cent of the country’s
cultivated area is in the Basin and over 30 per cont
of the country’s industrial output is produced here.

The work will be carried out in two stages. The
first stage will involve a study of the various feasibility
aspects of the proposed Andong Dam and determination of its scope. The second stage, after
approval of the feastbility study by the lorean
authorities, will involve the preparation of preliminary engineering designs, specifications and
tender documents suitable for international bidding.

The proposed Andong Dain will be a multipurpose development scheme located on the Naktong River proper. It will consist of a rock-filled
dam with a hydro-power plant and development
schemes tequirad for water management and flood

control, Rough estimates indicate that the total

range water supply development plan in Malacca
and includes the construction of a 4,000 million
gallon storage reservoir, a new traatment works
and a new pipeline system, and expansion of the
existing intake works and pumping station.

Although water services have been extended
and new supply sources have been added in the
past in Malacca, reliable yield at times of low river
flows is stil! inadequate. Moreover, the water

supply is the responsibility of two separate entities.
The Project, which is scheduled to’ be completed
by 1974, is expected to integrate the two existing
systems and to increase the reliable yield tram the
present level of about four million gallons per day
to some 16 million gallons per day, sufficient to
satisfy the projected demand up to 1980, The
Project will reduce the danger of contamination,
provide a base for a modern water-borne sewerage
system and is also expected to encourage the
establishment of industries in the State.

The total cost of the Project is estimated at
$10,846,000. The local currency requirements will

Approved: 23 December 1970
Borrower: REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES

The Bank loan is to finance the foreign exchange
cost of the improvernent of the Cotabato-‘General
Santos Road siluated in Mindanao, one of the
southern islands of the Philippines. The Project
forms‘an integral part of the Pan-Philippine Highway
cannecting North Luzon to Zamboanga in South
Mindanao, important sections of which are to be
implemented in the current Four-Year Development
Plan (1970/71 -1973/74),

Mindariao is a region of vast economic potential,
particularly in respect of agriculture and forestry
and related industries. While its population has
grown at an annual rate of more than five per cent,
production of food crops increased at about seven
pet cent per annum and timber output nearly
doubled during 1964-68. However, inadequate
infrastructural facilities, particularly roads, have set
limits to the fuller utilization of Mindanao’s develop
ment potentialities. The improvement of major
trunk roads has therefore been accorded high priority.

The Cotabato-General Santos Road is a primary
highway connecting the two main port cities of
Cotabato and General Santos, lt has a length of
approximately 209 kilometers, out of which only
15 kilometers are presently paved. Traffic has been
increasing at an annual rate of 10 per cant. The
Project to be financed by the Bank involves tie
constuction of the road to two-lane standards ‘with

Technical Assistance

4 technical assistance grant to the National Food
and Agriculture Council (NFAC) amounting to
$36,000 was approved by the Bank on 7 July.
The purpose of this technical assistance is to
provide the NFAC with the services uf an expert in
fish marketing. The expert is to help organize the
fish unit in the Marketing and Finance Division of
NFAC, to study the problems in the existing marketing
structure and operation of fish products (including
processing, grading und pricing), ta develop measures 10 Overcome the deficiencics in the existing
system, lo assist in the devclopment of training
programs for personnel working at various markel
operations and to identify projects in the field of
fish marketing which might have scope for possible
Bank financing in the future.

The two year operation of the Irrigation Water
Management Project was successfully completed
in August. The emphasis in the second year
operations was laid on system-wide operations
based on the experience obtained from the pilot
operations during the first year. As a result of
assured irtigation water management, tarmers have
been abie to extend their cultivated areas in the dry
season, introduce modern agricultural farming in
cluding high-yielding varieties, fertilizer and other
neccessary inputs, ane increase rice production by
more than 40 par cent compared with two years ayo.

Training was another important feature of this

 

a42

project. While .the first thea in-service training
sessions were given by the Bank experts to engineers
of the National Inigation Administration (NIA), the
last session was conducted by NIA counterparts for
18 irrigation engineers, water masters and ditchtenders. A “Manual on irrigation Water Management” was completed through the joint efforts of
the Bank experts and NIA counterparts.

Partly as a result of this technical assistance
activity, a seminar on Weter Management at the
Farm Lavei was organized in the Philippines in
October jointly by the United Netions Development
Programme and the Fond and Agriculture
Organization in cooperation with the Philippine
Government,

Singapore International Airport in 1969 amounted to
over 1,350,000 passengers and 18,000 metric tons
of air cargo. During the four-year period from
1965 to 1969, the volume of air passenger traffic
as well as air cargo has nearly doubled. Even on
modest projections, air tratfic is expected to nearly
double in five years. With the additional facilities
to be provided under the Project, the airport will be
able to handle the projected traffic up to 1982

PUB is an autonomous public corporation responsible for the supply of water, electricity and gas
in Singapore. Demand for water mat by PUB in
1965 totalled approximately 84 million gallons per
day, which increased to abaut 103 miltion gallons
per day by 1969. By 1980 the total demand for
water is axpacted to reach 187 million gallons
per day.

The Project involves the construction of a dam
at the estuary of the Kranji River on Singapore
Island as well as a water treatment plant and an
extension of the water distribution systems as part
of an overali extension of Singapore's water
development and distribution progratn for the 1970's.
With the construction of the dam at the mouth of
the Kranji River, a reservoir will be formed which
will be fed by the waters from the Kranji River and

the run-off from the surrounding catchment areas.

By mid-1975 when the Project will be operational,
it is expected to havé the potential of contributing
30 million gallons per day of treated water towards
the projacted demand of about 140 million galloris

c. REGIONAL ACTIVITIES

Regional Transport Survey

The Regional Transport Survey, undertaken by the
Bank in response to a request received from Southeast
Asian countries, made satisfactory progress during
the year. The Survey covers seven countries:
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and the Republic of Viet-Nam. The overall
objective of the Survey is to provide a basis for
coordinated development of transportation in the
Southeast Asian region. St is being conducted by
a team of consultants appointed by the Bank.

The first stage of the Survey aimed at the preparation of an Inception Report by the consultants
to spell out the precise scope and methodology of
the Survey, This was completed towards the end
of 1969 and was considered by the Bank's Steering
Committee in January. The Cornmittee, after reviewing the Inception Report, suggested certain:
modifications in the consultants’ plan and
methodology. Work on the second stage of the
Survey, taking account of the modifications and
changes of emphasis recommended by the Steering
Committee, was authorized in March.

The progress of the Survey was again reviewed
by the Steering Committea in July and in Novernber.
The Committes emphasized tne dual products. of
the Survey, namely a basic pragram of action in
relation to transport development in the region and
a continuously useful approach and methodology ta
planning of transportation development in future,
The Committee made several suggestions designed
to ensure that the products of the Survey would be
delivered within the available time and resources.
The Committee expressed confidence in the quality
of the final output expected from-the Survey and its
contribution to integrated regional development.
The Survey is expected to be completed by the end
of March 1971 when the draft final report is due
from the consultants.

The Survey is expected to cost, in all, $29
million. Soth the United Nations Development
Programme and the United States Government are
contributing to ihe cosl. The United Nations
Development Programme has allocated $1,142,530
for studies of maritime and air transport to be
undertaken as part of the Survey with the Bankacting as executing agency. The United States
Government has given a grant of up to $1 million
to the Bank's Technical Assistance Special Fund to
be used for the Survey. The balance of the cost is
being met by the Bank from its own resources,
including the technical assistance contributions of
member countries.

It is expected that the Survey, on completion,
will lead te the identification of priority projects,
both national and regional, in the financing of
which the Bank may share,

Southeast Asia’s Economy in the 1970's

A policy-ortented study of ‘Southeast Asia‘s
Economy in the 1970's” was requested in 1969
by the Fourth Ministerial Conference for Economic
Development of Southeast Asia. An Expert Group
met to detarmine the major questions to be studied,
and work by 12 consultants who came from six
different countries within and outside of the region
was undertaken in late 1969 and early 1970. An
Advisory Committee composed of representatives
of ihe eight participating countries helped ensure
smmouth conduct of the Study and reviewed prograss at various stages. A limited number of copics
of the final report has been provided and distributed
to the countrics concerned and within ihe Bank
for official use. Some of the major findings and
recommendations of the Study as presenied in the
Overall Report are summarized below:

Southeast Asian countries can expect to enjoy a
rapid rata of economic development in the 1970's,
However, much will depend on the internal policies
which countries adopt at the present time.

The urgency of export-oriented, outward-looking
development policies is stressed. Such policies
would help realize the potential of the Green
Revolution, would establish firm ground for growth
of competitive industries, would carn foreign exchange through expanded trade and would stimulate
private foreign investment. Sound population policy
should be an integral part of Southeast Asian
countrics’ approaches to ihe future. Furthermore,
careful attention to changing conditions of national
defense, arising in part irom the anding of hostilities
in Viet-Nam and from reduction of British forces in
the Region, will be required. By contrast, continuation of policies and practices which favor
import-oriented protected economies, and failure to
observe objective economic criteria of costs and
benefits, will be self-defeating in Lhat these policies
will not overcome the narrowness of domestic
markets, will not reduce the dualism between rural

and urban areas and will not lead to increased
employment.

The major challenye presented by the Green
Revolution is to take advantage of its full economic
potentialities. Self-sufficiency in rice production may
be an impressive technical achievement but it will
have grave consequences if obtained through
artificial means which are not sustainable in the
long tun. Prices to consumers must be kept low
to help increase domestic savings. Investments

‘aimed at improving the efficiency of exisling

irtigation systems are often preferable to huge dams.
To promote productivity, effective links providing
credit and other inputs to farmers at reasonable
prices, and connecting farmers’ output with adequate
markets are needed. Emphasis should generally be
on diversification and on intensive rather than
extensive agriculture; small scale farming can create
rusal employment.

Apart from its direct effects on the volume of
food production, the Green Revolution is considered
to be potentially the most important factor ta be
taken into account in any new strategy of industrialization. Positive effects of tha Grean Revolution
arise from a mix of factors: it makes possible the
release of food-producing Jand for other crops, thus
providing a steady stream of raw materials for
domestic processing; higher incomes for farmers can
create large markets for manufectured -inputs such
as fertilizer and implements; lower costs of foad for
urban workers can help keep the prices of manu:
factured output low in domestic and international
markets, and at the same time generate internal
demand for manufactured products. In these and
other ways, the Green Revolution can provide a
major stimulus to industrial growth.

The need for competitive exports is particularly
acute in the manufacturing industry sector, Further
pursuit of import substitution and protection strategies will lead to higher costs and more balance of
payments difficulties. With appropriale exchange
Tates, tariff adjustments and other measures, Southeast Asian countries should encourage primary
processing, mass consumption and export industries.
Adoption of a new strategy of industrialization will
entail difficult and painful adjustment of policics,
but it is this course which offers the greatest promise
in the long run.

The resource endowments of Southeast Asian
countries are complementary with Lhe needs of
fasl-growing nearby countries such as Japan,
Australa, and the Republics of China and Korea:
exports of manufactured products ’and of processed
raw materials will be able to fill growing demand

474s

in these countries, especially if the importing
countries adopt reasonable value-added tariffs,
Timber, mineral fuels and mineral ores are sectors
of particular promise. !f Southeast Asian countries
will encourage forcign investors to develop natural
resources, foreign investment can help provide
financial means as well as connections with world
markets. Host countries should ensure, however,
that they receive full economic rent for their resources.

“To concentrate only on policies to raise the rate
of growth of national output while neglacting
population control is like fighting with one arm
tied behind one's back,” says Prof. Hla Myint in
his Overall Raport in the Study. The case for
controlling population is overwhelmingly strong
and benefits from such efforts accrue in the short
term as well as the long term.

The problems faced by the Republic of Viet-Nam
in making the transition to a peace time economy
are not unique to that country alone; virtually all
Southeast Asian countries must come to grips with
increasing burdens of national defense and with
questions of how to obtain maximum development
impact from security expenditures. The Study
makes a number of recommendations on how this
may be achieved, both by the countries themselves
and with international assistance.

The timeliness of the Study makes it desirable that
itbe circulated widely as early as possible. The Overall
Report was made public in December 1970; the
entire Study is expected to be printed for commercial
distribution in 1971,

Fourth Regional Conference of Development
Banks of Asia-1969: Follow-Up Activities

A study to ascertain the training facilities currently
available to clevelopment banks and to examine the
possibilities for improvements in this respect was
commenced during the year, The study is expected
to be completed in 1971.

Asian Vegetable Research and Development
Center

The Bank approved in March 1969 a financial
contribution of $300,006 to support the establishment and operation of the proposed Asian Vegetable
Research and Development Center in response to
a request trom the Government of the Republic of
China on behalf of seven participating countries.
Consultations among the participating countries
are continuing tor successful realization of the Project,

Law Association for Asia and Western Pacific
Credit and Security Research Project

In August the Bank approved the provision of a
financial contribution amounting to $27,000 to
enable extension of te Law Association for Asia
and Western Pacifis (LAWASIA) Credit and Security
Research Project to the point where 10 ‘individual
country reports and one integrated report will be
prepared for publication. The Project is a regional
one involving a study of the security arrangements
which ase available to national development banks
and similar financial institutions in supplyiria medium
and long-term credits. The countries included ia
the study are Australia, Ceylon, Republic of China,
Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia,
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. LAWASIA is
carrying out the study.

The Project started in February 1969 with the aim
of producing, by the end of September 1970, one
integrated report covering all the 10 countries
included in the study. In the course of the study,
however, the importance of the need to prepare
individual country reports in addition to the integrated
yeport was realized, and the necessary funds were
accordingly approved for the extension of the
Project until about the end of April 1977.

Up to the time of the Bank's contribution, the
Project was undertaken with a grant of $25,000
fram the Ford Foundation, which the Bank
administered,D. RELATIONS WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

in accordance with its Chartes, the Bank continued
to maintain close relations with its sister institutions,
the {nternational Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and the other regional banks, and also
with the United Nations and its various organs and
specialized agencies, particularly the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. Relationships
have largely been of an informal character-— visits
by staff members on both sides for discussions on
current matters of mutual interest and participation
in meetings and conierences of other bodies
concerned with economic development in the Asian
Region including the meetings of the consultative
groups organized by the World Bank. The Interim
Arrangement tor Cooperation with the Food and
Agriculture Organization and the joint arrangements
for the’ collection of debt-servicing data with the
World Bank continued,

Relationships with institutions with which the
Bank has had regular contact during the past year
are summarized in the following paragraphs.

United Nations Development Programme

Since 1969, the Bank has had an informal interim
working arrangement for regular consultations and
exchange of infarmation on specific projects with
ihe United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), This working relationship with UNDP has
grown closer with the intensification of the Bank's
operational activities. The Bank has received from
UNDP summaries of new requests for pre-investment
assistance from Asian countries and also descriptions
of pre-investment projects approved by UNDP.
The Bank has conveyed to UNDP its comments on
new requests and its provisional interest in certain
approved pre-investment projects as possibilities
for Bank financing. it has also kept UNDP informed
about its loan and technical assistance activities.
Frequent exchanges of views have taken place
between the Bank missions and UNDP Resident
Representatives in the Bank’s nmiember countries.
In addition, as reported elsewhere, UNDP contributed $1,142,530 in 1970 tor the Regional
Transport Survey being conducted by the Bank,

international Bank for Reconstruction and
Deveiopment

Along with the rapid expansion of the Bank's
operational activities, closer cooperation between
the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) and the Bank was developed
in 1970. Frequent consultations and exchanges of
information took place concerning the landing
practices, status of individual projects and country
economic situations, etc. Members of the staff of
the two Banks visited each other at the respective
headquarters as occasions permitted and also had
discussions in the field on matters of mutual interest.

Observers from the Bank attended the aid
coordination meetings convened during the yaar by
IBRD on behalf of Pakistan, the Philippines and.
Thailand.

From 1968 the Bank has participated in a joint
cooperative project with IBRD in the colicction and.
processing of data on the external debt of the
regional developing member countries. A new
manual and forms for reporting external debt and
grants were distribuicd to ihe member countries
early in 1970. This newly adopted collection
system is oxpected to improve the coverage of
external debt data which ave reported by member
countries of both institutions

The Bank participated in the |BRD-sponsored
conference of economic departments or offices of
regional development banks to exchange information
on the status of economic studies in the various
banks, and on economic work in progress. This was
a very informative conference, and procedures for
further exchange of information among the banks
were developed. ~ .

The Bank's first joint lending project with a
member of tha IBRD family—the Intemational
Development Association (IDA)— was the financing
of part of the foreign exchange cost for the expansion
of Indonesia’s PUSRI Fertilizer Plant in South
Sumatra, The United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) and the Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund (QECF) of Japan also shared in
the financing. Of the project's estimated foreign
exchange cost of $68 million, the loan approved by
the Bank was $40 million while the loans extended
by IDA, USAID and OECF amounted to $30 million,
$20 million and $8 million, raspectively.

Food and Agriculture Organization

Close consultations arid exchanges of views have
taken place between the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAQ) and the Rank on agricultural

4950

projects and related activities in the Bank's developing
member countries. Several FAO experts have bean
invited as consultants to participate in Bank missions
in the agricultural sector. The annual FAO/UNDP/
ADB Review Meeting was held in May 1970 to
discuss various agricultural projects for possible
investments. In addition, the Bank has sent observers
for certain meetings and seminars sponsored by
FAQ in the field of agricultural development.
The annual review of the Interim Arrangement for
Cooperation was postponed to January 1971.

United Nations Economic Commission for
Asia and the Far East

The Bank has been in continuous coritact with the
Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East
{ECAFE) in several areas of mutual interest.
Discussions have been continuing on the implementation of the Regional Industrial Survey in which
the Bank has taken a close interest. The Bank has

“also sent observers to several ECAFE meetings

including those on Regional Trade, an Asian Clearing
Union and an Asian Reserve Bank.

The Bank also participated actively in the special
lecture seties of the Asian Statistical Institute jn
Tokyo. This newly created Institute was organized
by ECAFE with the cooperation of member countries
in the Region

United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization

In connection with the decision by the Bank to
explore possibilities for educational projects in the
areca, an exchange of views was begun with the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural

Organization for the purpose of exploring evaluation
techniques in regatd to educatiun projects and
ideas on technical education projects in the Region.

Organization for Econemic Cooperation and
Development

The activities of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development—and particularly
the mectings and studies arranged by its Development
Assistance Committee (DAC)—have been of continuing interest to the Bank especially in relation to
the efforts made to achieve global understanding
of the development needs of developing countries
and a realistic approach towards meeting such
problems. Reflecting this interest in the DAC’s
activities, President Takeshi Watanabe attended the
Annual High-Level Meating of DAC in Tokyo in
September and led a discussion on the topic of
“Financia! Aid to Asia.”

Mekong Committee

The Bank has continued to watch with close
interest developments in the work of the Committee
for Coordination ot Investigations of the Lower
Mekong Basin and has been represented at meetings
of the Committee. The Bank was represented at a
Mekong Duonor’s meeting in Copenhagen in Saptember convened by the World Bank. $t also
participated in the Amplified Mekong Basin Plan
Seminar held in Bangkok in November. The Bank
will continue to take a positive interest in the development of Mekong projects and to maintain close
consultation and cooperation with the four riparian
countries, the Mekong Commitice, the World Bank
and others with similar interests.i

Capital Subscription

The fifth and final instalment of subscriptions to the
Bank’s original paid-in capital from 31 member
countries fell due on 22 August and was duly
paid. Switzerland and Hong Kong which became
members of the Bank on 29 December 1967 and
27 March 1969, respectively, paid their respective
fourth and second instalments of subscriptions to
the Bank's paid-in capital on or before the due dates.

Fiji became a member of the Bank on 2 April,
subscribing $1 millian to the Bank's capital. The
paid-in portion of Fiji’s subscription amounts to
the equivalent of $500,000 to be paid in five equal
annual instalments, the first of which was paid
on 28 March,

France also became a member of the Bank
during the year under review and subscrihed to
the Bank's capital in tha amount of $25 mitlion.
Of the subscribed’ capital, the paid-in portion
amounts to $125 million to be paid in five equal
annual instalments. France paid its first instalment
to the Bank’s paid-in capital on 27 July.

Total subscriptions of members to the authorized
capilal stock of the Bank stood at $1,004 million at
the end of the year. Total subscriptions in convertible currencies paici under Article 6. 2(a) of the
Articles of Agreement amounted to the equivalent
of $244-55 million and under Article 6. 2(b) in
members’ own currency, or in the form of promissory
notes, amounted to the equivalent of $244-55
million, of the subscription paid under Article 6. 2(b),
convertible currency funds amounted to the equivalent of $167 million. Total commitments of loans
to he financed trom these resources amounted to
$304,635,000' and disbursements thereunder to
$24,860,000. With the expansion of its lending
activities, the Bank had under examination towards
the end of the year the need for an increase of its
capital stock, This has become urgently necessary
in order to provide the Bank with adequate resources
to continve its ordinary operations on the present
scale.

Investment of Bank Funds

At the end of 1970 the Bank's investments of
convertible currency funds (held in 18 currencies}
amounted to the equivalent of $293,470,498 of
which 30 per cent was held in government securities
os government-guaranteed obligations af member
countries ang 70 per cent in time deposits with or
certificates of deposit of banks in member countries
and with the Bank far International Settlements,

» Loan Participations

The continued high interest rates in the capital
markets of the world during the first three quarters
of the year made it financially unattractive for the
commercial banks to participate in Bank loans
despite the increase in the Bank's standard lending
sate to 7-1/2 per cent per annum in May. Sy the
final quarter of the year, commercial banks in the
United Siates, Japan and Europe had resumed
interest in such participatians. Since the comrnencement of the Bank’s operations, these participations
have amounted to $5,060,000, thus udding to the
resources available to the Bank for further lending.

Income and Expenditure

With the payment of the last instalment of capital
subscriptions to the Bank's original paid-in capital,
there was a4 further incteasc in the funds available
with the Bank for investment. During the first half
of the year the interesl rates in world money markets
continued to be tligh. In the latter half of the year,
more particularly during the last quarter, there was
a substantial decrease in short-term rates all over
the world, specially in the United States. The gross
income of the Bank during the year amounted to
$20,704,775. The gross expenditure (including
services to member countries) during the year was
$9,265,299, so that the net income, after appropriating commission an laans aggregating $139,321
to Special Reserve, in accordance with Articles 16. 1
and 17, was $11,300,185, compared with $5,503,902
in 1968. This net income ts available for allocation
by the Board of Governors in accordance with the
provisions of Article 40. 1,

Member Currencies: Changes in Value

On 17 April a new foreign exchange system was
introduced in Indonesia under which a single
exchange rate was established, This rate was set
initially at 378 rupiahs per dollar and continued al
that rate up to the end of the year. As a consequence,
Indonesia paid an additional amount of its currency
to the Bank in accordanca with Article 25. 1.

Bank's Barrawing Operations

Following its first bond issue in the Federal Republic
of Germany in September 1969, the Bank made a
second issue in Austria in April and a third issue
in Japan in November.

The issue in Austria was in the amount of 130
million schillings ($5 million) bearing a coupon
rate of seven per cent per annum at the issue price
ot 98-1/2 per cent. The bonds have a 12-year
maturity and will be redeemed in an instalment of
10 million schillings on 7 April 1972 and in 10
annual instalments each of 12 million schillings on
1 Aprilin each of the years 1973 to 1982. The issue
was placed through an Austrian banking syndicate
headed by the Creditanstalt-Bankverain and the

Osterreichische Landerbank, A.G.. and the borids
were listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange.

The issue in Japan was in the amount of six
billion yen ($16-7 million) and, apart from being the
Bank's first bond issue in Asia, was the first instance
in which Japanese Yen bonds were sold to the
public in Japan by any foreign entity (international
organizations included). The Japanase Yen donds,
bearing 7-4 per cent interest and having a sevenyeat maturity period, were offered for-public sale at
a price of 99 per cent. The bonds are redeemable
trom 1973 in four equal annual instalments of 360
million yen each and the final instalment of
4,560,000,000 yen is payable on 1 December 1977.
The managing underwriters for the issue are:
The Nomura Securities Co., Ltd. (Representative);
The Daiwa Securities Co., Ltd.: The Nikko Securities
Co., and Yamaichi Securities Co, Ltd. The commissioned banks for the issue are; The industrial
Bank of Japan, Limited (Representative); The Bank
of Tokyo, Ltd. and The Fuji Bank, Limited.

The Bank continued the process of obtaining
qualification legislation in the various states of the
United States that would give its bonds as favorable
a position with respect to rogulated investors as
ihat eryoyed by bonds of the international Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and the InilerAmerican Development Bank.. Follawing enactment
of legislation in Calitarnia, Colorado, Connecticut,
Hawaii, lilinois, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey,
New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington in
1968 and 1969, additional action was laken in 1970
in lowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Virginia and Wisconsin.
This program of bond qualification which is te be
pursued in additional states in subsequent years,
sets the hasis far successful entry of the Bank in
the United States market when it seeks to issue
its bonds.SUBSCRIPTIONS TO

ba shownThe Bank received the first contributions to its CONTRIBUTIONS TO SPECIAL
Special Funds tesources in 1967. By the end of
December 1970, contributions’ to the Consolidated FUNDS RESOURCES ‘ 1967-70
Special Funds amounted to $127,450,9612 ellocated :
as follows: Agricultural Special Fund, $23,104,972, (MILLION $)
Multi-Purpose Special Fund, $100,254,972 and
Technical Assistance Special Fund, $4,091,017.
In addition to the contributed resources in the
Mutli-Purpase Special Fund is an amount of
$14,575,000 “set aside” from the Bank's ordinary
capital resources by the Board of Governors at its
second annual meeting.

The first capital contributions were received in
December 1968, consisting of $20 million from
Japan for the Agricultural Special Fund and $25
milion to be made available in five anaual instalments trom Canada for the Multi-Purpose Special
Fund, th 1969, contributions of $2 million were
received from Denmark, $20 million from Japan,
and $1,104,972 from the Netherlands, Japan's
contribution being for the Multi-Purpose Special
Fund and the contributions of Denmark and the
Netherlands being for the Agricultural Special Fund.
In 1970 Australia contributed $9,750,0003, Japan
§30 million, the Netherlands $1,104,972 and the
United Kingdom $14-4 million, all for the MultiPurpose Special Fund.

The following countries have contributed towards
the’ Technical Assistance Sposial Fund: Australia
$250,000; Canacia-$200,000; Denmark- $360,000;
Finland- $108,173; Federal Republic of Germany$86,137; India- $26,667; Japan- $1,813,982: Netherfands- $27,624; New Zealand- $168,000; Pakistan$42,000; Switzerland- $200,000; United Kingdom$118,434; United States- $1,250,000, 
As against total resourees of $142,025,961 in the
Special Funds (including an amount of $14,575,000
set aside from the Bank's ordinary capital resources),
$55,698,000 had been committed by 31 December
1970, leaving resources totalling $86,327,961 tar
future commitments.

There have been indications from several momhers of additional contributions to the Special
Funds resources ot the Bank. Japan has established
the praclice of making annua! contributions and
the increase in the size of its third contribution and
the growing liberalization of its ternis have been

3S?countries. The United States Government has
announced plans for renewed congressional action
in 1971 for a substantial contribution to the Special
Funds resources. There have also been indications
of new cornmilments from certain European countries.

The need for-augmenting the Bank's Special
Funds resources hardly requires claboration; but as
brought out in the Pearson Commission Report,
the quality of development aid is as important as
its volume. Mention was made in the Annual
Report for 1969 of the significant liberalization
which occurred that year in the bulk of Special
Funds contributions, Procurement conditions of
several contributions ware eased to allow procure
ment of goods and services to take place in davelopiag
member countries and also in several cases, in
other contributing countries.

This movement away from “tied” contributions
continued in 1970 and encourages the hope that
the goal of completely untied funds may eventually
be attained. In that connection, the countries which
took part in the meeting convened by the Development Assistance Commitiee of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Qevelopment in Tokyo
in September made it clear that there is growing
support in the capital exporting countries for “freeing”
their aid to the underdeveloped world from procurement restrictions.

Provision exists under the Special Funds Rules

cand Regulations for a considerable degree of

flexibility in the terms and conditions on which the
Bank may accept corlibutions to Special Funds
resources. While this flexibility has had its advantages
in the negotiation of offers, it is apparent with the
growth of operations that the administration of a
number of contributions with differing conditions
must becuine increasingly complicated. Full advartage of the growing liberalization of procurement
conditions may not materialize until greater unitormity
is achieved in the liberalized terms.

\ is recognized, of course, ihat in this matter
solutions have to be found which are acceptable
to all concerned and in line with (he interests of
the countries for whose benefit the funds are
administered. |t is also pertinent to note that if
contributions are sufficiently widespread throughout
the membership, the available sources ol supply
of goods and services are comimensurataly increased
and disadvantages of tied procurement may be
reduced. This points to the need for renewed
afforts to build up the Special Furds resources
not only to meat the increasing opportunities tar
conesssional lending but also to ensure that the

most efficient use can be made of the resources
available.

in a relatively brief period, the Bank’s Special
Operations have expanded both in size and range.
The rasources in the Multi: Purpose Special Fund and
the Agricultural Special Fund have been used io
finance such important areas of development as
agriculture, including irrigation and tishcries; electric
power; air and road transport; and vocational education. The pace of lending operations under this
category aiso gathered considerable momentum in
1970. The widening range of projects assisted by the
Bank’s Technical Assistance Special Fund has been:
of equally critical significance to developing member countries, Several of these technical assistance
projects have also been an Important source in feeding
the Bank's pipeline with sound loan applications,

The performance of the Bank in the field of
Special Operations clearly underlines the vital role
of Special Funds resources in meeting the pressing
needs of developing member countries and the
affective manner in which the Bank can utilize
such resources, !t is evident that unless the available
tesources are augmented on a substantial scale as
early as possible the rising tempo of Special
Operations cannot be sustained for long. The Bank
is confident that with the spirit of understanding
and cooperation that has throughout characterized
the establishment and growth of the organization,
the fiow of contributions to the Special Funds will
substantially increase in the coming years.

A. OPERATIONS

Ten loans tram Special Funds resources were
approved during the year involving a total commitment of $33-7 million spread over cight countries —
Aighanislan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Nepal, Singapure and the Republic of Viet-Nam.
The loans are summarized in the table on page 59
and descriptions of the projects are grven in the
country activities sections.

B. RESOURCES

In 1970 the Consolidated Special Funds of the
Bank were augmented by the equivalent of
$57,105,783 in cantributions received from Australia,
Cansda, Finland, India, Japan, Netherlands, Pakistan,
Switzerland and the United Kingdom, Total contributions lo Special Funds at the end ef the year!
amounted to $127,450,961 (see table on page 60).

1 Including commitments for subsequent years,The largest conttibution in 1970 was once
again that of Japan, which added a third instalment
of 10-8 billion yen {equivalent to $30 million) to
its capital contribution ta the Consolidated Special
Funds. This further contribution, which was effected
by an exchange of letiers in October 1970, was
allocated to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund. It is
available for use on the same liberalized terms as
apply to the second instalment, i.e, it may be used
for procurement in developed member countries
which are contributors to the Consolidated Special
Funds (other than the Technical Assistance Special
Fund) and in developing member countries.

There were three other contributions to the
Multi-Purpose Special Fund:

(i) In May the United Kingdom contributed six
million pounds sterling {equivalent to $14-4
million) for financing of the Bank's special
operations, other than technical assistance
operations on a non-reimbursable basis. The

(id)

member countries, of goods produced in and
services supplied trom the United Kingdom and
(b} in developing member countries and subject to certain limitations, in other countries
which have contributed to any Special Fund
of the Bank (other than the Technical
Assistance Special Fund) of goods produced
in and services supplied from such countries.
In July the Bank accepted a second contribution trom the Netherlands {the first having
besn to the Agricultural Special Fund), in an
amount of four million guilders, equivalent to
$1,104,972. The contribution may be used in
the Bank’s special operations, other than
technical assistance operations on a jonreimbursable basis, for financing the importation of goods and services (a) irom the
Netherlands and (b) from developing member
countries and, subject to certain limitations,
from other countries which have contributed

59(ii), in December Australia contributed an amount
in Australian dollars equivalent to $9,750,000
for financing of the Bank's special operations,
other than technical assistance operations on
@ non-reimbursable basis. The amount Is
payable in three annual instalments, Except
as otherwise agreed by Australia, the cen
tribution may be used for procurement in
Australia of goods produced in and services
supplied from Australia.

In all four of the contributions referred to,
income derived from the funds contributed, and
repayments of loans financed fram such funds, ave
tree from the procurement restrictions specified
ahove.

in November Denmark agreed with the Bank to
extend the use of its contribution, made in April
1969 to the Bank's Agricultural Special Fund, to
permit financing of procurement in developing

member countries of goods produced in such
countries.

Regarding the proposal (reported last year) of the
Netherlands Government to make a special contribution far the development of West Irian, arrangements ‘were put in hand for identification and
preparation of suitable projects in’ West Irian
Financing of such projects having been agreed to,
the Netherlands Governmem will make a special
contribution of 17:5 million guilders (equivalent to
54-8 million) to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund.

During the year, the Technical Assistance Special
Fund received the following contributions or arrangements for contributions.

(i) In June the Government of Japan contributed
the sum of 360 million yen (equivalenl to
$1 million) to be used by the Bank for procurement of the services of Japanese consuitants and specialists tor tectinical assistance

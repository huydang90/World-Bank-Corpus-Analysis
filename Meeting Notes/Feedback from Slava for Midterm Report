Good work.

Narrative is well developed. GitHub repo is clean and easy to navigate. 

Two main points:

1. Xiaoyan doesn't appear to be making code contributions to GitHub. From the commits I looked at they are either Thea or Huy. There needs to be a balanced contribution to the coding component of the project from all members.

2. I would urge you to be more ambitious with your project. It's fine and I can see you spent time with data. But end of the day linguistic diversity & readability measures are simple descriptive stats. So you should either build a statistical model where readability is just a parameter or build something from the other topics we cover in the course like dict/supervised/unsupervised methods. 

I want you to develop some additional advanced skills in the course of the project work.

Meeting 15.11.

1. Write Conclusion
  a. Finding: Based on the metrices the WB Annual Reports become more complex in the most recent decades
    i. World Development Report: low comlexity
    ii. The others have similar around 18-19 for the last decades 
  b. Comparing the WB reports with the other development institutions, this tendency is also evident there
  c. Cannot comment on the objective complexity of the reports because this would require human coding of the reports, which 
      is outside our scope and resources
      i. Tie it back to the original narrative from our literature review contributing to the literature with our method 
      deciding not to use human coders, which includes pros and cons e.g. not being as expensive but also not enabling 
      objective commentation
      
2. Read through the project again and make it more academic and take out the stuff we are unsure of 
  a. Adele will do the first read through with draft on conclusion
  b. Thea will do the second read through followed by Huy 

3. Sunday final meeting and submission around 18

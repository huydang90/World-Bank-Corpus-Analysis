Tasks to improve before submitting the mid-term:
Analysis & data works pretty well


1. We have some outliers that make the graph have big fluctuations e.g. 1958 suggesting that there is something wrong with 
the data + 1974 with few/many sentences 
  => have to figure out how to deal with that

2. We can add a few more matrixes 
  => take a look at the documentation for this (financial & technical data so it fits with our narrative)
  a) Find and add in new measures 3 or 4 more to give more weight to our analysis e.g. C 
  b) graph whatever we want after that

Main question then: 
3. Agree on preprocessing 

4. Write it up with the increasing complexity with the World Bank Corpus on Overleaf

5. Future work after the mid-term 
    a) Think about how to improve our project according to Slava's suggestions 

Next meeting at 15 Saturday 19.10.
Division of labor: 
    Adele & Thea work on preprocessing & Lexical diversity
    Huy works on experimentation and graph interpretation 
    We also need to talk about the data & fixing it

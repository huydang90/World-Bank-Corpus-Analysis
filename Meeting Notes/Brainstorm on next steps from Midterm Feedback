Brainstorm on Midterm feedback

1. Xiaoyan will upload more to GitHub 
2a. Building a statistical model where readability is just a parameter 
    i. Might be possible with the method that we'll learn next class for L5 and unsupervised methods
    ii. The wordscore method (https://tutorials.quanteda.io/machine-learning/wordscores/) predicting ideological positions of 
        political actors does not seem very relevant for our research question and hypothesis 
  b. ... or build something from the other topics we cover in the course like dict/supervised/unsupervised methods
    i. This is likely what we will learn in class 5.

3. I want you to develop some additional advanced skills in the course of the project work.

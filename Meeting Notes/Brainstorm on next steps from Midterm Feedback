Brainstorm on Midterm feedback

1. Xiaoyan will upload more to GitHub 

2a. Building a statistical model where readability is just a parameter 
    i. Might be possible with the method that we'll learn next class for L5 and unsupervised methods
    
    ii. The wordscore method (https://tutorials.quanteda.io/machine-learning/wordscores/) predicting ideological positions of 
        political actors does not seem very relevant for our research question and hypothesis 
        
    iii. Or use the director (or some other change) of the World Bank organizational set up to predict the ideological 
        direction or complexity of the World Bank Reports 
        => this would require finding speeches on the directors and match them to the time periods that they were the director
            and try to find the ideological impact, which might not be possible
            
    iv. Or look closer into the reports to e.g. compare reports on the same topic over time to detect changes in the 
        complexity of the writing
            
  b. ... or build something from the other topics we cover in the course like dict/supervised/unsupervised methods
    i. This is likely what we will learn in class 5.

3a. I want you to develop some additional advanced skills in the course of the project work
    b. Slava underlined us going in depth instead of just applying many different tools

4. NEXT STEP
    a. Think more about what to do 
    b. Next meeting online Wednesday 30.10. at 14.00

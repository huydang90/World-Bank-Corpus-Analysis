Meeting 30.10. Notes

1. Suggestions: 
  a) Topic modelling for next session but still a little unclear about how to do
  b) Discourse analysis of the individual documents; might reveal interesting aspects. Similar to topic modelling but more detailed
  c) Ideology classification like last time similar to word scores but might reveal ideologies of the reports
  d) Group of words that appear together (bi- and trigrams); related to complexity
  e) Supervised model but still a big unclear about how to do it 

2. Points to this:
  a) might be interesting looking specifically on e.g. Africa and looking at how the discourse for this changes
  b) Might also be interesting
  c) Concerned for ideology mapping as not exactly in line with our research question 

3. Course of action: 
  a) Divide workload and explore options
  b) For the next two weeks, look into other bodies of texts and look at complexity levels here e.g. world development research,
  African or Asian development bank or UN that are not under the World Bank 
  => to get a clearer idea of how they are similar or different to the World Bank and see if the different trends affect each 
  other or happen independently
  c) Potentially use the supervised method

4. Adele suggestion of how the language develops becoming more or less similar

5. Division of work
  a) Huy: World development report - policies in the developing world; about 30 documents
  b) Adele collects and runs code on: Annual reports from the Asian development bank established in 1966 (10 years after the World Bank): 
        https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adb.org%2Fdocuments%2Fseries%2Fadb-annual-reports%3Fpage%3D7%26fbclid%3DIwAR2MQiGalEVGrIVZGkrm7k-g_TL6fbswyIr3riEqC5vadaukN3KV0nTJPfQ&h=AT1KiVEeGsPOD75I7NUvz4ceRgCphBaBSnnahwEiCSi9Z6-zRo6QWgZmFHce8oHSwW9iU1VR8kf1DLVivubizWLNgQO77qAhf5kpDbz3Ur-l_CRwpY9wc9tRXoTCuYUme-KbHZvG
  c) Thea collects and runs code on: African development bank from 1964: https://www.afdb.org/en/documents-publications/annual-report
  d) Collec the documents by this weekend and run analysis 
  e) Apply other approaches after this week 
  f) Adele would like to do the coding for the complexity and similarity 
  g) Huy will make folders for the reports for us to upload the pdfs to and will do the conversion from pdf
  h) Adele will also do similiarity code

Note: Totals may not add due to rounding. The data on official grants and concessional loans in this table are not comparable
with those in Table 7. Table 7 shows disbursements by donor countries for all purposes; Table 8 shows receipts of medium-
and long-term capital by developing countries. The principal d ifferences are that Table 7 covers technical assistance and con-
tributions to multilateral institutions, including paid-in capital. The latter is the basis of multilateral lending at market terms.
The data on official grants and concessional loans in Table 8 do not include technical assistance, and they include the dis-
bursements of concessional loans from multilateral institutions.

World Development Report, 1979 is the second of a series of annual World Bank reports
designed to present a continuing assessment of development problems. Its coverage comple-
ments that of World Development Report, 1978, which evaluated the development record of
the last twenty-five years and examined the development problems and prospects of the Low
Income countries. This year's Report pays special attention to issues of structural transforma-
tion that are particularly important for the Middle Income developing countries. In dealing
with the appropriate policies to be associated with structural changes, it analyzes the processes
of industrialization, urbanization, and the sectoral deployment of labor.
The Report presents projections of developments in the world economy through 1990 and
identifies and analyzes four major challenges for policy:
  Creation of an international environment that is supportive of trade, capital flows, and
  energy development for the benefit of developing and industrialized countries alike
  Creation of job opportunities for the additional half-billion people who will join the labor
  force in the developing countries by the year 2000
  Accommodation of an additional 1 billion people in socially acceptable and economically
  productive conditions in the urban areas of the developing countries during the same
  period of time
  Significant steps toward the elimination of absolute poverty

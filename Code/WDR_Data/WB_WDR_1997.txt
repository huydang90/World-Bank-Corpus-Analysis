        This Report has been prepared by a team led by Ajay Chhibber and comprising Simon Commander, Alison
     Evans, Harald Fuhr, Cheikh Kane, Chad Leechor, Brian Levy, Sanjay Pradhan, and Beatrice Weder. Valuable
     contributions were made by Jean-Paul Azam, Ed Campos, Hamid Davoodi, Kathleen Newland, Kenichi Ohno,
     Dani Rodrik, Susan Rose-Ackerman, Astri Suhrke, and Douglas Webb. The team was assisted by Ritu Basu,
     Gregory Kisunko, Une Lee, Claudia Sepulveda, and Adam Michael Smith. Stephanie Flanders was the principal
     editor. The work was carried out under the general direction of the late Michael Bruno, Lyn Squire, and
     Joseph Stiglitz.
        The team received useful advice from a distinguished panel of external experts comprising Masahiko Aoki,
     Ela Bhatt, Kwesi Botchwey, Peter Evans, Atul Kohli, Klaus Konig, Seymour Martin Lipset, Douglass North,
     Emma Rothschild, Graham Scott, and Vito Tanzi.
        Many others inside and outside the World Bank provided helpful comments, wrote background papers and
     other contributions, and participated in consultation meetings. These contributors and participants are listed in
     the Bibliographical Note. The International Economics Department contributed to the data appendix and was
     responsible for the Selected World Development Indicators.
        The production staff of the Report included Amy Brooks, Valerie Chisholm, Kathryn Kline Dahi, Joyce
     Gates, Stephanie Gerard, Jeffrey N, Lecksell, and Michael Treadway. Rebecca Sugui served as executive assistant
     to the team, and Daniel Atchison, Elizabete de Lima, Michael Geller, and Thomas Zorab as staff assistants. Maria
     Ameal served as administrative officer.

       This Report is dedicated to the memory of Michael Bruno, Senior Vice President and Chief Economist of the
     World Bank from 1993 to 1996, whose life's work, including his contributions to this and past editions of World
     Development Report, immeasurably advanced our understanding of development.

 HROUGHOUT HISTORY, NOTIONS OF THE STATE'S ROLE HAVE SHIFTED DRAMAT-

ically. For m; of this century people looked to government to do morein
some cases a great deal more. But during the past fifteen years the pendulum
has been swinging again, forcing the world to look at government from a range
of conflicting perspectives. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of
command-and-control economies, the fiscal crises of welfare states, the dra-
matic succes! of some East Asian countries in accelerating economic growth
and reducing poverty, and the crisis of failed states in parts of Africa and else-
whereall of these have challenged existing conceptions of the state's place in
the world and its potential contribution to human welfare
    Governments are also having to respond to the rapid diffusion of technol-
ogy, growing demographic pressures, increased environmental concerns, greater
global integration of markets, and a shift to more democratic forms of govern-
ment. And amid all these pressures remain the formidableand persistent
challenges of reducing poverty and fostering sustainable development.
    It is not surprising, then, that countries are again putting the state under
scrutiny, asking what government's role ought to be and, critically, how that role
should be played. This Report explores why and how some states have
18 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 1997




   been more effective than others at playing a catalytic and sustainable role in
   economic development and the eradication of poverty This part of the Report
   provides a broad historical and conceptual introduction to the issues (in Chap-
   ter 1) and examines the empirical evidence of the impact of state policies and
   institutions on development (in Chapter 2). It conveys three principal messages:

   I   Developmenteconomic, social, and sustainablewithout an effective state
       is impossible. It is increasingly recognized that an effective statenot a min-
       imal oneis central to economic and social development, but more as part-
       ner and facilitator than as director. States should work to complement mar-
       kets, not replace them.
   I A rich body of evidence shows the importance of good economic policies
       (including the promotion of macroeconomic stability), well-developed
       human capital, and openness to the world economy for broad-based,
       sustainable growth and the reduction of poverty. But as our understanding
       of the ingredients of development improves, a deeper set of questions
       emerges why have some societies pursued these actions with greater success
       than others, and how, precisely, did the state contribute to these differing
       outcomes?
   I The historical record suggests the importance of building on the relative
       strengths of the market, the state, and civil society to improve the state's
       effectiveness This suggests a two-part strategy of matching the role of the
       state to its capability, and then improving that capability These are the sub-
       ject, respectively, of Parts Two and Three.

   of the economy by attempting complex strategic interventions in industry that
   are beyond their institutional capabilities Deregulation, privatization, and less
   demanding approaches to regulation and industrial support in these circum-
   stances will deliver large and immediate payoffs.
       These chapters carry four basic messages for policymakers:

   a States at all levels of institutional capability should respect, nurture, and take
     advantage of private and voluntary initiative and competitive markets.
     States with weak institutional capabilities should focus on providing the
     pure public goods and services that markets cannot provide (and that vol-
     untary collective initiatives underprovide), as well as goods and services with
     large positive externalities, such as property rights, safe water, roads, and
     basic education.
     Credibility is vital for success States with weak institutional capabilities
     should also focus on the tools for policymaking and implementation that

the Report discusses how this can be achieved.
    State capabil1trefers to the ability of the state to undertake collective actions
at least cost to society. This notion of capability encompasses the administrative
or technical capacity of state officials, but it is much broader than that. It also
includes the deeper, institutional mechanisms that give politicians and civil ser-
vants the flexibility, rules, and restraints to enable them to act in the collective
interest
    Three interrelated sets of institutional mechanisms can help create incentives
that will strengthen the state's capability. These mechanisms aim to:

   ther state officials nor anyone else in society is above the law.
       But rule-based government is not enough. State capability will also be
   improved by institutional arrangements that foster partnerships with, and provide
   competitive pressures from, actors both outside and within the state. Partnerships
   with and participation in state activities by external stakeholdersbusinesses and
   civil societycan build credibility and consensus and supplement low state capa-
   bility Partnerships within the state can build commitment and loyalty on the part
   of government workers and reduce the costs of achieving shared goals.
       The flip side of partnership is competitive pressurefrom markets and civil
   society and within the state itself. Such pressure can improve incentives for per-
   formance and check the abuse of the state's monopoly in policymaking and service
   delivery. Similarly, competitive or merit-based recruitment and promotion are
   crucial for building a capable bureaucracy.
        This part of the Report starts with a look at ways to reinvigorate state insti-
   tutions, by building the foundations of an effective public sector (Chapter 5) and,
   more broadly, by instituting formal checks and balances and controlling corrup-
   tion (Chapter 6). Chapter 7 then examines how to sharpen competitive pressure,
   strengthen voice, and promote partnership by bringing the state closer to the peo-
  plean important means of which is decentralization, or the shifting of power
   and resources to lower levels of government. Finally, Chapter 8 discusses partner-
  ships and competitive pressures that cross the boundaries of nation-states, and
  how countries can cooperate in providing collective goods.

Institutional mechanisms to improve delivery
Governments are experimenting with a range of institu-
tional mechanisms to improve service delivery. Greater use
of markets is creating competitive pressures and more exit
optionsalternatives to public provision for users seek-

options is the practice of contracting out service delivery to
private firms or NGOs. Some governments are setting up
performance-based agencies in the public sector and enter-

     Most countries have adopted one of two broad ap-              driven approach to civil service recruitment. The U.S.
     proaches to meritocratic recruitment. The first, called       system, for example, in stark contrast to the mandarin

For this map, economies are classified by income group, as they are for the tables that follow.                                                                                                                                                                      Middle-income economies
Low-income economies are those with a GNP per capita of $765 or less in 1995; middle-income,
$766$9,385; high-income, $9,386 or more. Five middle-income economiesAmerican Samoa (US),                                                                                                                                                                            High-income economies

Notes:
  Latest population census shows the most recent year in which a census was conducted.
 Latest household or demographic survey gives information on the surveys used in compiling household and demographic data.
 PAPCHILD is the Pan Arab Project for Child Development; DHS is Demographic and Health Survey; WFS is World Fertility
 Study; LSMS is Living Standards Measurement Study; SDA is Social Dimensions of Adjustment; CDC is Centers for Disease Con-
 trol and Prevention; and SHEHEA is Survey of Household Expenditure and Household Economic Activities.
  Vital registration complete identifies countries judged to have complete registries of vital statistics (v') by the United Nations Depart-
 ment of Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis, Statistical Division, and reported in Population and Vital Statistics
  Reports. Countries with complete vital statistics registries may have more accurate and more timely demographic indicators.
  Latest water withdrawal survey refers to the most recent year for which data have been compiled from a variety of sources.
  Fiscal year end is the date of the end of the fiscal year for the central government. Fiscal years for other levels of government and the
  reporting years for statistical surveys may differ, but if a country is designated as a fiscal year reporter in the following column, the
  date shown is the end of its national accounts reporting period.
  National accounts base year is the year used as the base period for constant price calculations in the country's national accounts. Price
  indexes derived from national accounts aggregates, such as the GDP deflator, express the price level relative to prices in the base year.
  Constant price data reported in the World Bank are partially rebased to a common 1987 base year.
  National accounts price valuation shows whether value added in the national accounts is reported at basic or producers' prices (VAB)
  or at purchasers' prices (yAP). Purchasers' prices include the value of taxes levied on value added and collected from consumers and
  thus tend to overstate the actual value added in production.
  Government finance accounting concept describes the accounting basis for reporting central government financial data. For most coun-
  tries government finance data have been consolidated (C) into one set of accounts capturing all fiscal activities of the central govern-
  ment. Budgetary central government accounts (B) exclude central government units.

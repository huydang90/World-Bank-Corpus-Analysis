a. “No+? indicates that, although the legislature is elected, a nominated executive head (for example, a mayor or governor) holds significant powers. b. State, province,
region, department, or other elected entity between the local and the national government. c. Municipality or equivalent. d. Subnational fiscal data come from World Bank
country data and staff calculations. e. The 1996 Local Government Commission recommended a four-tier subnational government system composed (from the bottom up)
of approximately 85,000 villages; 4,633 unions, and municipalities; 460 thanas and upazilas; and 64 zilas. Parliament has passed the upazila council bill, and elections are
scheduled for 1999; the zila council bill had not been passed as of June 1999. Elected local government currently exists only at the municipal level, composed of 4,500
union parishads in rural areas, 129 pourashavas, or smaller municipalities, and 4 city corporations. f. A law passed in 1998 allows for elections at the commune level, but
elections have not yet taken place. g. Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided into a federation and the Republika Srpska, with two substate levels within the federation
(10 cantons and 73 municipalities), but only one in the Republika Srpska (64 municipalities). h. Local elections are planned for late 1999 or early 2000. A law is being
drafted to define the powers and responsibilities of elected commune councils. i. Heads of local government are currently appointed, although this is slated to change in
1999. j. Villages elect representatives, who represent them at the district level and in turn elect a provincial parliament. The provincial governor is appointed by the head of
state. Eritrea is in the process of changing its constitution, which could modify this system. k. Local government consists of 3,609 urban local bodies and, in rural areas,
474 zila parishads, which wield some authority over the 5,906 panchayats samithis, which in turn have some authority over the 227,698 gram panchayats. It is therefore not
strictly correct to aggregate these into one level of local authority. l. A 1998 revision of the constitution allows for six provinces and an unspecified number of regions, in
addition to the existing municipalities. Only the municipalities currently have sitting elected governments. m. Malawi has a local government administration, but no elected
local government has been in place for several years. Local elections are expected in October 1999. n. Local elections have been held infrequently, and local governments are
established by provincial governments. o. The three tiers are the 16 gminas, 368 powiats, and 2,365 municipalities. p. Portugal also has 4,207 submunicipalities as a second
tier of elected local government. q. At the intermediate level the country is divided into 26 states, some of which have elected governors, whereas others have nominated
governors. r. The assemblies of the oblasts (provinces) and rains (districts) are elected, but their heads are nominated by the president. At the jamoat, or community, level,
the local governing authority is elected at a general meeting of the residents. s. Thailand currently has elected municipal governments governing 149 cities. In addition there
are 1,050 sanitary districts, which provide services in densely populated areas outside cities. Each is governed by a board composed of appointed and elected members;
983 of these districts will soon be upgraded to municipality status. There are up to 7,823 tambon administrative organizations, which provide basic services in rural areas
and are governed by elected assemblies and appointed executives. The 1997 constitution mandates that executives and councils of local authorities be largely elected. These
changes are expected to be completed by October 1999, in which case the country would still have only one tier of elected local government but close to 8,955 fully elected
local governments. t. Not all mayors are elected; about 10 are appointed. u. Appointed khokims (governors or mayors) exercise almost unlimited power in oblasts and rayons,
with quasi-elected councils having very limited authority.

                                       lobalization and localization—the integration of the world
                                       economy and the increasing demand for local autonomy—are
                                       two of the most important forces shaping development as we
                                       enter the 21st century. These forces will affect trade, capital
                                       ﬂows, the global environment, decentralization, and urban
                                       development, and will require countries to seek a dynamic
                                       equilibrium at both international and subnational levels.

                                       This 22nd edition of the World Development Report analyzes
                                       how these forces could reshape the international landscape
                                       in the new millennium. It proposes rules and structures on
                                       which to build a more effective, comprehensive approach to
                                       development; provides valuable insight into how current
                                       viewpoints can be adapted to ?t evolving development con-
                                       cerns; and offers guidance for decisionmakers, researchers,
                                       and others with an interest in development.

     This Report has been prepared by a team led by Gregory K. Ingram and comprising John Besant-Jones,
     Antonio Estache, Christine Kessides, Peter Lanjouw, Ashoka Mody, and Lant Pritchett. Valuable contri-
     butions and advice were provided by Esra Bennathan, Koji Kashiwaya, Miguel Kiguel, Lyn Squire, and
     Paulo Vieira Da Cunha. Assisting the team were Ritu Basu, Leslie Citroen, Marianne Fay, Christine
     Kerr, Kavita Mathur, Dambisa Moyo, and Sarbajit Sinha. The work was carried out under the general
     direction of Michael Bruno.
         Many others inside and outside the Bank provided helpful comments and contributions (see the
     Bibliographical note). The International Economics Department contributed to the data appendix and
     was responsible for the World Development Indicators. The production staff for the Report included
     Ann Beasley, Kathryn Kline Dahi, Stephanie Gerard, Audrey K. Heiligman, Cathe Kocak, Jeffrey N.
     Lecksell, Nancy Levine, Deirdre T. Murphy, Hugh Nees, Kathy Rosen, Walton Rosenquist, David
     Theis, and Michael Treadway. The support staff was headed by Rhoda Blade-Charest and then Rebecca
     Sugui and included Laitan Alli, Michael Geller, and Paul Holtz. Bruce Ross-Larson provided editorial
     advice and assistance. Trinidad S. Angeles served as administrative assistant. Anthony Rowley was
     the principal editor.
         Preparation of the Report was greatly aided by background papers and by contributions from par-
     ticipants in consultation meetings, both of which were supported in part by the Policy and Human Re-
     sources Development Fund financed by the Japanese government. The names of participants in the
     consultation meetings are listed in the Bibliographical note.

 4      Urban populations have better access to safe drinking water than rural populations 6

 1.1    Public infrastructure investment is a large fraction of both total and public investment in developing

 1.4    The rural-urban gap in access to power and water in developing countries narrowed over the past
          decade 27

Share of agriculture in GDP




Percent
      Less than 6
      6-9                  Share of agriculture in GDP is calculated by taking the
                           value added of an economy's agriculture sector and
      10-19                dividing it by gross domestic product. The shares say
                           nothing about absolute values of production. For
      20-29                economies with high levels of subsistence farming, the
      30 or more           share of agriculture in GDP is difficult to measure
                           because of difficulties in assigning subsistence farming
                           its appropriate value. For more details, see the technical

         THE WORLD BANK

ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTUREincluding transport, electric power, telecommunications,
water and sanitation, and waste disposalproduces services that are vital to development. The
availability of infrastructure has increased significantly in developing countries over recent
decades. Yet performance is often poor, inadequate maintenance leads to premature deteriora-
tion of facilities, and services frequently do not match users' needs and willingness to pay. The
potential for infrastructure services to contribute to poverty reduction and to environmental
improvement is often neglected. The time is ripe to broaden the focus of policy beyond increas-
ing the quantity of infrastructure facilities to improving the quality and efficiency of services.
  This seventeenth annual World Development Report examines the record of both successes and
failures in infrastructure provision and concludes that obtaining more effective and efficient
delivery of services requires important changes in incentives. The Report identifies three ways
of reforming institutions to improve incentives:
     Apply principles of commercial managementoperating infrastructure more like a busi-
ness than a bureaucracy, with clear objectives, with managerial and financial autonomy; and with
customer satisfaction a key measure of performance.
     Introduce competitiondirectly where feasible, indirectly where not. By giving users more
options, competition makes providers more efficient and more accountable to users.
     Give users and other stakeholders a strong voice and real responsibility in planning, oper-
ating, regulating, and financing services.
   Governments will need to act more often as facilitator, coordinator, and guardian of the pub-
lic interest (especially to ensure access for the poor)and less often as direct operator. The pri-
vate sector will need to provide management expertise and a significantly greater share of finance
than in the past. From a broad menu of specific institutional arrangements for infrastructure pro-
vision, the Report assesses four options by sector and type of country. The Report notes that
improved performance of infrastructure can enable countries to achieve substantial efficiency
gains, a higher level of service from existing infrastructure resources, and improved access to
essential services for the poor.
   This Report includes the World Development Indicators, which offer comprehensive, current
data on social and economic development in more than 200 countries and territories. The
Indicators are also available on diskette. An appendix to the Report provides selected statistics
on infrastructure.

     The government quickly took a range of measures
     aimed at curtailing demand and restoring financial sta-
     bility. It canceled or postponed several large public in-
     vestment projects in 1983 and saved about $10 billion of
     foreign exchange in the process; maintained an austere
     fiscal stance; devalued the rupiah by 28 percent; re-
     duced domestic subsidies on petroleum products; re-
     formed the financial sector to raise private domestic
     savings and increase investment efficiency; and re-
     formed the tax system to broaden the tax base and
     increase public savings.

Note: Real GDP growth is the sum of the contributions from total factor input growth and total factor productivity growth. The closer a point isto
the total factor productivity growth axis, the greater the relative contribution of productivity to real GDP growth. As one moves horizontally
toward the total factor input growth axis, the relative contribution of productivity to real GDP growth falls and that of factor inputs rises.

    Contributing factors were the recovery in international
    markets, the promotion of export processing zones,
    and the country's improved competitiveness after a de-
    valuation and a period of wage restraint. Zaire's deval-
    uation in 1983 and its subsequent move to a market-
    determined exchange rate have already provided a
    stimulus to exports. These reforms are to be followed
    by lower import tariffs and the abolition of all export
    duties and other taxes on manufactured exports. Fi-
    nally, Côte d 'Ivoire, Senegal, and Togo are rationalizing
    their tariff structures, Malawi is promoting exports
    through better duty rebate systems and improved ex-
    port credit and insurance facilities, and Burundi is elim-

Note: Column I gives an index expressing the actual labor required per unit of domestic value added in the countries listed for import-competing
and export industries. The index for import-competing industries in each country is set at 100. Columns 2, 3, and 4 show the potential increases in
labor coefficients attainable by eliminating: factor market distortions induced by domestic policies (column 2), the factor price effects of trade
policies (column 3), and the factor price effects of different levels of protection afforded to import substitution and export industries (column 4).
Column (5) indicates the potential labor coefficient obtainable by removing all distortions.

coverage ratios (the sum of the value of a country's import groups affected by NTBs divided by the total value of its imports of thesegroups) have
been computed using 1981 import trade weights. Computations have been made at the tariff-line level and results aggregated to relevant product
group levels. The data cover a broad range of NTBs, including pars-tariff measures (for example, variable levies, seasonal tariffs, and countervail-
ing and antidumping duties), quantitative restrictions (including prohibitions, quotas, nonautomatic licensing, state monopolies, voluntary
export restraints, and restraints under MFA and similar textile arrangements), import surveillance (including automatic licensing), and price
control measures. Standards to comply with health and technical regulations as well as excise taxes are not included because the data base
information coverage is not even for all countries. The industrial market economies covered are Austria, Canada, EC (excluding Portugal and
Spain), Finland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and the United States.

Groups of economies
  The colors on the map show what
  group a country has been placed in on
  the basis of its GNP per capita and, in
  some instances, its distinguishing eco-
  noniic characteristics. For example, all
  low-income economies, those with a
  GNP per capita of $400 and less (in
  1985), are colored yellow. The groups
  are the same as those used in the 33

 MANY FACTORS OTHER THAN TRADE POLICY affect the ability of a country to
 industrialize. Among them are its size, natural resources, and the skills of its
 people; the stability of its government and institutions and their ability to
 promote change; and the government's fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate
 policies. Yet the role played by foreign trade in the process of a country's
 industrialization, the theme of this tenth annual World Development Report, is
crucial, and empirical studies over the past thirty years make it possible to
draw useful lessons concerning the advantages and disadvantages of differ-
ent trade policies. The importance of the subject is magnified in today's
economic climate by the continued sluggish growth worldwide and the
rising protectionism in industrial countries. These factors threaten the pros-
pects of developing countries, many of which have begun to reduce their
trade barriers from very high levels to expand exports and obtain net earn-
ings of foreign exchange that are needed to maintain adequate growth and
to service external debt.
   The Report considers four principal sets of issues: LI What conditions in
the world economy support the industrialization efforts of the developing
countries? What factors will influence the growth of the global economy in
the long term? LI What is the role of government in bringing about efficient
industrialization? What are the effects of different trade strategies on indus-
trialization? LI How have countries accomplished reform of their trade and
other policies in such a way as to lead to efficient industrialization? How
should trade liberalization measures be coordinated with appropriate
macroeconomic policies in order for trade liberalization to have the desired
effects? LI How can developing countries respond to the growing pressure
on the governments of industrial countries to protect their domestic indus-
tries? What underlies the growing threat of protectionism in the face of clear
historical evidence that the consequences are damaging to all parties?
   Treatment of these issues, enriched by frequent comparisons of the expe-
riences of many countries, leads to consideration of the new multilateral
trade negotiationsthe Uruguay Roundthat have begun under the auspi-
ces of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Report discusses the
stake of the developing countries in these negotiations and the issues rele-
vant to their progress toward industrialization.

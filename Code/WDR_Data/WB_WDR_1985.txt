       This Report was prepared by a team led by Francis Colaco and comprising Alexander Fleming,
     James Hanson, Chandra Hardy, Keith Jay, John Johnson, Andrew Steer, Sweder van Wijnbergen, and
     K. Tanju Yurukoglu, assisted by Oliver Adler, Nadeem Burney, Sandra Gain, Shahrzad Gohari, Tina
     Jacobsen, Tani Maher, Hossein Ali Partoazam, Kesavan Pushpangadan, and James Rosen. The Eco-
     nomic Analysis and Projections Department, under the direction of Jean Baneth, supplied data for the
     Report. Enzo Grilli and Peter Miovic coordinated the work of the Economic Analysis and Projections
     Department on projections. Ramesh Chander, assisted by David Cieslikowski, supervised the prepa-
     ration of the World Development Indicators; Shaida Badiee was responsible for systems design. The
     authors would also like to thank staff from various parts of the Bank, as well as other contributors and
     reviewers. Thanks are also due to the production staff, especially Joyce Eisen, who designed the
     cover, Pensri Kimpitak, and Carol Cole Rosen. Special thanks go to the support staff, headed by
     Rhoda Blade-Charest and including Banjonglak Duangrat, Jaunianne Fawkes, Pamela Holmes,
     Carlina Jones, and Patricia Smith. The work was carried out under the general direction of Anne 0.
     Krueger and Costas Michalopoulos, with Rupert Pennant-Rea as principal editor.

       Definitional problems also arise over the treatment of
     inflation. If, for example, prices are rising at 10 percent a
     year, a debt of $100 will, after a year, have a real value of
     only $90. Inflation acts as a hidden capital levy on out-
     standing debt. Knowing this, lenders demand compen-

 Note: Debt is defined as medium- and long-term public and publicly guaranteed plus private nonguaranteed debt outstanding and disbursed.
 Short-term debt is not included. For the major borrowers, the inclusion of short-term debt would raise the external debt registered during
 1980-82 by about 30 percent. The debt service figures used are those for actual (not contractual) debt service paid during the period. Exports
 cover goods and total services. An asterisk indicates that the country rescheduled its debt between 1975 and 1984.

  Total credit consists of net domestic credit plus credit from foreign sources. Domestic credit can be subdivided into net claims on the public
sector (the central governments) and the private sector held by the monetary authorities and resident commercial banks. Net domestic credit is
defined as domestic credit less the foreign liabilities of the monetary authorities and resident commercial banks. These foreign liabilities, which
include long-term foreign borrowing by the public and private sectors as well as short-term liabilities of the domestic banking system, were
converted to local currency at end-of-year exchange rates and defined as credit from foreign sources.

countries, governments have tended to lower tar-

As a result, the direct investment that has taken
place has been geared more closely to the coun-

direct investment makes to development therefore
depends significantly on the policy framework in
which it takes place.

Note: The returns depicted are calculated as follows. Assume a U.S. investor has $100 to invest in an emerging market. After conversion to
domestic currency, the proceeds are placed in a basket of actively traded stocks. Dividends may be paid on the investment during the year, and
capital gains may also be secured if the market price of the stock rises. These two sources of income are converted back to U.S. dollars at yearend
exchange rates to yield a return denominated in U.S. dollars. This return is expressed as a percentage of the original $100 investment.
   Returns for 1983 are up to the end of November for Argentina and to the end of December for Brazil, Hong Kong, India, Jordan, Mexico,
Singapore, Thailand, and Zimbabwe.
   Based on preliminary data for 1983.
   Jordan's stock market opened in January 1978, hence data are not available for earlier years.
   Based on Capital International data for 1981-83, including net dividends.
   Based on Capital International data; January 1, 1976 100.
   Returns in emerging markets included in this table, except for Hong Kong and Singapore, on a market-weighted basis (1980 for 1975-80;
individual years for 1981-83); January 1, 1976 = 100.

Note: The table is based on a sample of ninety developing countries. The GDP deflator for industrial countries was used to deflate all items. Details
may not add to totals because of rounding. Net exports in this table exclude factor services and thus differ from those in Table 10.6. Net exports
plus interest does not equal the current account balance because of the omission of net workers' remittances, private transfers, and investment
income. The current account balance not financed by official transfers and loans is covered by direct foreign investment, other capital (including
short-term credit and errors and Omissions), and changes in reserves. Ratios are calculated using current price data.

Groups of economies
 The colors on the map show what
 group a country has been placed in on
 the basis of its GNP per capita and, in
 some instances, its distinguishing eco-
 nomic characteristics. For example, all
 low-income economies, those with a
 GNP per capita of less than $400 (in
 1983), are colored yellow. The groups
 are the same as those used in the 28
 tables that follow, and they include
 only the 126 countries with a popula-
 tion of more than 1 million.

World Development. Report 1985 focuses on the contribution that international capital makes to economic
 development The financial links between industrial and developing countries have become as inte
 gral to the world economy as trade has hitherto been This growing interdependence is a development
of profound significance The Report notes that recovery in industrial economies in 1983-84 policy
adjustments by many developing countries and flexibility by commercial banks in dealing with debt-
servicing difficulties have all helped to calm the atmosphere of crisis This does not mean however,
that the world economy has regained its momentum of the 1960s or that development is again making
rapid progress Growth has slowed in most developing countries that experienced debt-servicing
 difficulties and in many of those that did not Dozens of developing countries have lost a decade or
 more of development
   The experience of the past few years has raised many questions about the role of international
capital in economic development The Report examines these questions from a broad and long-term
perspective It emphasizes that international capital can promote global economic efficiency and can
allow deficit countries to strike the right balance between reducing their deficits and financing them
The availability of international capital also involves risks, however, that countries may borrow to
delay making needed policy reforms or may borrow too much if they misjudge the future course of
economic events
  The financial links between industrial and developing countries depend on three elements (a) the
policies of industrial countries (b) the policies of developing countries, and (c) the financial mecha-
nisins through which capital flows to developing countries The analysis of the Report includes all
three elements In doing so, it reveals a wide range of country experience and addresses the question
of why some countries have borrowed and encountered debt servicing difficulties while others have
not
  In reviewing prospects for the next five years the Report concludes that there are policy choices
available to governments that would contribute to faster and more stable growth for both industrial
and developing countries and to improved creditworthiness for every group of developing countries
For the industrial countries, the policy objectives are smaller budget deficits more flexible labor
markets, and freer trade The developing countries must continue policy reforms designed to restruc-
ture economies, ease debt-servicing burdens and restore economic growth These policies need to be
complemented by collaboration between debtors and creditors, including multiyear debt restruc-
turings, in the context of countries adjustment efforts
  The Report includes a statistical appendix and multicolor maps and graphics to supplement the text
The final portioh of the Report World Development Indicators, presents 28 two page tables con-
taining economic and social profiles of 126 countries

examms the current world economic situation and prospects as they relate to development and offers
a detailed analysis of a particular topic or sector of importance in economic and sociral development

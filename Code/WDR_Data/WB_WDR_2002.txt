This Report has been prepared by a team led by Roumeen Islam and comprising Arup Banerji, Robert Cull,
Asli Demirgüc-Kunt, Simeon Djankov, Alexander Dyck, Aart Kraay, Caralee McLiesh, Russell Pittman; and
Helena Tang, Nazmul Chaudhury, Jeffrey Hammer, Richard Messick, and Tatiana Nenova made additional
contributions. The team was assisted by Theodora Galabova, Paramjit Gill, Yifan Hu, Olga Ioffe, Claudio
Montenegro, Stefka Slavova, Mahesh Surendran, and LiHong Wang. Andrei Shleifer and Joseph E. Stiglitz
provided valuable suggestions during the writing of the Report. Bruce Ross-Larson is the editor of the
overview, chapter 1, and chapter 10. Andrew Balls provided editorial assistance. The work was carried out
under the general direction of Nicholas Stern.
   The team was advised by a panel of experts comprising Carl Anduri, Abhijit Banerjee, Kaushik Basu, Tim-
othy Besley, François Bourguignon, Antonio Estache, Cheryl Gray, Avner Greif, Nurul Islam, Emmanuel
Jimenez, Daniel Kaufmann, Michael Klein, Yingyi Qian, and Kenneth Sokoloff.
   Many others inside and outside the World Bank provided helpful comments and wrote background papers
and other contributions, and their names are listed in the bibliographical note. Much of the background re-
search was supported by a generous grant from the Dutch government. Research was also supported by the
Swiss Trust Fund. The World Bank Development Data Group contributed to the data appendix and was re-
sponsible for the Selected World Development Indicators.
   The team undertook a wide range of consultations for this Report, from the initial outline to the final
draft. During the Report’s planning stage in 2000, a February workshop in Berlin and a July workshop in
Washington, D.C. provided an exchange of ideas among academics and policymakers from around the world.
During the drafting stage in 2001, a consultative meeting on the media was held in April, and a consultative
meeting on judicial systems was held in May. In addition, the authors held consultations with a wider com-
munity that included nongovernmental organizations, holding meetings in Paris (with representatives from
the French Conseil d’ État, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the French De-
velopment Agency, and the Competition Council); in London (Department for International Development,
Overseas Development Institute, and nongovernmental organizations); and in Amsterdam (Amsterdam Insti-
tute for International Development). The team also conducted a series of videoconferences with audiences in
Bangladesh, Brazil, Egypt, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, South Africa, and Thailand. A consultation with the In-
ternational Confederation of Free Trade Unions was also held.
   Rebecca Sugui served as executive assistant to the team; Leila Search as program assistant and technical
support; and Shannon Hendrickson, Joanna Kata-Blackman, Mei-Ling Lavecchia, and Rudeewan Laohakit-
tikul as team assistants. Maria Ameal and later Eva Santo Domingo served as resource management assistant.
   Book design, editing, and production were coordinated by the Production Services Unit of the World
Bank’s Office of the Publisher.

FIRMS ARE KEY BUILDING BLOCKS OF MARKETS, PRODUCING GOODS

considers institutional issues for three groups of firms. Farmers are the focus of chapter

2, which looks at ways for agricultural producers in developing countries to increase

their productivity and reduce their risks through improving the institutions that gov-

ern the markets for land, credit, technology, and agricultural output. For firms, a key

institutional question is how to enhance investment and ensure good management;

chapter 3 covers the problems of Governance of Firms (focusing on those outside the

financial sector), through an examination of interactions between ownership structures

and legal frameworks, and public and private institutional players. In chapter 4, Finan-

cial Systems, which perform critical functions for market systems, are considered; the

chapter discusses the necessary institutional conditions for their development and the

role of the supervisory and regulatory system in ensuring a healthy financial system.

MANY OF THE INSTITUTIONS THAT SUPPORT MARKETS ARE PRO-

vided by the state. The ability of the state to provide these institutions—often referred

to as governance—is therefore fundamental to vibrant and broad-based markets. Chap-

ter 5 on Political Institutions and Governance discusses how political institutions shape

governance around the world by setting limits on the ability of the state to exercise its

power arbitrarily. This broad theme also runs through chapter 6 on The Judicial Sys-

tem, which examines the determinants of the efficiency of the judiciary and emphasizes

the importance of judicial accountability and independence from political pressures.

Chapter 7 on Competition stresses the central role of competitive pressures in creating

well-functioning markets, the institutions that support or undermine competition, and

the role of competition in spurring institutional change. Chapter 8 on Regulation of

Infrastructure takes up the interplay between competition and regulation in ensuring

that the market for infrastructure services operates fairly and is accessible to all.

This table classifies all World Bank member economies, and all other economies with populations of more than 30,000. Economies are divided among income groups accord-

upper middle income (UMC), $2,996–9,265; and high income, $9,266 or more.

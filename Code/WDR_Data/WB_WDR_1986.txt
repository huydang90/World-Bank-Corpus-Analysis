creation of an open trading system. This has

terventions are almost universal, and much trade
is managed by public sector agencies and market-        60                           Food exports

in agriculture.
  When domestic prices are kept below world
prices at country borders, producers of import-
competing products or of exports are taxed; simi-
larly, when domestic producers get prices that are
higher than border prices, they are supported. The
ratio of domestic prices to border pricesor the
nominal protection coefficient (NPC)is thus a
convenient indicator of policies that bear on trade.
  The pattern of policies followed by industrial         0

protection coefficients for food and nonfood crops        18                      Food trade balance

  After 1945, Japan continued to protect its agriculture,
but Korea, in its effort to industrialize, began to tax
farmers. The level of taxation, however, was modest
compared with the taxation rates in some low-income                  16
developing countries today. In the mid-1950s, domes-
tic producer prices in Korea were about 15 percent
lower than border prices. The level of protection in
Japan during the late 1950s was more than 40 percent.                 8
Since then, both countries have dramatically increased
agricultural protection. By 1965, Japan's level of farm
protection had risen to 76 percent, while Korea, in less
than two decades, had gone from taxing its farmers to                                r

        It is also sometimes thought that foreign producers                 70
      do not necessarily lose from nontariff barriers, espe-
      cially under so-called voluntary export restraints, since
      those who are able to sell despite the barriers receive
      higher prices. While the higher prices paid for imports
      represent a transfer to some foreign producers, non-
      tariff barriers reduce the volume of imports and
      thereby lead to losses in the total revenue received by
      foreign producers. In the case of clothing, for example,
      the transfer to foreign producers amounted to only
      one-tenth of their loss of revenue in 1980. Only in the
      case of steel in 1985 was the price increase large
      enough to offset the loss in export volume.
        Not only is protectionism very costly, it does not
      assist poorly paid workers. Indeed, it penalizes them.
      Import restraints are equivalent to a sales tax and often
      apply to necessities. When they do, they weigh heavi-
      est on those who spend proportionately more of their
      income on these items: the poor. The impact of such a

Note: The table is based on a sample of ninety developing countries. The GDP deflator for industrial countries was used to deflate all items.
Details may not add to totals because of rounding. Net exports in this table exclude factor services and thus differ from those in Table 3.5. Net
exports plus interest does not equal the current account balance because of the omission of net workers' remittances, private transfers, and
investment income. The current account balance not financed by official transfers and loans is covered by direct foreign investment, other capital
(including short-term credit and errors and omissions), and changes in reserves. Ratios are calculated using current price data.

Note: As explained in Chapter 4, efficiency gains are estimates of the increase in the net sum of producer and consumer gains and losses, adjusted
for tax revenue changes; they are not measures of the difference between the increases in export revenues and import costs. Results of further
work on a later period reported by Zietz and Valdes (1985) for sugar and beef indicate somewhat larger gains in export revenue than shown here.

Groups of economies
  The colors on the map show what
  group a country has been placed in on
  the basis of its GNP per capita and, in
  some instances, its distinguishing eco-
  nomic characteristics. For example, all
  low-income economies, those with a
  GNP per capita of less than $400 (in
  1984), are colored yellow. The groups
  are the same as those used in the 31
  tables that follow, and they include
  only the 128 countries with a popula-
  tion of more than I million.

      Low-income economies
      Middle-income oil importers
      Middle-income oil exporters
      High-income oil exporters
      Industrial market economies
      East European nonmarket economies

World Development Report 1986 examines trade and pricing policies in
world agriculture. Concern about these policies has arisen not only in the
many developing countries that depend heavily on agriculture, but also
in the industrial market economies whose farm support programs have
become very expensive.
  Policies in developing and industrial countries are examined in an inte-
grated framework that shows clearly the interdependence of domestic
agricultural policies throughout the world and the potential for large
gains from more liberal trade in agriculture. Restrictive trade policies in
industrial countries impose significant costs both on their own econo-
mies and on the economies of developing countries. At the same time,
many developing countries have followed macroeconomic and sectoral
policies that discriminate against growth in agriculture and in incomes in
rural areas, where poverty, hunger, and malnutrition are most strongly
concentrated. Overvalued exchange rates, heavy taxation of agricultural
exports and of import-competing food crops, ineffective and high-cost
producer support and price stabilization programs, inefficient parastatal
marketing, and excessive protection of manufacturing sectors have all
contributed to the discrimination against agriculture. Many developing
countries have acknowledged the negative effects of these programs and
have begun to implement policy reforms. For the world community as a
whole, liberalization of trade and domestic policies is a basic priority.
  The Report also reviews the hesitant nature of the recovery in the
world economy since the early 1980s and the serious difficulties that
many developing countries continue to face. Although the recent
declines in oil prices, real interest rates; and inflation will provide a
useful stimulus to the world economy as a whole, many highly indebted
developing countries, particularly oil exporters, will find it difficult to
maintain growth in the near term. The problems of economic adjustment
in sub-Saharan Africa are also far from resolution. Economic reforms in
both industrial and developing countries, as well as more liberal interna-
tional trade and greater net capital flows to developing countries, are
required to bring about sustained growth in the world economy.

     Note: Totals may not add due to rounding. The data on official grants and concessional loans in this table are not comparable
     with those in Table 22. Table 22 shows disbursements by donor countries for all purposes; Table 29 shows receipts of medium-
     and long-term capital by developing countries. The principal differences are that Table 22 covers technical assistance and
     contributions to multilateral institutions, including paid-in capital. The latter is the basis for multilateral lending at market
     terms. The data on official grants and concessional loans in Table 29 do not include technical assistance; they are net of the
     outflow of official grants from developing countries; and they include the disbursements of concessional loans from multila-
     teral institutions.

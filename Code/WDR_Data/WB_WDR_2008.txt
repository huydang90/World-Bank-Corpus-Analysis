Foreword


Agriculture is a vital development tool for achieving the Millennium Development Goal
that calls for halving by 2015 the share of people suffering from extreme poverty and hun-
ger. That is the overall message of this year's World Development Report (WDR), the 30th in
the series. Three out of every four poor people in developing countries live in rural areas,
and most of them depend directly or indirectly on agriculture for their livelihoods. This
Report provides guidance to governments and the international community on designing
and implementing agriculture-for-development agendas that can make a difference in the
lives of hundreds of millions of rural poor.
   The Report highlights two major regional challenges. In much of Sub-Saharan Africa,
agriculture is a strong option for spurring growth, overcoming poverty, and enhancing food
security. Agricultural productivity growth is vital for stimulating growth in other parts of
the economy. But accelerated growth requires a sharp productivity increase in smallholder
farming combined with more effective support to the millions coping as subsistence farm-
ers, many of them in remote areas. Recent improved performance holds promise, and this
Report identifies many emerging successes that can be scaled up.
   In Asia, overcoming widespread poverty requires confronting widening rural-urban
income disparities. Asia's fast-growing economies remain home to over 600 million rural
people living in extreme poverty, and despite massive rural-urban migration, rural poverty
will remain dominant for several more decades. For this reason, the WDR focuses on ways
to generate rural jobs by diversifying into labor-intensive, high-value agriculture linked to
a dynamic rural, nonfarm sector.
   In all regions, with rising land and water scarcity and the added pressures of a globalizing
world, the future of agriculture is intrinsically tied to better stewardship of natural resources.
With the right incentives and investments, agriculture's environmental footprint can be
lightened, and environmental services harnessed to protect watersheds and biodiversity.
   Today, rapidly expanding domestic and global markets; institutional innovations in
markets, finance, and collective action; and revolutions in biotechnology and information
technology all offer exciting opportunities to use agriculture to promote development. But
seizing these opportunities will require the political will to move forward with reforms that
improve the governance of agriculture.
   Ultimately, success will also depend on concerted action by the international develop-
ment community to confront the challenges ahead. We must level the playing field in inter-
national trade; provide global public goods, such as technologies for tropical food staples;
help developing countries address climate change; and overcome looming health pandem-
ics for plants, animals, and humans. At stake are the livelihoods of 900 million rural poor,
who also deserve to share the benefits of a sustainable and inclusive globalization.

This Report has been prepared by a core team led by Derek Byerlee and Alain de Janvry and
comprising Elisabeth Sadoulet, Robert Townsend, and Irina Klytchnikova. The team was
assisted by Harold Alderman, Beatriz Avalos-Sartorio, Julio Berdegué, Regina Birner, Lynn
Brown, Michael Carter, Luc Christiaensen, Marie-Helene Collion, Klaus Deininger, Peter
Hazell, Karen Macours, Michael Morris, Paula Savanti, and Dina Umali-Deininger, all of
whom drafted parts of the Report. The team was assisted as well by Noora Aberman, Jorge
Aguero, Shahrooz Badkoubei, Sarah Baird, Leandre Bassole, Benjamin Davis, Nango Dem-
bele, Ashok Gulati, Corinna Hawkes, Tidiane Kinda, Melissa Klink, Alex McCalla, Claudio
Montenegro, Stefano Pagiola, Eija Pehu, Catherine Ragasa, Antti Seelaff, and John Staatz.
   The work was conducted under the general guidance of François Bourguignon in collab-
oration with the Sustainable Development Network. Bruce Ross-Larson was the principal
editor. Extensive and excellent advice was received from Kym Anderson, Hans Binswanger,
Karen McConnell Brooks, Mark Cackler, Manuel Chiriboga, Kevin Cleaver, Christopher
Delgado, Shantayanan Devarajan, Josue Dione, Gershon Feder, Alan Harold Gelb, Ravi

opment Network of the World Bank, staff of RIMISP (Latin American Center for Rural
Development), and many others to whom the team is grateful without implication (see
page 266). Numerous others inside and outside the World Bank provided helpful com-
ments and inputs. The Development Data Group contributed to the data appendix and
was responsible for the Selected World Development Indicators.
   The team also acknowledges the generous support of the multidonor programmatic
trust fund (Knowledge for Change Program), the Canadian International Development
Agency, Ford Foundation, France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Global Donor Platform for

   The team benefited greatly from a wide range of consultations. Meetings and regional
workshops were held locally and in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan,
Kenya, Mali, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom; and discussions of the draft Report
were conducted online. The team wishes to thank the participants in these workshops,

Note: The contribution of agriculture to growth is defined as the agricultural growth rate times the sector average share over the
period divided by the GDP growth rate (computed from World Bank DDP 2006). Rural shares in poverty marked with a green circle
are from Ravallion, Chen, and Sangraula (2007), using the $2.15/day poverty line. Rural shares of poverty marked with an orange
diamond are predicted with an estimated regression of the rural share of poverty on rural share of population, agricultural share
in GDP, log of GDP per capita in 2000 US$ , and regional dummies. The dynamic paths are taken from Ravallion and Chen (2004) for
China; World Bank (2000b) for India; the United Nations' Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean; (http://www.
eclac.org) for Brazil; and the Central Bureau of Statistics (http://www.bps.go.id) for Indonesia, with poverty rates based on their
national poverty lines. Arrows show paths for Brazil, China, India, and Indonesia. The list of 3-letter country codes and the countries
they represent can be found on page xviii.

                                    in aggregate poverty reduction

Poverty rates in rural areas have declined over the past decade, mostly because of the impressive gains in China. But 75
percent of the world's poor still live in rural areas, and rural poverty rates remain stubbornly high in South Asia and Sub-
Saharan Africa. Rural poverty reduction contributed more than 45 percent to overall poverty reduction in 1993­2002, with
only a small share of that resulting from rural-urban migration. Rural-urban income gaps have narrowed in most regions
except Asia, where the widening gap is a source of political tensions and a motive for new efforts to stimulate agricultural
and rural development.

Biofuels offer a potential source of renewable energy and possible large new markets for agricultural producers. But few
current biofuels programs are economically viable, and most have social and environmental costs: upward pressure on food
prices, intensified competition for land and water, and possibly, deforestation. National biofuel strategies need to be based

                                    and food security?

Today, the world has more than enough food to feed everyone, yet 850 million are food insecure. Achieving food security
requires adequate food availability, access, and use. Agriculture plays a key role in providing (1) food availability globally
(and nationally and locally in some agriculture-based countries); (2) an important source of income to purchase food; and
(3) foods with high nutritional status.

Note: Six of the 15 countries are presented in the table above, selected to illustrate the different transmission magnitudes from terms of trade, to welfare, to poverty reduction across countries.
Of the 15 countries studied, 2 were estimated to experience an increase in poverty from agricultural trade liberalization in both developed and developing countries.

A dynamic private agribusiness sector linking farmers and consumers can be a major driver of growth in the agricultural and
the rural nonfarm sectors. But growing agribusiness concentration may reduce its efficiency and poverty reduction impacts.
A better investment climate for small and medium enterprises can improve competitiveness. Targeted public-private sector
partnerships and corporate social responsibility initiatives are instruments to promote smallholder participation.




A         gribusiness is the off-farm link in                  small, mostly in rural market towns, and                  competitive small and medium agroenter-

Transgenics, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs), are the result of transferring one or more genes, usually from a
wild species or a bacterium, to a crop plant. In 2006, farmers in 22 countries planted transgenic seeds on about 100 mil-
lion hectares, about 8 percent of the global crop area (figure E.1). Though transgenics have been taken up more rapidly in
commercial farming, they have considerable potential for improving the productivity of smallholder farming systems and
providing more nutritious foods to poor consumers in developing countries. However, the environmental, food safety, and
social risks of transgenics are controversial, and transparent and cost-effective regulatory systems that inspire public confi-
dence are needed to evaluate risks and benefits case by case.

                                    in agriculture
Climate change will have far-reaching consequences for agriculture that will disproportionately affect the poor. Greater
risks of crop failures and livestock deaths are already imposing economic losses and undermining food security and they are
likely to get far more severe as global warming continues. Adaptation measures are needed urgently to reduce the adverse
impacts of climate change, facilitated by concerted international action and strategic country planning. As a major source of
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, agriculture also has much untapped potential to reduce emissions through reduced defor-
estation and changes in land use and agricultural practices. But for this to be achieved, the current global carbon financing
mechanism needs to change.

The rural world is changing rapidly, and young people need to be prepared to rise to the new opportunities. Agriculture is
also changing, with new technologies, products, markets, and business environments. And many rural people will need to
become engaged in nonfarm activities or migrate to urban areas. To seize these opportunities, all will need skills that differ
from those of their parents--but education and training systems are not ready to face the challenge.

         focus H                    The two-way links between agriculture and health

Agriculture can pose major threats to health through increased incidence of malaria linked to irrigation, pesticide poison-
ing, and diseases transmissible from farm animals to humans in intensive livestock systems. And some of the developing
world's major health problems, such as AIDS and malaria, can have disastrous effects on agriculture, through the loss of
labor, knowledge, and assets. So coordinating agriculture and health interventions can yield significant welfare benefits for
the poor in developing countries.

I  n the 21st century, agriculture continues to be a fundamental instrument for sustainable
   development and poverty reduction. Three of every four poor people in developing
   countries live in rural areas--2.1 billion living on less than $2 a day and 880 million on
less than $1 a day--and most depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Given where they
are and what they do best, promoting agriculture is imperative for meeting the Millennium
Development Goal of halving poverty and hunger by 2015 and reducing poverty and
hunger for several decades thereafter. Agriculture alone will not be enough to massively
reduce poverty, but it is an essential component of effective development strategies for most
developing countries.

With the last World Development Report on agriculture completed 25 years ago, it is
necessary to redefine how agriculture can be used for development, taking account of the
vastly different context of opportunities and challenges that has emerged. To do this, the
Report--Agriculture for Development-- addresses three main questions:

· What can agriculture do for development? Agriculture has effectively served as a basis
  for growth and reduced poverty in many countries, but many more countries could
  benefit if governments and donors were to reverse years of policy neglect and remedy
  their underinvestment and misinvestment in agriculture.

· What are effective instruments in using agriculture for development? They include
  increasing the assets of poor households, making smallholders--and agriculture in
  general--more productive, and creating opportunities in the rural nonfarm economy
  that the rural poor can seize.

· How can agriculture-for-development agendas best be implemented? By designing
  policies and decision-making processes suited to each country's economic and social
  conditions, mobilizing political support, and improving the governance of agriculture.

This year's Report marks the 30th year the World Bank has been publishing the World
Development Report.

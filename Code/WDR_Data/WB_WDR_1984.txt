Note: The table is based on a sample of ninety developing countries. The GDP deflator for industrial countries was used to deflate all
items. Details may not add to totals because of rounding. Net exports plus interest does not equal the current account balance due to
omission of net workers' remittances, private transfers, and investment income. The current account balance not financed by official
transfers and loans is covered by direct foreign investment, other capital (including short-term credit and errors and omissions), and
changes in reserves. Ratios are calculated using current price data.

      Africa is often portrayed as an underpop-
      ulated region with vast acres of un-
      tapped land. It is true that its average
      population density is lowless than one-
      fifth of Asia's. But considering the rudi-
      mentary farming practices in most of
      Africa, some countries are becoming
  crowded, at least in the sense of limited
  food production potential. This is one of
  the main findings of the FAO's recently
  completed project, Land Resources for
  the Future.
    Of course, the goal of self-sufficiency
  in food production cannot be recom-

                         1982. Thus India, with more than 24
                         million births, appears as the largest
                         country, and China, with about 21
                         million births, is slightly smaller. The
                         colors represent each country's total
                         fertility rate, which corresponds to the
                         number of births a woman would
                         have if during her childbearing years
                         she were to bear children at each age
                         in accord with current age-specific fer-
                         tility rates.

 a GNP per capita of less than $410, are

World Development Report 1984 examines population change in developing countries and its
links with development. The Report shows why continuing rapid population growth on an
ever larger base is likely to mean a lower quality of life for millions of people. It concludes
that in some countries development may not be possible at all unless slower population
growth can be achieved soon, before higher real incomes would bring fertility down sponta-
neously. The Report outlines public policies to reduce fertility that are humane and afford-
able and that complement other development efforts, placing special emphasis on education
for women and increased family planning services. The successful experience of many
countries in implementing population policy, particularly in the past decade, shows how
much can be accomplished and how quickly.
  The Report also analyzes the underlying causes of the 1980-83 world economic recession,
concluding that its roots go back beyond the oil price rise of 1979-80 to rigidities being built
into economies from the mid-1960s onward. In reviewing prospects for the next decade, the
Report concludes that sustained recovery requires economic reforms in developed and
developing countries alike, as well as concerted international action to roll back protection-
ism and increase capital flowsboth commercial bank lending and, especially for low-
income countries, concessionai flows.
  A Population Data Supplement and multicolor maps and graphics supplement the text.
The final portion of the Report comprises "World Development Indicators," 28 two-page
tables containing economic and social profiles of 126 countries.
  World Development Report has been published annually by the World Bank since 1978. Each
edition examines the current world economic situation and prospects as they relate to
development and offers a detailed analysis of a particular topic or sector of importance in
economic and social development.

Foreword

Leaders, policy makers, and development professionals often worry that well-intentioned
policies designed to improve the lives of their communities will fail to deliver results.
     The global development community needs to move beyond asking “What is the right
policy?” and instead ask “What makes policies work to produce life-improving outcomes?”
The answer put forward in this year’s World Development Report is better governance—that
is, the ways in which governments, citizens, and communities engage to design and apply
policies.
     This Report is being launched at a time when global growth and productivity are con-
tinuing to slow, limiting the resources available to help the world’s poorest and most vulner-
able. Yet, people’s demands for services, infrastructure, and fair institutions are continuing
to rise. Given strained government budgets and development aid, it is vital that resources
be used as effectively as possible. We can do this by harnessing the finance and skills of pri-
vate businesses, working even more closely with civil society, and redoubling our efforts in
the fight against corruption, one of the biggest roadblocks to effective, lasting development.
     However, coordinating the efforts of this diverse set of groups requires clarity on the
roles and responsibilities of each group, along with effective rules of the road to reach and
sustain agreements. Without paying greater attention to stronger governance, the World
Bank Group’s goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity, as well as
the transformational vision of the United Nations’ broader Sustainable Development Goals,
will be out of reach.
     Based on extensive research and consultations conducted in many countries over the
past 24 months, this Report draws attention to the importance of commitment, coordina-
tion, and cooperation as the three core functions needed to ensure that policies yield their
desired outcomes. The Report also offers a helpful framework for approaching and resolv-
ing the challenges faced by our partners. Specifically, it explores how policies for security,
growth, and equity can be made more effective by addressing the underlying drivers of
governance.
     Moving beyond the traditional concerns about implementation, such as limited state
capacity, the Report then digs deeper to understand how individuals and groups with dif-
fering degrees of influence and power negotiate the choice of policies, the distribution of
resources, and the ways in which to change the rules themselves.
     As the Report shows, positive change is possible. Although reform efforts must be driven
by local constituencies, the international community can play an active role in supporting
these endeavors. In particular, we need to ensure that our future development assistance
fosters the fundamental dynamics that promote better, more sustainable development.

                        I hope the insights presented in this Report will help countries, their communities,
                     development institutions, and donors succeed in delivering on our shared vision to end
                     extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity.

are essential to the effectiveness of policies
 Function                                                     Examples of why these functions matter
 Commitment              •	 Decision makers may want to spend windfall revenues now instead of saving them for others to spend in
                            the future.
                         •	 Politicians may resist continuing policies that have been working and prefer to pursue others that are
                            associated with their political group.
                         •	 Public service providers may push to renegotiate the terms of their contracts to their benefit when they know
                            that the political cost of suspending service is high.
 Coordination            •	 Investment and innovation are induced when individuals believe others will also invest.
                         •	 Financial stability depends on beliefs about the credibility of policies; failures involve, for example,
                            bank runs, where everyone believes the rest will rush to withdraw deposits.
                         •	 Laws serve as a focal point for individuals to behave in certain ways, such as the convention of driving
                            on the right side of the road.
 Cooperation             •	 People have incentives to free-ride or to behave opportunistically—for example, by not paying taxes while
                            enjoying the public services that other (tax-paying) individuals are funding.
                         •	 Some actors potentially affected by policies may be excluded from their design, which weakens compliance
                            and leads to fragmentation.

  Note: The indicators for assessing the level of state presence are under-5 child mortality (health), share of literate adults (education), and share of
  households with access to piped water inside their homes (access to water). The degree of shading indicates the degree of coverage of services. The
  darker purple shading (panels a–c) represents a higher presence for that dimension (a better outcome or a higher coverage). State density (panel d) is
  the composite indicator of the different layers of state presence or coverage. The darker orange shading represents higher state density.

                   Note: In preparation for the World Development Report 2017, a series of lab experiments was carried out to explore the behavioral responses of agents
                   in terms of cooperation and redistribution under different protocols. In the basic lab game are three citizens and one policy maker. The citizens provide
                   resources for a group account, which the policy maker is in charge of distributing. The policy maker observes the total amount in the group account
                   and can then distribute the resources in any manner he or she sees fit. The game is repeated over 20 periods. In the “cheap talk” treatment, the policy
                   maker makes public the intended distribution rule prior to citizens’ contributions, but the rule is not binding and can be modified after citizens make their
                   contributions. In the “binding talk” treatment, the policy maker again makes public the distribution rule prior to citizens’ contributions, but in this case
                   the policy maker cannot amend the rule after citizens make their contributions. In this second case, there is a credible commitment because the public
                   announcement is binding.
                   Significance levels: ** = significantly higher earnings of citizens in binding talk compared with baseline ( p < .05), but not compared with cheap talk (and
                   cheap talk is not different from the baseline). *** = significantly lower earnings of policy makers in binding talk ( p < .01) relative to both the baseline and
                   cheap talk ( p < .01). Cheap talk is not significantly different from the baseline ( p = .133).

        Source: WDR 2017 team, using data from V-Dem, 2015.
        Note: The bars represent the average change in the relevant category for all “non-escapees” (beige) and “escapees” (blue) during the time a country is at the income level specified.
        Escapees are defined as those countries that reach the subsequent income levels during the sample period (1950–2011). Non-escapees are those that remain trapped at the same income
        level or move to a lower income level. All four panels use the same methodology. In panel a, public sector corruption (v2x_pubcorr) is an index ranging from 0 to 1, with 1 representing the
        most corruption. In panel b, judicial constraints on the executive (v2x_jucon) is an index ranging from 0 to 1, with 1 representing the greatest constraints. Government censorship of media
        (v2mecenefm) in panel c and CSO entry and exit (v2cseeorgs) in panel d are ordinal variables ranging from 0 to 4, with 4 representing the most accountability (that is, the least media
        censorship and the most CSO entry and exit). CSO = civil society organization.

 Note: In this figure, relative strength is measured on a 0–4 scale, ranging from 0 (no power to influence decision making) to 4 (group has a lot of
 power to influence decision making on many issues). Panel a shows the number of elite groups that have a relative strength of greater than 3. For more

The World Bank Group is committed to reducing its environmental footprint. In
support of this commitment, we leverage electronic publishing options and print-on-
demand technology, which is located in regional hubs worldwide. Together, these
initiatives enable print runs to be lowered and shipping distances decreased, resulting
in reduced paper consumption, chemical use, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste.
    We follow the recommended standards for paper use set by the Green Press
Initiative. The majority of our books are printed on Forest Stewardship Council
(FSC)–certified paper, with nearly all containing 50–100 percent recycled content.
The recycled fiber in our book paper is either unbleached or bleached using totally
chlorine-free (TCF), processed chlorine–free (PCF), or enhanced elemental chlorine–
free (EECF) processes.

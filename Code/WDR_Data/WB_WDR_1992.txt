      More than 1 billion people today live in abject poverty. The next generation will see the world's population rise
    by 3.7 billion, even if progress in reducing population growth accelerates. Most of these people will be born into
    poor families. Alleviating poverty is both morally imperative and essential for environmental sustainability.
      Economic growth is essential for sustained poverty reduction. But growth has often caused serious
    environmental damage. Fortunately, such adverse effects can be sharply reduced, and with effective policies and
    institutions, income growth will provide the resources for improved environmental management.
       The environmental mistakes of the past do not have to be repeated. Today, countries have more choices. They
    can choose policies and investments that encourage more efficient use of resources, substitution away from scarce
    resources, and the adoption of technologies and practices that do less environmental harm. Such changes will
    ensure that the improvements in human welfare which development brings are lasting.

                     Environmental priorities
                     for development

* Setting environmental priorities inevitably involves choices. Developing countries should give priority to
   addressing the risks to health and economic productivity associated with dirty water, inadequate sanitation, air
   pollution, and land degradation, which cause illness and death on an enormous scale.
      In poor countries:
         Diarrheal diseases that result from contaminated water kill about 2 million children and cause about 900
   million episodes of illness each year.
        Indoor air pollution from burning wood, charcoal, and dung endangers the health of 400 million to 700
   million people.
        Dust and soot in city air cause between 300,000 and 700,000 premature deaths a year.
        Soil erosion can cause annual economic losses ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 percent of GNP.
        A quarter of all irrigated land suffers from salinization.
        Tropical foreststhe primary source of livelihood for about 140 million peopleare being lost at a rate of 0.9
   percent annually.
     Concern over ozone depletion continues to grow. The consequences of loss of biodiversity and of greenhouse
   warming are less certain but are likely to extend far into the future and to be effectively irreversible.

     3          Markets, governments,
                and the environment


 Improved environmental management requires that businesses, households, farmers, and governments change
 the way they behave. Two sets of policies are required.
    First, policies should build on the positive links between development and environment. Policies that are bad
 for both growth and the environment should be eliminated: subsidies to energy, pesticides, water, and logging
 should be removed; rights to manage and own land, forests, and fisheries should be clarified; and pubu
 enterprises should be held accountable. Other development policies, such as promoting macroeconomic stability,
 improving the access of the poor to education and family planning services, and liberalizing trade and
 investment, will facilitate environmental protection.
    Second, targeted policies are needed to ensure that environmental values are properly reflected in economic
 activity by both the private and public sectors. The interventions that work best are those that combine incentive
 and regulatory policies, recognize administrative constraints, and are tailored to specific problems.

               Making better decisions: information,
               institutions, and participation


The principles of sound environmental poiiey do not conflict with development objectives. Why, then, are wise
policies frequently the exception? A principal reason is that such policies often mean the withdrawal of
entrenched "rights"to pollute or to use resourcesthat tend to benefit the wealthy and influential, often at the
expense of the poor. Effective governmental action is also hampered by incomplete information, uncertainty, and
 weak regulatory powers.
   In implementing change, governments must make the best use of their scarce administrative capacity. To do so
 requires, first, improved information and analysis to inform priority-setting and policy design; second,
 responsive and effective institutions suited to the administrative traditions of the particular country; and, third,
greater local participation in policymaking, monitoring, and enforcement. The benefits of public participation
frequently outweigh its costs.

      5            Sanitation and clean water

     For many people in developing countries water supply, sanitation, and solid wastes are the most important of all
     environmental problems. More than 2 million deaths from diarrhea alone could be avoided each year if all people
     had reasonable water and sanitation services. And large economic and environmental costs are incurred in trying
     to compensate for poor-quality services.
       This chapterargues that large gainsin environmental quality, health, equity, and direct economic returns
     can be realized by adopting an approach that comprises four key elements:
       Managing water resources better, taking account of economic efficiency and environmental sustainability
       Providing, at full cost, those 'private" services that people want and are willing to pay for (including water
 supply and the collection of human excreta, wastewater, and solid wastes)
       Using scarce public funds only for those services (specifically, treatment and disposal of human excreta,
 wastewater, and solid wastes) that provide wider communal benefits
       Developing flexible and responsive institutional mechanisms for providing these services, with a larger role
 for community organizations and the private sector.

         "Business as usual" scenario
         Scenario with accelerated investment in water supply and sanitation services a
         Scenario with accelerated investment and efficiency reformsb


 Note: Assumptions are as follows: growth of per capita income and population as in Chapter 1; per capita income elasticity, 0.3; price elasticity, -0.25;
 initial prices 60 percent of marginal costs, gradually rising to efficiency levels over a twenty-five-year period; initial supply costs 50 percent higher
 than with good practices (due to managerial inefficiencies), gradually being reduced in step with price efficiency reforms; and marginal costs rising
 at 3 percent per year.
    Investment in water supply increases 30 percent, and investment in sanitation services increases 50 percent over the period.
    To realize this scenario in low-income countries, efficiency reforms - and the resulting increase in investment shares - would need to be greater
 than average.

               Energy and industry


Without altered policies, pollution from fossil fuel generation of electric power will rise tenfold in the next forty
years, from vehicles more than fivefold, and from industrial emissions and wastes also more than fivefold as
demand for industrial goods multiplies.
   Low-waste and "clean" technologies and practices are capable of reducing local pollution levels appreciably as
output expands. Options are also emerging for reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the long term through the
use of renewable energy sources and through greater efficiency in energy production and use. To encourage the
adoption of such technologies, governments need to pursue policies that improve the efficiency with which energy
is used. These policies include the elimination of subsidies for power generation and, in many countries, for
vehicle fuels and coal. Efficiency reforms help reduce pollution while raising a country's economic output.
Policies designed to curb pollution directly, using economic incentives, laws, and regulations, are also necessary.

  7            Rural environmental policy

As the world's population grows by two-thirds over the next forty years, demands for food, fuel, and fiber will
rise enormously. Meeting these demands will require more intensive and extensive exploitation of many natural
resources, especially agricultural land, forests, water, and fisheries. The more that yields can be increased by
careful and sustainable management of those resources that are already in use, the easier it will be to resist     11
pressure to draw down new resourcesto drain wetlands, clear forests, and encroach on natural habitats.
   Three obstacles stand in the way of sensible resource management: failure to recognize scarcity in the natural
world, failure to ensure that the institutions managing natural resources are accountable, and failure to mobilize
knowledge for managing environmental problems.
   To overcome these obstacles, individuals must have access to knowledge and resources, (so that they can make
the right investments) and incentives, (to ensure that their activities do not impose costs on others).
Comm unally managed resources require a clear legal framework and supporting services. Governments must
devolve the responsibility for managing some resources to individuals, communities, and fiscally accountable
utilities. They need to make more use of pricing to allocate resources, to protect property rights, and to support
research and the dissemination of knowledge of sound environmental practices.

  Much more effort is needed to find scientifically
sound techniques for plantations and to learn how
natural forests work. Advances in farm forestry
and commercial logging have been slow, partly
because of inadequate research. In Asia (excluding
China) at least 5,000 scientists are working on rice
research but fewer than 1,000 on forestry. In India
expenditure on forestry research amounts to less
than 0.01 percent of the value of forest products
consumed each year.

forests, are difficult to manage even for the rela-

               International environmental concerns

 International environmental problems are more complicated to solve than national ones, for two reasons. First,
 no single authority can lay down and enforce appropriate policies. Second, solutions must accommodate large
 variations in the balance of benefits and costs to different countries. Some countries may have more pressing local
 problems and less money for solving them. To secure action, rich countries may sometimes need to pay poor ones.
   Given the large uncertainties surrounding the likely effects of greenhouse warming, a wise policy would
 include measures that both reduce emissions and improve economic performance (for example, the elimination of
 subsidies for fossil fuel consumption and deforestation); investments in more information to avoid the risks of
 costly over- or underreaction; precautionary measures to reduce emissions now at modest costs and bring down
 the costs of future reductions; and financial transfers to help developing countries broaden their technological
 options. More pragmatic international action is needed to protect biological diversity. Individual countries can do
 more to manage these resources in their own interests, but additional transfers will be needed to ensure as much
 conservation as the rest of the world would like.

9             The costs of a better environment



The costs of protecting and improving the environment appear at first sight to be large. Yet such investments
must and can be afforded. With good policies, the costs are modest in comparison with the potential gains from
improved efficiency and economic growth.
   Most investments will pay for themselves. But increased international support will be essential. Local
environmental concerns need to be better embedded in official assistance programs, and the close link between
environmental quality and poverty reduction warrants additional aid. Concessional funding for global problems
is required, but this should not be taken from aid budgets. Access to trade and capital markets in industrial
countries will be essential for a sustainable future.



                                                                                                      I

Numbers in parentheses denote the number of years of observations. Data have been presented only when they are available for four or more years. There are two methods for calculating
concentrations of suspended particulate matter: gravimetric measurement and the smoke stain method. These methods are not comparable. Because most air momtonng stations use the for-
mer method. only data derived from this method are presented. To masiinuze the number of cities for which data are presented. informatii,n is given on only two site types, though more
data than these may be available. Growth rates are calculated using the entire time-series available, although only part of that series may appear in the concentration data presented.

Share of agriculture in GDP




      Less than 6 percent
      6 - 9 percent         Share of agriculture in GDP is calculated by taking the
                            value added of an economy's agriculture sector and
      10- 19 percent        dividing it by gross domestic product. The shares say
                            nothing about absolute values of production. For
      20 - 29 percent       economies with high levels of subsistence farming, the
      30 percent or more    share of agriculture in GDP is difficult to measure
                            because of difficulties in assigning subsistence farming
                            its appropriate value. For more details, see the technical
      Data not available    note for Table 3.

            The World Bank



Between 1990 and 2030 the world's population will grow by 3.7 billion, demand for food
will almost double, and industrial output and energy use will probably triple world-
wide and increase sixfold in developing countries. Under current practices, the result
could be appalling environmental conditions in cities and countryside alike.
        This fifteenth annual World Development Report presents that outcome as a
clear possibility, but it also presents an alternative pathone that, if taken, would allow
the coming generation to witness improved environmental conditions accompanied by
rapid economic development and the virtual eradication of widespread poverty. This is
the more difficult path. Choosing it will require that both industrial and developing
countries seize the current moment of opportunity to reform policies, institutions, and
aid programs. A twofold strategy is required.
           First, take advantage of the positive links between economic efficiency, in-
come growth, and protection of the environment. This calls for accelerating programs for
reducing poverty, removing distortions that encourage the wasteful use of energy and
natural resources, clarifying property rights to encourage people and communities to
manage resources better, and expanding programs for education (especially for girls),
family planning services, sanitation and clean water, and agricultural extension, credit,
and research.
           Second, break the negative links between economic activity and the environ-
ment. The Report describes targeted measures that can bring dramatic improvements in
environmental quality at modest cost in investment and economic efficiency. To imple-
ment them will require overcoming the power of vested interests, building strong insti-
tutions, improving knowledge, encouraging more participatory decisionmaking, and
building a partnership of effort between industrial and developing countries.
         As in previous editions, this Report includes the World Development Indica-
tors, which give comprehensive, current data on social and economic development in
more than 180 countries and territories. These data will also be available on diskette for
use with personal computers.

About the cover


In almost every language there is a range of words related to
jobs, each emphasizing a different angle. Some words hint at
the nature of the activity being performed, evoking the skill or
expertise that is required. Others refer to the volume of human
inputs used in production, bringing images of effort and con-
veying a sense of physical exertion. There are also words asso-
ciated with the sheer numbers of people engaged in economic                                          Arabic Mapuche

    In many languages, words related to jobs serve not only as
common nouns but also as proper nouns. Throughout his-
tory family names have been associated with specific skills or
trades: Vankar in Hindi, Hattori in Japanese, Herrero in Span-
ish, or Mfundisi in Zulu, just to mention a few. The use of
job-related words as household identifiers shows that people
associated themselves with what they did. Nowadays, people aspire to choose their jobs based
on what motivates them and on what could make their lives more meaningful. In almost every
language there are also several words to express the lack of a job. Almost invariably these words
have a negative connotation, close in spirit to deprivation; at times they even carry an element
of stigma. In all these ways, language conveys the idea that jobs are more than what people
earn, or what they do at work: they are also part of who they are.

Foreword


Today, jobs are a critical concern across the globe—for policy makers, the business community,
and the billions of men and women striving to provide for their families.
    As the world struggles to emerge from the global crisis, some 200 million people—includ-
ing 75 million under the age of 25—are unemployed. Many millions more, most of them
women, find themselves shut out of the labor force altogether. Looking forward, over the next
15 years an additional 600 million new jobs will be needed to absorb burgeoning working-age
populations, mainly in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
    Meanwhile, almost half of all workers in developing countries are engaged in small-scale
farming or self-employment, jobs that typically do not come with a steady paycheck and ben-
efits. The problem for most poor people in these countries is not the lack of a job or too few
hours of work; many hold more than one job and work long hours. Yet, too often, they are not
earning enough to secure a better future for themselves and their children, and at times they
are working in unsafe conditions and without the protection of their basic rights.
    Jobs are instrumental to achieving economic and social development. Beyond their critical
importance for individual well-being, they lie at the heart of many broader societal objec-
tives, such as poverty reduction, economy-wide productivity growth, and social cohesion. The
development payoffs from jobs include acquiring skills, empowering women, and stabilizing
post-conflict societies. Jobs that contribute to these broader goals are valuable not only for
those who hold them but for society as a whole: they are good jobs for development.
    The World Development Report 2013 takes the centrality of jobs in the development pro-
cess as its starting point and challenges and reframes how we think about work. Adopting a
cross-sectoral and multidisciplinary approach, the Report looks at why some jobs do more for
development than others. The Report finds that the jobs with the greatest development payoffs
are those that make cities function better, connect the economy to global markets, protect the
environment, foster trust and civic engagement, or reduce poverty. Critically, these jobs are not
only found in the formal sector; depending on the country context, informal jobs can also be
transformational.
    Building on this framework, the Report tackles some of the most pressing questions policy
makers are asking right now: Should countries design their development strategies around
growth or focus on jobs? Are there situations where the focus should be on protecting jobs
as opposed to protecting workers? Which needs to come first in the development process—
creating jobs or building skills?
    The private sector is the key engine of job creation, accounting for 90 percent of all jobs in
the developing world. But governments play a vital role by ensuring that the conditions are in
place for strong private sector–led growth and by alleviating the constraints that hinder the
private sector from creating good jobs for development.
    The Report advances a three-stage approach to help governments meet these objectives.
First, policy fundamentals—including macroeconomic stability, an enabling business envi-
ronment, investments in human capital, and the rule of law—are essential for both growth and
job creation. Second, well-designed labor policies can help ensure that growth translates into
employment opportunities, but they need to be complemented by a broader approach to job
creation that looks beyond the labor market. Third, governments should strategically identify
                                                                                                     xiii

                       which jobs would do the most for development given their specific country context, and re-
                       move or offset the obstacles that prevent the private sector from creating more of those jobs.
                          In today’s global economy, the world of work is rapidly evolving. Demographic shifts, tech-
                       nological progress, and the lasting effects of the international financial crisis are reshaping the
                       employment landscape in countries around the world. Countries that successfully adapt to
                       these changes and meet their jobs challenges can achieve dramatic gains in living standards,
                       productivity growth, and more cohesive societies. Those that do not will miss out on the trans-
                       formational effects of economic and social development.
                          The World Development Report 2013 is an important contribution to our collective under-
                       standing of the role of jobs in development. Its insights will provide valuable guidance for the
                       World Bank Group as we collaborate with partners and clients to advance their jobs agendas.
                       Working together, we can foster job creation and maximize the development impact of jobs.

Note: Family composition indicates the change in the share of adults (ages 18 and older) within the household. Labor income refers to the change in employment and earnings for
each adult. Nonlabor income refers to changes in other sources of income such as transfers, pensions, and imputed housing rents. If a bar is located below the horizontal axis, it
means that that source would have increased, instead of decreased, poverty. The changes are computed for Argentina (2000–10); Bangladesh (2000–10); Brazil (2001–09); Chile
(2000–09); Colombia (2002–10); Costa Rica (2000–08); Ecuador (2003–10); El Salvador (2000-09); Ghana (1998–2005); Honduras (1999–2009); Mexico (2000–10); Moldova (2001–10);
Panama (2001–09); Paraguay (1999–2010); Peru (2002–10); Nepal (1996–2003); Romania (2001–09); and Thailand (2000–09). The changes for Bangladesh, Ghana, Moldova, Nepal,
Peru, Romania, and Thailand are computed using consumption-based measures of poverty, while the changes for the other countries are based on income measures.

from the International Labour Organization (ILO) October Inquiry database by calibrating the data into a normalized wage rate for each occupation. For a description of the data,

              Jobs and living standards

              Jobs are the main source of income for the majority of households and a
              key driver of poverty reduction. But their contribution to well-being goes
              beyond the earnings they provide.



              J    obs are the most important determinant
                   of living standards around the world. For
                   the vast majority of people, their work is the
              main source of income, especially in the poorest

      BOX 2.1     There are many dimensions of living standards and many ways to measure them

      Debates on how to define and measure living standards go far back                of standards of living and poverty reduction worldwide. Advances

Note: Family composition indicates the change in the share of adults (ages 18 and older) within the household. Labor income refers to the change in employment and earnings for
each adult. Nonlabor income refers to changes in other sources of income such as transfers, pensions, and imputed housing rents. If a bar is located below the horizontal axis, it
means that that source would have increased, instead of decreased, poverty. The changes are computed for Argentina (2000–10); Bangladesh (2000–10); Brazil (2001–09); Chile
(2000–09); Colombia (2002–10); Costa Rica (2000–08); Ecuador (2003–10); El Salvador (2000­09); Ghana (1998–2005); Honduras (1999–2009); Mexico (2000–10); Moldova (2001–10);
Panama (2001–09); Paraguay (1999–2010); Peru (2002–10); Nepal (1996–2003); Romania (2001–09); and Thailand (2000–09). The changes for Bangladesh, Ghana, Moldova, Nepal,
Peru, Romania, and Thailand are computed using consumption­based measures of poverty, while the changes for the other countries are based on income measures.

Note: The figure shows the decomposition of labor productivity growth in 81 economies over 1999–2008 into productivity changes due to changes within sectors and reallocation
across sectors. Seven sectors are considered: agriculture, hunting, forestry, and fishing; mining and utilities; manufacturing; construction; trade, restaurants, and hotels; transport,
storage, and communication; and other services. The regional growth rates are weighted averages, with weights based on an economy’s share in regional GDP.

and “political stability and the absence of violence” from the Worldwide Governance Indicators. “Index of civic engagement” is the average of responses to questions from the World
Values Survey on (a) active membership in associations; (b) whether the respondent participated or would participate in a demonstration; and (c) whether the respondent would
sign a petition.

Note: The analysis includes 54 countries. The vertical axis shows the marginal probability (d-probit coefficient) of individuals’ self-reported trust or civic engagement on being
unemployed. The estimates control for the income, education, and demographic characteristics of respondents. Trust is based on the question, “Generally speaking, would you say
that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?” Civic engagement variables are (a) whether the respondent is an active member of
one or more of nine different associations; (b) whether the respondent attended or would attend a demonstration; or (c) whether the respondent signed or would sign a petition.
The line indicates the 95 percent confidence interval of each coefficient. If the line crosses the horizontal axis, the corresponding coefficient is not statistically significant.

Note: The analysis includes 54 countries. The vertical axis shows the marginal probability (d-probit coefficient) of individuals’ self-reported trust or civic engagement on an index
assessing whether respondents think their job is cognitive, creative, or independent. The estimates control for the income, education, and demographic characteristics of the
respondents. Trust is based on responses to the question “Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with
people?” Civic engagement variables are whether the respondent is an active member of one or more of nine different associations and whether the respondent attended or
would attend a demonstration, or signed or would sign a petition. The line indicates the 95 percent confidence interval of each coefficient. If the line crosses the horizontal axis,
the corresponding coefficient is not statistically significant.

f. Estimating the indirect channel—the effect of circumstances through education—would be difficult because education depends on a host of factors other than the circum-
   stances on which information is available. Moreover, excluding the impact of circumstances through education is justified because we are interested in measuring the extent to
   which inequality in access to jobs is attributable to circumstances. While circumstances may have influenced educational attainment as well, these effects would have occurred
   at a much earlier stage of life (primarily in childhood) and therefore do not reflect inequality of opportunities specific to jobs.

              Jobs are often assessed from an individual perspective. But they can also
              affect the earnings, productivity, and well-being of others—positively
              or negatively. These spillovers should be assessed too.

Note: The figure shows the changes in the relative importance of skills obstacles between beginning and end of the 2000s. The relative skill obstacle is defined as the ratio between
(a) the share of firm managers saying that lack of skills is a major or severe obstacle and (b) the share of firm managers rating other constraints as major or severe. A positive score
indicates that the skills constraint became more severe relative to others.

      Industrial policy is an approach to state economic stewardship in                A second approach emphasizes the policy process and espe-

panels. The bars indicate differences in the rating of constraints between firms in two groups. Ratings in the surveys range from 1 (no constraint) to 5 (severe); they are net of the
average rating of constraints by each firm, to assess relative severity. The analysis controls for firm age, size, ownership structure, export orientation, industry, and year.

programs, and social insurance. But the main
constraints to the job creation often lie outside
the labor market, and a clear approach is needed
to support appropriate policy responses.

              Labor policies revisited

              Labor policies can address labor market imperfections. But interventions
              can hinder dynamism in some cases, while the lack of mechanisms for

country services trade restrictiveness index is a weighted average of a country’s policies or commitments to market access by foreigners in financial, retailing, telecommunication,
transportation and selected professional services sectors. Weights are sectoral gross domestic product shares. The regional index is a simple average of country indices.

Glossary


JOBS

Jobs: While precise definitions vary, jobs are labor activities that generate income, monetary or
in kind, without violating fundamental rights and principles at work. Jobs can take the form of
wage employment, self-employment, and farming. They can be formal or informal.

Good jobs for development: These are jobs that contribute the most to societal goals. The
development payoff of a job is the sum of the value it has to the worker and its spillovers (if
any) on others. The individual value is the first-order measure of the development payoff, but
spillovers can be substantial.

Jobs lens: Strategies, policies, and programs adopt a jobs lens if they take into account the
development payoffs from jobs. The jobs lens involves aims at realizing the untapped develop-
ment payoffs by addressing the constraints that prevent the private sector from creating more
good jobs for development.


SKILLS

Cognitive skills: They include verbal ability, working memory, numeracy, and problem-
solving abilities. They are the foundation for the acquisition and building of other skills
throughout life.

Social skills: They facilitate interaction and communication with others. They are based
on personality traits that underlie behaviors such as teamwork, reliability, discipline, or work
effort.

Technical skills: They enable the performance of specific tasks. They take the form of knowl-
edge that is specific to a particular occupation or group of occupations.

Entrepreneurship: It is the combination of innovative capacity to put new ideas into effect
with managerial capacity to increase a firm’s efficiency within the limits of known technology.


TRANSFORMATIONS

Living standards: They encompass the material and subjective aspects of well-being. Jobs con-
tribute to living standards through earnings opportunities that lift people out of poverty, make
them less vulnerable, motivate them, and contribute to their broader happiness and satisfac-
tion with life.


                                                                                                    329

                                   Productivity: It is the amount of output generated with a given amount of inputs. A higher
                                   productivity of individual jobs, the creation of more productive jobs and destruction of less
                                   productive ones, and the reallocation of workers within countries and across borders drive
                                   changes in aggregate productivity.

                                   Social cohesion: Societies are cohesive when they have the capacity to manage collective deci-
                                   sion making peacefully. Jobs can contribute to social cohesion by nurturing trust in others
                                   beyond the group people belong to. They can also do so by fostering civic engagement.


                                   RIGHTS

                                   Core labor standards: A set of eight International Labour Organization conventions included
                                   in the 1998 Declaration of the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. These conven-
                                   tions cover child labor, discrimination, forced labor, and freedom of association and collective
                                   bargaining.

                                   Health and safety at work: Occupational accidents and work-related diseases can undermine
                                   workers’ health, are an important source of mortality, and can have high costs to society.


                                   DEVELOPMENT PAYOFFS

                                   Spillovers: Beyond their direct impact on the well-being of the people who hold them, jobs
                                   can have additional impacts on societal goals. Jobs may influence the living standards of oth-
                                   ers, their productivity, or the way collective decisionmaking works. Spillovers from jobs can be
                                   positive or negative.

                                   Earnings of others: Uneven bargaining power or discrimination may lead to labor earnings
                                   that are too low or too high, with others gaining or losing as a result. Jobs supported through
                                   government transfers or restrictive regulations also affect the earnings and employment
                                   opportunities of others.

                                   Household allocations: Jobs can change the status of their jobholders and increase their say
                                   on how resources are allocated among household members. Jobs that empower women can
                                   lead to greater investments in children’s education and health.

                                   Poverty reduction: In societies that value poverty reduction, jobs that take people out of hard-
                                   ship increase overall well-being. In these societies, employment opportunities tilted in favor of
                                   the poor are seen as preferable, even if aggregate earnings or output do not change.

                                   Agglomeration effects: Work-related interactions can increase the productivity of others. The
                                   sharing of ideas; learning from customers, suppliers and competitors; and a better matching
                                   of skills across a larger pool of workers are among the mechanisms through which these pro-
                                   ductivity gains take place.

                                   Global integration: Jobs linked to world markets and jobs in foreign-owned companies al-
                                   low acquiring more advanced technical and managerial skills. These jobs can also change the
                                   industrial structure in ways that favor the most productive economic units and push the least
                                   productive out of business.

Environmental effects: Jobs have negative impacts on aggregate productivity when they dam-
age the environment or lead to an overuse of scarce resources. But they can also have positive
environmental effects, as in the case of jobs to manage forests and other common resources.

Social identity: Jobs can impact the well-being of others by influencing the values and be-
havior of those who hold them in ways that affect society at large. Jobs can shape the norms
influencing how the jobholder interacts with others.

Networks: Jobs connect people to each other. They convey information among coworkers and
society more broadly. Jobs may also contribute to tolerance when interactions at the workplace
increase direct knowledge among people of different social and ethnic backgrounds.

Sense of fairness: Job allocations at odds with the idea of equality of opportunity may lead
to frustration and disengagement from society and collective decision-making processes.
Jobs that live up to standards of transparency and merit can contribute to the sense of fairness
in society.


JOBS CHALLENGES

Agrarian economies: In these economies most people are still engaged in agriculture, often
in very small family farms, and cities are not yet a source of economic dynamism.

Conflict-affected countries: These are countries undergoing or emerging from conflict, where
peace-keeping forces may still be needed or where deaths from conflict may still be high.

Resource-rich countries: Minerals account for a large share of exports. Exploitation of re-
sources brings dramatic economic growth but undermines competitiveness and encourages
jobs based on transfers.

Small island nations: Their size and remoteness make it difficult for them to reap the benefits
of agglomeration and global integration. Their fragile ecosystems add to their vulnerability.

Urbanizing countries: The share of the urban population is growing rapidly. Cities are a
magnet for rural migrants but may fail to move up from exports of light manufacturing
to higher value added products.

Countries with high youth unemployment: Prolonged joblessness and idleness affect a large
share of the often sizeable youth population. The allocation of business opportunities and jobs
is tainted by privilege.

Formalizing countries: The coverage of social protection systems is large enough to envision
extending it to the entire workforce, but how to do it without undermining productivity is a
challenge.

Aging societies: The share of the working-age population is declining and the costs of pro-
viding and caring for the growing number of elderly is increasing, putting a double burden on
living standards.

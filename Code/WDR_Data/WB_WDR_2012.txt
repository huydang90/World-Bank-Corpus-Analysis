         tremendous progress has been made where lifting a single barrier—in

         Progress has been slower either where multiple barriers need to be lifted
         at the same time or where a single point of entry produces bottlenecks    141

Foreword


The lives of girls and women have changed dramatically over the past quarter century. Today,
more girls and women are literate than ever before, and in a third of developing countries,
there are more girls in school than boys. Women now make up over 40 percent of the global
labor force. Moreover, women live longer than men in all regions of the world. The pace of
change has been astonishing—indeed, in many developing countries, they have been faster
than the equivalent changes in developed countries: What took the United States 40 years to
achieve in increasing girls’ school enrollment has taken Morocco just a decade.
    In some areas, however, progress toward gender equality has been limited—even in devel-
oped countries. Girls and women who are poor, live in remote areas, are disabled, or belong
to minority groups continue to lag behind. Too many girls and women are still dying in child-
hood and in the reproductive ages. Women still fall behind in earnings and productivity, and
in the strength of their voices in society. In some areas, such as education, there is now a gen-
der gap to the disadvantage of men and boys.
    The main message of this year’s World Development Report: Gender Equality and Develop-
ment is that these patterns of progress and persistence in gender equality matter, both for
development outcomes and policy making. They matter because gender equality is a core
development objective in its own right. But greater gender equality is also smart economics,
enhancing productivity and improving other development outcomes, including prospects for
the next generation and for the quality of societal policies and institutions. Economic develop-
ment is not enough to shrink all gender disparities—corrective policies that focus on persist-
ing gender gaps are essential.
    This Report points to four priority areas for policy going forward. First, reducing gender
gaps in human capital—speci?cally those that address female mortality and education. Sec-
ond, closing gender gaps in access to economic opportunities, earnings, and productivity.
Third, shrinking gender differences in voice and agency within society. Fourth, limiting the
reproduction of gender inequality across generations. These are all areas where higher incomes
by themselves do little to reduce gender gaps, but focused policies can have a real impact.
    Public actions need to address the underlying determinants of gender gaps in each pri-
ority area—in some cases, improving service delivery (especially for clean water, sanitation,
and maternal care), for others, tackling constraints that originate in the workings of mar-
kets and institutions to limit progress (for example, in reducing gender gaps in earnings and
productivity).
    Development partners can complement public action. In each of the four priority areas,
efforts need more funding (particularly to support the poorest countries as they address
female mortality and gender gaps in education); better gender-disaggregated data; more
experimentation and systematic evaluation; and broader partnerships that include the private
sector, development agencies, and civil society organizations.


                                                                                                    xiii

          Gender equality is at the heart of development. It’s the right development objective, and
      it’s smart economic policy. The World Development Report 2012 can help both countries and
      international partners think through and integrate a focus on gender equality into develop-
      ment policy making and programming.

DATA NOTES
The countries included in regional and income groupings in this Report are listed in the
Classi?cation of Economies table at the end of the Selected World Development Indicators.
Income classi?cations are based on GNP per capita; thresholds for income classi?cations in
this edition may be found in the Introduction to Selected World Development Indicators.
Group averages reported in the ?gures and tables are unweighted averages of the countries in
the group, unless noted to the contrary.
   The use of the word countries to refer to economies implies no judgment by the World
Bank about the legal or other status of a territory. The term developing countries includes low-
and middle-income economies and thus may include economies in transition from central
planning, as a matter of convenience. The term advanced countries may be used as a matter of
convenience to denote high-income economies.

Note: Dollar ?gures are current U.S. dollars, unless otherwise speci?ed. Billion means 1,000
million; trillion means 1,000 billion.

Gender Equality and Development
Overview


   Baruani is reﬂecting on how women’s and men’s lives have changed over the past decade in
   Ijuhanyondo—a village in Tanzania. “Ten years back was terrible,? she recalls. “Women were very be-
   hind. They used to be only at home doing housework. But now, they are in businesses, they are in poli-
   tics.? Others hold similar views. “We do not depend a lot on men as it used to be,? says Agnetha. “We
   have some cash for ourselves, and this assists us in being free from men and to some extent controlling
   our lives.? In addition to managing their businesses, the women now make up half the members of the
   street committee that runs the village.

   Despite these positive changes, many challenges continue to weigh on women’s daily lives. Fewer than
   half the homes in the village have piped water. Even more dif?cult, Tungise and other women of the
   village still fear violence by their partners: “When they are drunk, they can begin beating up women and
   children in the house. The worst bit of it is forcing sex with you.? Although legally women can inherit
   land or a house, tradition prevails. “Yes, women can inherit property,? says Flora, the executive secretary
   of the street committee. “In fact, in the will the father is supposed to give each son and daughter some-
   thing, and nowadays the law is strict, equally. But still, men give to their sons and argue that women
   have the property of where they are married.?

      BOX 1     What do we mean by gender equality?

      Gender refers to the social, behavioral, and cultural attributes,                 that arise from circumstances beyond the control of individuals and
      expectations, and norms associated with being a woman or a man.                   those that stem from differences in preferences and choices. A sub-

Note: The measure of inequality refers to the percentage of total opportunities that must be reallocated to ensure that all possible combinations of circumstances have the same
average enrollment. Low inequality is between 0.3 percent and 2.1 percent, moderate inequality is between 2.3 percent and 6.4 percent, and high inequality is between 6.5 per-
cent and 26.7 percent. Results are sorted by size of gender contribution to total inequality.

Note: The highest level is 6. In mathematics, at level 1, students answer clearly de?ned questions involving familiar contexts; at level 3, students execute clearly de?ned procedures;
at level 5, students develop and work with models for complex situations. In literacy, at level 1 students are capable of completing only the least complex reading tasks; at level 4,
students demonstrate an accurate understanding of long or complex texts whose content or form may be unfamiliar; at level 6, students make multiple inferences, comparisons,
and contrasts, which are both detailed and precise.

   CHAPTER SUMMARY              In reducing gender gaps in education and health, tremendous
                                progress has been made where lifting a single barrier—in
                                households, markets, or institutions—is suf?cient to improve
                                outcomes. Progress has been slower either where multiple barriers
                                need to be lifted at the same time or where a single point of entry
                                produces bottlenecks.

The lives of women around the world have improved dramatically, at a pace and scope dif?cult to imagine
even 25 years ago. Women have made unprecedented gains in rights, education, health, and access to jobs and
livelihoods. More countries than ever guarantee equal rights in property, marriage, and other domains. Gender
gaps in primary schooling have closed in many countries, while in a third of all countries girls now outnumber
boys in secondary school. And more young women than men attend universities in 60 countries. Women are
using their education to participate more in the labor force: they now make up for 40 percent of the global labor
force and 43 percent of its farmers. Moreover, women now live longer than men in every region of the world.
Despite the progress, gaps remain in many areas. Women are more likely to die—relative to males—in many
low- and middle-income countries than their counterparts in rich countries—especially in childhood and
during their reproductive years. Primary and secondary school enrollments for girls remain much lower than
for boys in many Sub-Saharan African countries and some parts of South Asia, as well as among disadvantaged
populations. Women are more likely than men to work as unpaid family laborers or in the informal sector,
to farm smaller plots and grow less pro?table crops, operate in smaller ?rms and less pro?table sectors, and
generally earn less. Women—especially poor women—have less say over decisions and less control over
household resources. And in most countries, fewer women participate in formal politics than men and are
underrepresented in the upper echelons.
The World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development argues that closing these persistent
gender gaps matters. It matters because gender equality is a core development objective in its own right. But
it is also smart economics. Greater gender equality can enhance productivity, improve development outcomes
for the next generation, and make institutions more representative.
Building on a growing body of knowledge on the economics of gender equality and development, the Report
identi?es the areas where gender gaps are most signi?cant—both intrinsically and in terms of their potential
development payoff—and where growth alone cannot solve the issues. It then sets forth four priorities for
public action:
 •   Reducing excess female mortality and closing education gaps where they remain
 •   Improving access to economic opportunities for women
 •   Increasing women’s voice and agency in the household and in society
 •   Limiting the reproduction of gender inequality across generations.
Policies need to focus on the underlying determinants of gender gaps in each priority area. In some priority
areas—such as excess female mortality in infancy and early childhood as well as in the reproductive years—
improving service delivery (especially of clean water and sanitation, and maternal care) is of primary importance.
For other priority areas—such as gender gaps in earnings and productivity—policies need to tackle the multiple
constraints that originate in the workings of markets and institutions to limit progress. Policy makers will need
to prioritize these constraints and address them simultaneously or sequentially.
While domestic policies are central to reducing gender inequalities, development partners should focus on
complementing these efforts in each of the four priority areas, and on supporting evidence-based public
action through better data, evaluation, and learning. This will require a mix of more funding, efforts to foster
innovation and learning, and broader partnerships. The funding should be directed particularly to supporting
the poorest countries in reducing excess female mortality and gender gaps in education. Investments are
needed to improve the availability of better gender-disaggregated data and support more experimentation and
systematic evaluation. And the partnerships should involve the private sector, development agencies, and civil
society organizations.

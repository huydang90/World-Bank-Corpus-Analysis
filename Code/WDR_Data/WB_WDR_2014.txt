Foreword


In recent years, the world has suffered a multitude of crises. Financial and economic turmoil have disrupted
the world economy through loss of income, jobs, and social stability. Intense natural disasters have devastated
entire communities from Haiti to Japan, leaving a trail of fatalities and economic losses in their wake. Concerns
about global warming have grown, as have fears about the spread of deadly contagious diseases.
    As I travel around the world, I hear the same concern: how can we become more resilient to such risks? The
World Development Report 2014 (WDR 2014), Risk and Opportunity—Managing Risk for Development, helps
provide answers to this pressing question.
    Another concern is the missed development opportunities that arise when necessary risks are not taken.
Pursuing opportunities requires taking risks, but many people, especially the poor, are often reluctant to do so,
because they fear the potential negative consequences. Failure to act can trap people in poverty, leaving them
vulnerable to negative shocks and even less able to pursue opportunities that would otherwise improve their
well-being.
    The inability to manage risk properly leads to crises and missed opportunities. This poses significant
obstacles to attaining the World Bank Group’s two main goals: ending extreme poverty by the year 2030 and
boosting shared prosperity of the bottom 40 percent of the population in developing countries. Managing
risk effectively is, therefore, absolutely central to the World Bank’s mission. The WDR 2014 demonstrates that
effective risk management can be a powerful instrument for development—it can save lives, avert economic
shocks, and help people build better, more secure futures.
    This report calls for individuals and institutions to move from being “crisis fighters” to becoming “proactive
and systematic risk managers.” There is substantial evidence that recognizing and preparing for risk can pay
off abundantly. For instance, many developing countries displayed resilience in the face of the recent global
financial crisis because they had previously reformed their macroeconomic, financial, and social policies.
    Protecting hard-won development gains by building resilience to risk is essential to achieving prosperity.
That is true whether one is grappling with natural disasters, pandemics, financial crises, a wave of crime
at the community level, or the severe illness of a household’s chief provider. Risk can never be completely
eliminated. But people and institutions can build resilience to risk by applying a balanced approach that
includes structural policy measures, community-based prevention, insurance, education, training, and
effective regulation. Countries have learned how to manage risk in diverse settings, but, until now, research
related to risk management in the developing world has not been synthesized into a single source that is easily
accessible and well-referenced.
    This WDR aims to fill that gap. It serves as a valuable guide both for mainstreaming risk management into
the development agenda, and for helping countries and communities strengthen their own risk management
systems. The Report also offers important insight for changing the approach to risk in the Bank’s own
operations. The World Bank Group is currently undergoing a transformation, which calls for shifting the
institutional culture regarding risk from one of extreme risk aversion to one of informed risk taking. This
year’s WDR cautions that the greatest risk may be taking no risk at all. I could not agree more.

         My hope is that the WDR 2014 will lead to risk management policies that allow us to minimize the danger of
      future crises and to seize every opportunity for development. Success on this front will help us build the world
      we all want: one free of poverty, with shared prosperity for all.

        mates in each category). Above the dotted line, expected beneﬁts exceed expected costs. The range of estimates within each category
        can be substantial, reﬂecting a diversity of intervention types and locations, and the sensitivity of estimates to variations in underlying
        assumptions. However, in almost all cases, even the 25th percentile of the ranges are above the break-even point.

     in one or the other of the two; and in the bottom row they are low (below the median value) in both ﬂexibility indicators. Similarly, economies in the ﬁrst column
     on the left are low in both formal production and formal labor; in the middle column they are high in one of the two formality indicators; and in the last column
     on the right they are high in both formality indicators. Only economies with data for all four indicators are considered, and median values are calculated within
     this sample.

    Note: The map shows the evolution of the cyclical stance of ﬁscal policy from 1960–99 to 2000–12. The cyclical stance is measured in a regression of the (Hodrick-
    Prescott) cyclical component of general government consumption expenditure on its own lagged value, and the cyclical component of real GDP. The sign of the
    coeﬃcient on the cyclical component of real GDP indicates whether government consumption expenditure is procyclical (positive sign) or countercyclical (nega-
    tive sign). The coeﬃcient on the cyclical component of real GDP was estimated separately for the periods 1960–99 and 2000–12. Then, countries are classiﬁed
    as always countercyclical (in both periods); becoming countercyclical (only countercyclical in 2000–12); becoming procyclical (only procyclical in 2000–12); and
    always procyclical (in both periods). The likely endogeneity of the cyclical component of real GDP was controlled for by using as instruments the (current and
    lagged value of the) cyclical component of real GDP of the country’s main trading partners and international oil prices, as well as the lagged value of the country’s
    own cyclical component of real GDP.

a. The 2005 Afghanistan National Risk and Vulnerability Survey aims to be statistically representative at the national level. However, to the extent that it is diﬃcult to access
   households most acutely aﬀected by insecurity, the data may underestimate shocks for those households. Conversely, it shows that the risks faced by the households that

     a. $1.25 a day is a widely used measure of extreme poverty. However, $2.50 a day is considered a more relevant measure of extreme poverty for some regions,
        such as Latin America and the Caribbean. The $10-a-day measure is an approximate threshold for measuring vulnerability to poverty across regions, which cor-
        relates with asset holdings. The measure is based on studies suggesting that, for some regions, income of at least $10 a day is necessary to achieve the degree
        of economic stability and resilience to shocks that characterizes middle-class households. By contrast, those living below $10 a day are vulnerable to poverty, in
        the sense that they face the possibility of remaining in poverty or easily entering into poverty. See, for example, López-Calva and Ortiz-Juarez 2011; Ferreira and
        others 2013.

G L O S S A R Y 1.1   Terms related to risk management
 Risk                    The possibility of loss. It can be imposed from outside or taken on voluntarily in the pursuit of
                         opportunities.
 Opportunity             The possibility of gain. It can be regarded as the upside of risk.
 Systemic risk           Risk that is common to most members of an entire system.
 Idiosyncratic risk      Risk that is speciﬁc to some members of a system.
 Risk management         The process that involves confronting risks, preparing for them (ex ante risk management), and coping
                         with their eﬀects (ex post risk management).
 Shock                   A change in the world that may be positive or negative and that may occur gradually or suddenly.
 Exposure                The external environment that determines the shocks to which a system is subject.
 Vulnerability           A high susceptibility to loss from negative shocks resulting from a system’s exposure, internal
                         conditions, and risk management.
 Resilience              The ability of a person or system to recover from negative shocks while retaining or improving their
                         functioning.
 Crisis                  A situation in which the adverse outcomes from risk become so severe and generalized that the
                         functioning of the system is threatened.
 Uncertainty             The situation of not knowing what the outcome will be.

     Note: The data are presented on a logarithmic scale. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in the ﬁgure are high-income
     countries that have been members of the OECD for at least 40 years. All other countries are grouped into geographic regions. SD = standard deviation;
     HH = household; GDP = gross domestic product.
     a. Since accurate household consumption and income data are not widely available across countries, household ﬁnal consumption expenditure per capita and
        GDP per capita provide imperfect proxies. Volatility is measured by the standard deviation of the respective growth rates over the period.
     b. This ﬁnding is consistent with the business cycle literature, which ﬁnds that output volatility is signiﬁcantly higher in developing countries than in developed
        countries. See Agénor, McDermott, and Prasad 2000.

a. Each indicator is rescaled to range between zero and one. The index, which is the average of the eight indicators, thus maintains the cardinal properties of the
   indicators, rather than simply being an average of rankings across the components. This approach follows in part the methodology used in the construction of
   the Worldwide Governance Indicators (see Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi 2010). If necessary, each indicator is transformed so that an increase in its measure
   represents an improvement.

          Preparing for the unexpected: An integrated
          approach to disaster risk management in the
          Philippines and Colombia
          The frequency and severity of disasters resulting from natural hazards have been increasing. Losses from disasters
          amounted to $3.5 trillion between 1980 and 2011, with one-third occurring in low- and middle-income countries.
          The complexity of problems posed by natural hazards cannot be addressed by single-sector development planning.
          Thus many countries are responding with multisectoral approaches and are moving quickly toward mainstreaming
          the management of risks from natural hazards into all aspects of development planning and in all sectors of the
          economy. Recognizing that the risks from natural hazards can never be completely eliminated, a balanced approach
          incorporates structural measures, as well as community-based prevention, emergency preparation, insurance, and
          other nonstructural measures, such as education and training or land use regulation. Two of the most eﬀective
          systemic approaches to disaster risk management (DRM) have been developed in Colombia and in the Philippines.

          Protecting the food consumption of the poor:
          The role of safety nets in Ethiopia and El Salvador
          Around the world, 870 million people are chronically undernourished. Environmental degradation, climate change,
          and food price spikes put additional pressures on the ability of poor people to meet their basic food consumption
          needs. The experiences of Ethiopia and El Salvador show that investments in safety nets can be an eﬀective
          mechanism to reduce chronic food insecurity and respond to spikes in food prices.

      cies tailored to the institutional capacity of the country, and build a strong foundation that addresses the most critical obstacles sustainably and that
      can be improved over time.

          Moving toward universal health insurance coverage
          in Turkey and the Kyrgyz Republic

          into poverty annually struggling to cover health care costs. The experiences of Turkey and the Kyrgyz Republic show
          that countries at all levels of development can improve access to and aﬀordability of medical services by increasing
          the eﬃciency of government health spending and protecting the poor through publicly ﬁnanced health insurance.

          Where criminal justice is not enough: Integrated
          urban crime and violence prevention in Brazil and
          South Africa
          Levels of urban crime and violence diﬀer within countries, within regions, and even within states and provinces, as do
          the drivers of crime, which are inﬂuenced by historical, political, cultural, and socioeconomic factors. Despite these
          diﬀerences, successful strategies to reduce and prevent crime and violence have common elements, often referred to
          as an integrated approach to urban crime and violence prevention. Three cities in Brazil and one in South Africa are
          emblematic of this integrated approach to urban crime and violence prevention, which includes communities and

          Moving toward greater labor market ﬂexibility:
          India’s uneven path
          About 1.5 billion people in developing countries are employed in low-productivity informal sector jobs with no social
          security beneﬁts and poor working conditions. What can governments do to create better jobs, and more of them?
          India’s experience shows that states with more ﬂexible labor regulations and lower costs of compliance tend to have
          greater labor mobility and higher productivity and employment in the formal manufacturing sector.

• When developing financial tools to help the poor,

  mind the elements of reliability, convenience, flex-

  on $2 a day is that even those $2 do not always

  is having reliable financial partners and portfo-

  frequently, close to home, and without obstacles.

          Building resilience to global economic shocks in the
          Czech Republic, Peru, and Kenya
          While the recent global economic downturn did not spare many developing countries, they were more resilient to the
          2008 global crisis than to previous crises. The East Asian countries managed systemic risk especially well, but the per-
          formance of several countries in Central Europe, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa has also been remarkable.
          The experiences of three of them—the Czech Republic, Peru, and Kenya—oﬀer two main lessons. First, pursuing
          macroprudential policies in good times, while continuously strengthening the domestic ﬁnancial system, is key to
          building resilience to severe economic downturns. Second, timely countercyclical macro policies not only help man-
          age macroeconomic and ﬁnancial cycles after crises hit but also boost preparation by building or preserving the
          necessary resources (ﬁscal space) to respond to a crisis.

          Note: The ﬁgure compares the correlation between monetary policy rate and real GDP in 1960–99 with that in 2000–09. Both series are
          detrended using the Hodrick-Prescott ﬁlter. A positive (negative) correlation coeﬃcient signals countercyclical (procyclical) monetary
          policy. The countries are classiﬁed as: (a) always countercyclical when the correlations are positive in both periods; (b) becoming counter-
          cyclical when the correlation is negative in 1960–99 and positive in 2000–10; (c) always procyclical when the correlations are negative in

      Note: The map shows the evolution of the cyclical stance of ﬁscal policy from 1960–99 to 2000–12. The cyclical stance is measured in a regression of the (Hodrick-
      Prescott) cyclical component of general government consumption expenditure on its own lagged value, and the cyclical component of real GDP. The sign of the
      coeﬃcient on the cyclical component of real GDP indicates whether government consumption expenditure is procyclical (positive sign) or countercyclical (nega-
      tive sign). The coeﬃcient on the cyclical component of real GDP was estimated separately for the periods 1960–99 and 2000–12. Then, countries are classiﬁed
      as always countercyclical (in both periods); becoming countercyclical (only countercyclical in 2000–12); becoming procyclical (only procyclical in 2000–12); and
      always procyclical (in both periods). The likely endogeneity of the cyclical component of real GDP was controlled for by using as instruments the (current and
      lagged value of the) cyclical component of real GDP of the country’s main trading partners and international oil prices, as well as the lagged value of the country’s
      own cyclical component of real GDP.

          Diseases without borders: Managing the risk
          of pandemics
          Pandemics such as inﬂuenza (ﬂu), AIDS, plague, and smallpox have caused episodes of overwhelming misery and
          economic and social disruptions throughout history. Today, a pathogen that originates in a chicken ﬂock or a goat
          herd in a remote village in Asia or Africa and is then transmitted to humans can reach major cities on all continents
          within 36 hours. Because everyone is vulnerable, management of pandemic risk is the quintessential global public
          good that can yield beneﬁts for all but can be supplied only through collective action. Any country’s eﬀorts to reduce
          the risk are of limited beneﬁt unless all other countries take supportive measures.

B O X 8 .1                 Climate change and implications for development
Climate change is the rise in Earth’s temperature associated with                       threat to development for both current and future generations; the

house gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2). The steady rise, dating                       and the physical environment ranges from $2 trillion to $4 trillion by
from the Industrial Revolution, has been attributed largely to                          2030 depending on the climate scenario.

      Mainstreaming risk management into the
      development agenda: Selected institutional
      reforms
      The discussion that follows expands on four selected areas where fundamental institutional reforms for better risk
      management are needed. The four areas cover integrated risk management, ﬁscal and ﬁnancial risk management,
      social insurance and work status, and multinational approaches to address global risks. Why these four? They are by
      no means exhaustive, but they do represent a framework through which many speciﬁc recommendations provided
      in the Report could be implemented. They discuss innovative solutions to long-standing problems in developing
      countries. They cut across risks and social systems, using a holistic approach to risk management. Along with the
      other recommendations in the Report, they can contribute to mainstreaming risk management into the develop-
      ment agenda. The four reforms may require substantial changes in the way national governments develop and
      implement their general plans.

 Note: X indicates the existence of a tax-related or non-tax-related measure in place at national or subnational levels. Energy eﬃciency refers to measures encouraging the
 purchase of energy eﬃcient equipment (excluding measures speciﬁc to green vehicles or buildings). Carbon and climate change refers to penalties on high emissions
 (such as carbon taxes, emission trading systems or cap and trade mechanisms, and carbon sequestration incentives and penalties). Green innovation includes incentives
 for research and development for green technologies. Renewable energy and fuels refers to use of tax codes to encourage the production or use of renewable or alterna-
 tive fuels and/or penalizing the use of fossil fuels. Green vehicle and buildings refers to tax incentives to reduce the energy consumption of buildings, increase their water
 eﬃciency and sustainability of building materials, and the purchase, lease and use of greener (fuel eﬃcient, hybrid, electric) vehicles (excluding tax penalties and incentives
 related to fuels, which are included under renewable energy and fuels). Water eﬃciency includes use of taxes to encourage corporations to conserve and recycle water
 supplies. Material resource eﬃciency and waste management include use of taxes to promote conservation of material resources, reduction of waste, and recycling of
 waste materials. Pollution control and ecosystem protection include incentives to purchase equipment to reduce the pollution generated by the company or to encourage
 businesses to rehabilitate contaminated lands.

 waste management, pollution control, and ecosystem protection. CO2 = carbon dioxide.

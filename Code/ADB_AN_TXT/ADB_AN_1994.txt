I N 1994, the Board met 54 times in formal sessions and approved a
total lending of $3,687 million ($2,510 million [rom ordinary capital
resources and $1,177 million from the Asian Development Fund) and
investmenis of $50.9 million. These approvals consisted of 48 loan
projects (47 government-guaranteed loan projects ancl one private sector
loan project) and 14 private sector equity investments. The projects
inclucled the first loans for Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz Republic approved in
the very first year of their becoming members of the Bank. The Board also
approved 291 technical assistance grants amounting to $129 million.
The approved projects were in line with the Bank's strategic objectives of
focusing on cross-cutting issues, emphasizing economic growth and
reduction of poverty, The goal also was to make greater use of local
expertise, ericourage transfer of technology and ensure ihe sustainability of
the projects.

Besides its forma! meetings, ihe Board held a nutnber of seminars
and informal discussions. A three-day discussion on the Compendium of
Country Notes 1994-1997, which summarizes the Bank's strategy of
operations in developing mermber countries (DMCs), provided an
opportunity to review coumlry issues in detail, This was complemented by
a discussion on the Bank's Mediim-Term Strategic Framework (19941997), Other significant informal discussions included the Three-Year
Rolling Work Program and Budget Framework (1995-1997), Reorganization of Operational Functions, and Implementation Status of the Task
Farce on Improving Project Quality

Policy Decisions

During 1994, the Board reviewed and approved several major policy
initiatives directed towards increasing the Bank's capacity to assist its
DMCs and enhancing iis effectiveness.

Financial Policies: The most significant policy matler decided by
the Board in 1994 was the fourth General Capilal Increase (GCI IV). A
resolution authorizing GCI IV was adapted by the Board of Governors on
22 May 1994. By this decision, the Bank's authorized anc subscribed
capital stock was increased by 100%. Members have to subscribe to their
shares by 31 December 1995, or a later date as may be determined by
the Board.

During the year, the Board also approved the introduction of a
market-based loan window. The new lending facility will provide funds to
borrowers in three currencies at current terms prevailing in international
capital markets, ancl also take advantage ol interest rate swaps.

In addition fo the above, the Board continued to closely inonitor the
efficient use of the Bank's resources. The Board reviewed the quarterly
financial statements; the Bank’s borrowing program; and ADF resources
and lending. It monitored the overall project adminislralion ol the Bank
through semi-annual Project Adininistralion and Technical Assistanice

Operational Policies: In connection with GCI IV, the Board
discussed a paper on the Bank's Future Direction and Agenda for the
1990s and reached general agreement on the relevance and importance
of the proposed agenda,

The Report of the Task Force on Improving Project Quality was one
of the most Important policy papers reviewed by the Board in 1994, The
Board endorsed the proposed approach, which seeks to improve project
quality by further strengthening project preparation, adopting a stronger
country focus, undertaking an internal reorganization of the Bank,
emphasizing capacity building in DMCs, increasing beneficiary
participation and improving feedback mechanisms,

Discussing the Bank's proposed Forestry Policy, the Board emphasizecl the irnportance of this sector for sustainable development ane
supported the proposed approach to balance production, protection and
participation in tackling complex issues, such as the trade-olf between food
gathering and fuel wood; logging; ard the inleresis of resource-rich and
resource-poor countries.

The paper on Population Policy highlighted the crucial bul complex
relationship hetween population growth and economic development. The
Roard stressed the role of women's education in population planning anc
the need to pay attention to social ancl cultural issues in designing calintry
strategies.

The Board supported the policy paper on Confidentiality and
Disclasuve of Inforrnation and endorsed the presumption in favor of
disclosure. Tagether with the new Information Policy, also approved
during the year, this approach would transform the Bank into a more
open, accessible and transparent institution, and win greater support for its
agenda and objectives.

Internal Structure and Functioning

The Board also approved policies related to the internal structure
and functioning of the Bank, These were the Reorganization of the Bank;
Special Separation Program for Staff; Organizational Changes to the
Administrative Tribunal; and the General Review of Salaries and Benefits.
Thess policies were aimed al shengihening the internal funclioning of Lhe
Bank through better staff mobilization, and irmproving slaff motivation
through appropriate incentives,

Board Committees

Audit Committee: The Audit Committee of the Board met on 13
aceasions. The Committee reviewed 12 Project Performance Appraisal
Reports, and three Impact Evaluation Stuclies in respect of the Bank's
lending and lechnica! assistance operations. It also reviewed the 1993
financial statements with the outside auditors of the Bank, appointed the
outside auditers for 1995 and oversaw the activities of the Internal Audit
Office,

The Committee presented its annual report to the Board of Directors
in June. The report expressed special concern at the inadequate level of
rnaintenance of project facilities which often impaired the sustainability of

%project benefits. The Committee considered the matter important enough
to be addressee at the design stage of all Bank projects. Unless the issue
was addressed more forcefully, there was little prospect of improving the
sustainability of projects in the critical infrastructure and agriculture
seclors.

The Committee noted that a significant number of the Bank's
agriculture projects faced serious implemeniation problems. Considering
the coritinued importance of agriculture to the bulk of the Bank's DMCs,
improvements in the design and implementation of the Bank’s agriculture
projects were required, Mairuenance of large-scale irrigation projects was,
jn particulary, olten a problem. The Committee felt that the need for such
projects in future should be re-evaluated ‘

The Committee recognized that benefits accruing from agriculture
and social sector projects iended to be dispersed and, often being external
to the project, were difficult to monitor. Improved evaluation techniques
to capture all benefits were nected for a more realistic post-evaluation of
projects, In this connection, the Committee ~ while reaffirrning the
importance of evaluating a project as measured against its objectives at
appraisal ~ felt that evaluation methods should be refined to measure the
intangible, social and other benefits that accrued from such projects to
society in general and to the developrnent of women in particular.

The Committee noted that the perlormance of the Internal Audit
Office was highly cornumendable and appreciated its approach to look
beyond a restricted accounting audit function towards a broader performance audit of the Bank.

Budget Review Committee: The Budget Review Committee
discussed the work plans of various departments and offices, deliberated
on substantive issues underlying Management’s 1995 Budget proposal
and reached a consensus on its recommendation with regard to the 1995
Budget.

The Committee noted with concern the substantial shortlall in new
lending commitments to the public and private sectors in 1994, as well as
in the volume of co-financing arranged. It hoped that the situation would
improve in 1995,

In reviewing the status of last year’s recommendations, the
Committee expressed satisfaction, in particular, that Management hac
implemented the recommendation to include a detailed preview of the
coming year’s buclget in the Three Year Rolling Work Program and
Budget Framework, informally discussed in early October, This had given
the Beard an early opporlunily to provide its views on the overall size,
shape and direclions of the 1995 Budget in the context of the mediumterm work and budget framework.

The Committee welcomed the fact that the 1995 Budget provided for
1 increase in professiénal staff positions and virtually no increase in
supporting staff pasitions. It noted that the expected increase in the Bank's

 

overall workload was to be met through a streamlining of staff allocations 
[through internal reorganization, productivity improvement and upgrading
of staff skills resulting from the Speciat Separation Program, The Contmittee also expected that implementation of the Bank's network-based
information technology program would have a significant impact on staff
requirements, productivity and efficiency.

Budgel, the Conunittee recommenced that these positions be reviewed
and allacated by Managernent following implementation of the internal
reorganization, taking into account the Bank's operational priorities in’
the Pacific area and other requirements. The Cormmittee agreed thal
widening the pool of potential candid for external recruitment would
assist the Bank to achieve both a better gender balance ancl a more
representative geographical balance in its staff. The Committee also
welcomed the idea of developing a policy to allow the recruitment of
professional siaff at all levels through internal as well as external competition.

The Committee supported the salary policy review for professional
staff to be completect in the first half of 1995, It requested that this review
also include studies on the currency denomination of Bank salaries and
on the efficiency and effectiveness of the rental subsidy scheme.

In the light of its deliberations and based on consislency with the
Three-Year Rolling Work Program and Budget Framework, lhe Commit
tee unanimously agreed to recommend Board approval of the proposed
Budget for 1995 amounting to $188.3 million.

 

Directors’ Visits

The Board of Directors undertook two group visits in 1994: the firsl
to Banglades and Pakistan fom 14 to 31 July, and the second to the
People's Republic of China (PRC) end Mongolia from 28 August to 16

for a brighter

future for the area's

For Development:
Opportunities and Challenges

O VER Lhe last lwo decades, lhe Asian and Pacifle region has

 

become the world's most dynamic in economic development. Feonemic
interlependence among the Asian and Pacific developing countries has
increased steadily, as have their efforts for greater regional cooperation
for development. Results of such efforts can be seen in the development
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the ASEAN Free
‘Trade Area (APTA), the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and other innovative types of cooperation such as in the
greater Mekong subregion.

Support for regional cooperation among its developing member
countries (DMCs) is a fundamental part of the Bank’s operations. The
Bank's Charter gives it a mandate to give priority to projects and pro
grams that will coritribute most elfectively to the hannonious economic
growth of the region as a whole. Over the years, the Bank has expanded
its activities in promeoling regional cooperation in line with the needs of
its DMCs. In light of the changing exlerral and internal environments
faced by the DMCs, it will continue to do so in future.

 
  

Background and Rationale

‘The economic argument for regional cooperation can be traced back
“to the concept of the customs union, which was formulated in the 1950s.
The concept revolves around aspects of trade creation ancl trade diversion, Trade creation is aimed at increasing trade between partners but no
chauge is assumed in their tracle with the rest of the world. By contrast,
trade diversion is accompanied by increased trace within the union at the
expense of tracle with Lhe rest of the world, Recerlly, however, regioual
cooperation has been encouraged by considerations of benefits that
geographically contiguaus countries and areas could derive by working
together. .

The major rationale for regional cooperation is that it helps exploit
convplementarities among qroups of countries ane areas to generate a
greater momentum of growth. Economic complementarity arises when
differences occur among neighboring countries in the availability of
natural resources and other inputs, such as labor and capital.
Complementarity can also exist when countries are at different stages of
economic development and possess different degrees of technological
and fabor skills. In such an environment, cooperation could lead to a
more elficient use of resources and promote intra-regiunal trade and
irivestment.

Foonomic cooperation could also take place among couriries at
similar levels of development. In this instance, lhe gains of cooperation

could be derived by extending markets among partners and through
product specialization, labor mobility and technological exchange.

Regional cooperation could also involve joint development of public
goods, 2.g., transportation and communications, the environment,
research, education and technical standards. Development of these
goods is often hampered by conflicts about the distribution of costs and
benefits among patticipants. To eliminate these obstacles, cooperation is
desirable.

In recent years, a new concept of “open regionalisin” has emerged.
Under this concept, cooperation seeks nol only lo reduce intra-regional
barriers to econoinic interaction, bul also lo lower external barriers for
economies which are not part of the cooperation arrangement. Such an
approach to world regionalism may not be necessarily in conflict with
multilateralism, which enphasizes global liberalization of trace and
investment, With appropriate formulation and implementation, open
regionalistn could even accelerate the multilateral process,

Though the pace of regional cooperation was slow among DMCs
for many years, a number of forces and pressures have emerged in the
last decade to stimulate the Asia-Pacific developing countries to enhance
their efforts at regianal cooperation,

First, trade interdependence among these countries has grown.
High income levels achieved by some of these countries and shifting
comparative advantages of many of them have resulted in a rapid
expansion of intra-regional trade. Since the beginning of the 1980s,
particularly after 1986, a profound shift has occurred in the geographic
pattern of exports. The region itself has become its own important and
rapidly expanding market. Consequently, the share of inlra-DMC exporls
to total exports increased from 26% in 1980 to 40% in 1992 (see
Figure 1}. .

Second, direct investment flows wiihin the region have rapidly
expanded. Developing Asia has been generally very successhul in attracting foreign direct investment since the 1980s. Net inflows of foreign
direct Investments into DMCs increased substantially from $14 billion in
1991 to ar-estimated $44 billion in 1994. As a result, the share of the
Bank’s DMCs in the total foreign direct investment in the developing
world increased from 40% in 1991 to 56% in 1994. While Japan has,
traditionally, been the rnost important source of such investments for
DMCs, ihe share of other regional countries has grown in recent years.
The newly industrializing economies (NIEs) have emerged as a major
source. Large amounts are also flowing from Southeast Asia to the
People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Viet Nam.

The significance of increased intra-regional investrnenis goes much
beyond financial flows. Such investments have become an itaportant
instrument for the realization of the so-called “flying-ceese” pattern of
industrial development in Asia, i.e., the relocation of industries fromm one
tier of economy to the next in response to shifling corparalive adyantages. ,

Third, most DMCs are going through a phase of economic liberalization, which provides a solid foundation for he success nf regional
cooperation. DMCs have increasingly recognized that trade liberalization
is in their own interest, Indeed, many of them have unilaterally under

Among the NIEs, Hong Kang and Singapore have been virtually free yo py ;

trade economies. Tracle liberalization has accelerated in Republic of The, Bank's foe
Korea and Taipei,China. In Southeast Asia, Malaysia hag further reduced DMCs wou Id:

In recent years, a new wave ‘of trade liberalization has hit most South sucn ar eas as :

Fourth, Asia's centrally planned economies are now apen to the “po verty and
outside world, enlarging opportunities for business and cooperation. : : ’

Since 1979, when PRC launched its ‘open door’ policy, it has made human resource
impressive progress in lowering import barriers and decentralizing ‘
external trade. The foreign exchange regime has also been liberalized. In develop ment.
Lao PDR and Viet Nam, trade policy liberalization has been an important
cornponent of market-oriented reforms. Since 1990, these countries
have removed most export ancl import quotas, arid abolished export
subsidy and export proceeds retention schemes.

The opening of PRC has enabled the rapid growth of economic
cooperation among Hong Kong, Taipei,China ancl PRC's two southern
provinces of Guangdong and Fujian, Many manufacturing activities have
moved [rorn Hong Kong and Taipei,China lo Guangdong and Fujian in
search of lower labor and land costs. This has enabled the two economies
to move up the technological lacder to higher-value. activities, such as
packaging, marketing and financial intermediation, These developments
represent a new farm of cooperation that differs significantly from
conventional, arms-length trade. They engage participants in a vertically
integrated precuction structure crossing national borclers, benefiting all of
them.

Fifth, the formulation of the Maastricht Treaty for European Union
(EU) and of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have
reinforced the global trend toward open regionalism and encouraged
DMCs to strengthen their own cooperative arrangements, EU and
NAFTA show that greater intemal integration not only benefits the
econornies involved, but can, if pursued in strict compliance with General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) rules, complement the process
of global trade liberalization. For instance, Asia’s trade wilh (he European
Community has steadily grown together with he broadening and deepening of the FU, In addition, open regionalism can further the cause of
global tracle by bringing into focus issues of common concem on a mich
broader range.

Finally, the Bank’s DMCs would benefit fram cooperation in such
areas as transportation, telecommunicalions, energy, forestry, environment, poverty and human resource development. Such cooperation will
contribute to ecanemic growth since the inadequacy af social and
physical infrastructure has become an obstacle to growth in many DMCs.
Though much of the necessary infrastructure is purely national in scope,
important components can often be extended across national boundaries.ANNUAL REPORT 1994

Typically, cross-border road and railway linkages, development of interstate elecommumications, control of transmittable diseases such as AIDS,
and environmental regulations can have significant regional impacts.
These components of infrastructure can be developed more efficiently on
a regional rather than a national basis. In addilion, infrastructure investments usually clisplay siqnificant externalities. Monopolistic supply
situations of infrastructure projects could lead to failures of market
mechanisms. In such cases, regional cooperation is particwarly important
in providing a higher level of efficiency.

 

Major Waves

Since the 1950s, the world has witnessed two major waves of
regional cooperation. The lirst wave began in the early 1960s and
continued through the 1970s. Encouraged by the creation of the Furopean Corimunity in 1958, regional trading arrangements rapidly spread
throughout Alrica, Latin America, and other parts of the developing
world. However, for develaping countries, the result of the first wave of
regional cooperation was rather disappointing. First, the general institu-REGIONAL COOPERATION FOR DEVELOPMENT: QPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES

tional problems associated with the distribution of gains and losses among
the participating countries were much more difficult than anticipated.
Second, cooperation arrangenierits in those days were based on regional
import substitution and bureaucratic negotiation rather than on trade
liberalizalion and the operation of market forces. ally, cooperation
look place mosly arnong developing countries with trade patterns Lhat
were parallel rather than complementary. As a resull, the poteritial Jor
tracle expansion was reslrained because of generally low per capita
income and the cleminance of resource-based primary commodities.

The second wave began in the mid-1980s. The Single European
Act and free trace arrangements of the United States, first with Canada
and later with Mexico, gave a reglonal cooperation a new stimulus.
During this period, Australia and New Zealand decided to eliminate all
tariffs arid quota restrictions among themselves within a few years and
liberalize trace in services between the two countries. The Organization
of African Unity announced an ambitious plan to establish a continental
comrion rnarket within 4 few decades, Later, Argentina. Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay were also headed towards a common market. in
Asia, the AFTA agreement was signed in 1992, Ideas for the creation of
APEC and lhe East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC) were proposed inANNUAL REPORT 1994

The Asia-Pacific Foonomic
Cooperation (APEC) was established at a meating of foreign and
economic ministers in Canberra in
1989. Hs objective is ta promote
the interdependence of trade and
cornmeree and support economic
growth in the Pacific region. Its
cutrent membership consists of
Australia, Brunei Darussalam,
Canada, PRC, tlong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, Republic of
Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea,
Philippines, Singapore,
Taipei,China, Thailand ard United
States.

activity and 40% of total world
exports. There Is also increasing
trade within the APEC region, North
America’s dependence on trade with
APEC members increased from
43.9% in 1980 to 57.5% in 1991,
During the same period, Asia’s trade
dependence on APLC increased
from 60.1% to 70.7%.

APEC provides a forum for the
discussion of a broad range of
regiorial econoniic issues. Since its
first meeling in Australia, armual
ministerial meetings have been held
in Singapore (1990), Seoul (1991)
and Bangkok (1992). In 1993, Asian
Pacific region leaders met in Seattle
for the first ever APEC summit, when
a commitice on trace and investment

 

 

set target dates to achieve free trade
within the APEC region: 2020 for”
the developing economies ard
2010 for the developed nations.

APEC members are committed
to “open regionalismn” designed to
encourage greater openness .
throughout the global economy as
well as in the region. Progress
under APEC could supplement the
multilateral trade system and benefit
the global economy.

Currently, the APEC members
are working on the details and
measures for implementation of the
free trade agreement. It is expected
that the APEC will play an increasing role in speeding up trade and
investment liberalization as well as

There are al leasl Unree important dillerences between the second
wave and the first. For one thing, the current efforts are based on
outward-looking and market-oriented development slrategies. The driving
force is private initiative and competition. For anolher, while the focus
previously was more on supplying regional markets [hrough cooperative
arrangements which substituted comestic procucts for imporls, ihe new
vegionalism has a much wider scope. The progress of trade reforms in
the past decades has led to a generally more liberal trading environment.
and countries have come'to put greater emphasis on caoperation in
transportation, communication, technology and environmental issues,
Vinally, the new phase of regional cooperation stresses both North-South
and South-South integration. In contrast, during the first wave, develaping countries sought integration almost exclusively among themselves
alone. It is now realized that North-South cooperation can provide
enormous cpportunities for trade expansion, speed up technological
transfer and encourage large-scale capital and labor movernent.

Regional Initiatives

The speciacular economic growlh of the Asian and Pacific region,
particularly of the Fast and Southeast Asian economies, has vastly
expanded the scape for regional economic cooperation. Quile a lew
groupings already exist in the region and several others are under
ciseussion. The forms of such cooperation range fram small subregionalREGIONAL COOPERATION FOR DEVELOPMENT: OPPORTUNITIES

growth triangles to larger regional initiatives, such as the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), SAARC and APEC (see Table}.

“ASEAN is the most well-established of the cooperation ventures in The spectacu lar

Asia. Formed in 1967, the group's primary objective is to promote the “economic

security, economic growth and social and cultural development of the y

subregion. Although ASEAN's direct economic achievements in the early g rowth of the,
years were modest, it has played a significant role in promoting peace Asian and Paci fi c
andl stability, thereby providing a sound environment for private sector ;

development and foreign direct investmenis. Since the 1980s, ASEAN region

has reemphasized the importance of economic cooperation and pro- has vastly

posed several cooperation schemes. In 1992, the ASEAN countries ts

agreed to create AFTA with Lhe goal of lowering all barriers to intra- expanded t h e

2008. To show their commitment to APTA, the governments decided to a 3
accelerate the reduction of tariffs on 15 broad industrial product group- regiona l economic

ings. Ti is expected that the AFTA arrangement will greatly promote both
intra-ASFAN and intra-Asian trade.

In 1985, seven South Asian countries ~ Bangladesh, Bhutan, Incia,
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka - got together in a summit
meeting and launched SAARC, ‘The fundamental goal of SAARC is to
accelerate economic anc social developrnent in the subregion. Since the
formation of the group, several important steps have been taken to
enhance cooperation among the member courttries. A SAARC secretariat as been established, a SAARC Agriculiural Information Center has
been set up and a SAARC Meteoralogic Research Center has been
lorrmed. A SAARC Pryelerential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA} was
proposed in 1993. Under this arrangement, each member country is
expected Lo exchange a request list of commodities for which it seeks
taviff concessions from another SAARC country. Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal
aml Sri Lanka have already ratified SAPTA. Cooperation has also begun
in the area of poverty alleviation. An action plan has been prepared,
including a strategy for social mobilization, empowerment of the poor,
promotion of agriculture and small-scale industry, and the development of
human and financial resources.

APEC is by far the largest cooperative grouping in the workl. The
combined economies of the APEC members account for almost half the
world’s GDP and 4.0% of total world exports Gee Box 1). Following the
creation of the APEC forum in 1989 and the establishment of a secretariat in January 1993 in Singapore, APEC has grown [rom an informal
group to a formal institution comprising major economies in the Asian
and Pacific region. At ils 1994 summit in Bogor, Indonesia, the instltution decided that by the year 2010, its cevelopect member countries
would remove all trade harriers and that. by the year 2020, the whole
APEC region would enjoy free trace,

A more informal arrangement for economic cooperalion is being
promoted by several couniries interconnected by the Mekong River. The
complementarity of the economies in the Mekong subregion was recog:
nized as early as 1957, when the Committee for the Coordination of
Investigations of Lower Mekong Basin was established. However, because
of continued political turmoil in the area, the degree of couperalion was
negligible for many years.

In 1992, economic cooperation in the Greater Mekong subregion,
comprising Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam and
Yunnan Province of PRC, entered a new phase. Since then, an invesl
cooperation.ANNUAI REPORT 1994

ment promotion forum and a network of chambers of commeree and
industry have beer established, Upon the request of the governments
concerned, the Bank has irnplemented a comprehensive study to facilitate and support the cooperation arrangement. This inchides reinforcing
the subregional consultative process at the ministerial and senior official
level, and preparing viable projects for implementation. Many initiatives
have been propased and some of the work programs are already
producing substantial and tangible benefits for the subregion (see Box 2).

Sire the East Asian subregion is expected te continue experiencing
economic growth in the coming decades, economic IInkages among Last
Asian countries will increase and becorne more intertwined. As such,
development issues need to be addressed collectively. The East Asia
Feonomic Caucus (EAEC), which is a loose consultative forum, would be
an effective vehicle to strengthen the cooperative links among the East
Aglan economies and promote a free and global trading systern. In
addition, EAEC would also provide opportunities for discussion on
developmental issues that have relevance ta the continued growth of East
Asia.

There are two major cooperative arrangements among the Pacific
island countries: the South Pacific Forum and the South Pacific Commission,

Through its permanent secretariat, the South Pacific forum piromotes cooperation in economic, trade. transport, tourism, telecornmunicatioris, energy, legal, political and security matters, Among the institulions sel up by it are the Forum Fisheries Agency, established in 1979 to
provide Lechnical assistance to members in the development and management of fisheries, and the Pacific Foruwn Line, set up in 1977 to
improve shipping links within the region.

The South Pacific Corrmissiort is the South Pacific region's largest
and oldest cooperative arrangernant, It is involved in advisory and

 

 

  

 

. consultative activities aimed at promoting the region's economic and

social development. The commission's work program comprises five
major sectors: agriculture, marine resources, health, socioeconomic
statistical services and community education.

More recently, the definition of regional cooperation has been
extended to include even sections of different countries which have
incentives to cooperate on a limited basis. The term “grawth triangle”
has now come to be adopted to describe such limited arrangements after
it was first used in 1989 to desctibe the initiative involving Singapore,
South Johor in Malaysia arid Riau Islancts tn Indonesia, Economic
cooperation among long Kong, Taipei,China and southern China
{mainly Guangdong and Fujian provinces) is known as the Southern
China Growth Triangle. The Fumen River Area Development Program,
which includes parts of PRC’s dilin province, parts of the Siberian region of Russia and the Democratic Peaple's Republic of Korea. have also
been described as a growth triangle. Mongolia, Republic of Korea and
Japan are participants in this lriangle through the provision of capital and
natural resources. Recently, a growlh triangle involving parts of
Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand has been identified. A proposal to
create an east ASEAN growth area is under consideration. IL will involve
Brunei Darussalam and parts of Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines (see
Box 8). :

Compared with other forms of regional cooperation, growth
triangles have distinct characteristics of their own. First. unlike a freeWins a oe tend : area, ot.

comprises Cambodia, Lao PDR,
Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nath and:
Yunnan Provinee of PRC. The

people who not only share the
world’s twelfth largest river, but also
have close cultural and historical
links. Recent political and enonomic
developments in the area have
creaied the environment for closer
econamic cooperation among the
neighboring countries, Peace ance
more reigns over most ofthe area
and the formerly centrally-planned
economies are in various stages of
transition to a more open and
market-based system,

a growlh triangle is not only to promote trade within the subregion, but

- also to exploil the comparative advaniages of the participating economies
through the reallocation of prockuction bases for purposes of export. This
oulward-oriented structure makes growth triangles particularly appropri:
ate for countries in cleveloping Asia, whose internal markets are often
small. Finally, non-discriminating nature of a growth triangle makes it
capable of extending economic benefits to nonparticipating countries.
both by offering market access and by attracting foreign investment.

Problems and Prospects

Looking ahead, the prospects for regional cooperation in Asia
remain bright. The receril cornpletion of the GATT and the establishment
of the World Trade Organization (WTO) reinforce the multilateral foundaWon of the world Lrade system and will provide large additional gains from
trace through further liberalization in the region. It is expected that
economic cooperation in Asia will become an important driving force for
accelerating intra-regional trace and investment and maintaining the

region's economic dynamism.

However, cooperation has its challenges, too. First, the Asian and
Pacific reqion comprises many econornies at different stages of develop

developments in the Asian regional
economic scene in recent years is
the emergence of “growth
triangles.” ‘hese are transitional
econornic zories spread over welldefined and proximate geographical areas and usually involving
three or more countries,

The firsl and so far the most
established growth Lriangle in Asia
involves cooperation among Hong
Kong, Taipei,China and southern

. China, mainly parts of Guangdong
and Fujian provinces, Since 1979,
PRC’s ‘open door’ policy and its
establishment of special economic
zones have provided investors from
Long Kong and Talpei,China with
the most convenient and logical
venue for diversifying their
production bases, Unlike the other
triangles which are formed mostly
oul of the deliberate initiatives of
governments, the Southern China

 

 

Box 3: Growth Triangles in Asia

Growth Triangle is largely a market
and private sector-driven
arrangement, Common cultural
herliage also played an important
role in the development of the
triangle. ¢ .

[n the beginning, cooperation
was limited mainly to four special
economic zones, Later, the entire
Pearl River delta area was involved.
Now, business operations under this
growih triangle have extended to
almost all of Guangdorig and Fujian
provinces and are gradually moving
inland to other provinces.

The second major growth

Singapore, the southern part of the

more recent than the Johor/

To facilitate the movement of
labor-intensive factories to Riau
Islands, the Batam Industrial
Corporation, jointly owned by
Singaporean aiid Indonesian public
and private sector irilerests, was
created,

ment, There are wide disparities in the levels of income, scales of
economic and social organization, and market size. As a result, the
benefits of cooperation may nol be similar for all the participating
economies. Considerable efforts must, therefore, be made to design and
implement cooperative arrangements in terms ol cost sharing and benefit

Second, regional cooperation requires strong political will and a
sustained commitment from all the participating governments. At the
national level, there is a need to implement appropriate policies relating
to tariffs. employment regulations, foreign investment and foreign
exchange. Institutional arrangements and mechanisms for supporting
cooperation alsa require considerable strengthening. In particular,
appropriate financial mechanisms need to be developed to allocate
resources and manage the risks of regional programs and projects

Finally, although the GATT agreement provides a solid foundation
fer regional cooperation, attention will have to be paid to issi

concerns like bilateral disputes and dumping, which could adversely affect

The success of regional cuoperation in Asia, therefore, cannot be ,
taken for granted. The developing nations of Asia need Lo make greater

efforts to create a more liberal Lracling and investment environment to

Seterritory and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK). Japan, Republic of Korea
and Mongolia are involved in the
triangle through their roles in
providing capital and natural
resources. The rationale for the
viangle is that. natural resources of
Siberia and Mongolia could be
processed in PRC and DPRK with
the help of capital and technology
from Japan and Republic of .
Korea. The trlangle is also strategically located at one pole of the
rans-Siberian land bridge between
Europe and Asia. According to an
estimation by the United Nations
Development Prograrnme, the
development of specialized ports,
roads, airports and an international
city in the Tumen River economic
zone will cost $30 billion over a
period of 20 years. A number of
steps to establish the triangle have
already been taken

 

REGIONAL COOPERATION FOR DEVEIOPMEN1

A fourth one js the [nclonesiaMalaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle,
consisting of the states of northern
Sumatra and DI Aceh in Indonesia,
four states in northern Malaysia, and
five provinces in southern Thailand,
The total area of this triangle is
180,000 sq km and the combined
population is about 22 million. The
area displays significant differences in
natural resource endowments, givirig
rise to numerous potential trade and
investment cornplementarities, The
overall goal of this triangle is to
accelerate private sector-led economic growth, exploiting these
complementatities. A study of the

_ area's potential was initiated by the
Bank in late 1993 at the request of
the governments concerned and
completed in September 1994, The

proposed is the East ASEAN
Growth Area involving Brunei
Darussalam, west and east
Kalimantan and north Sulawesi in Indonesia; Sabah and Sarawak in

- Malaysia, and Mindanao and.

Palawan, in the Philippines. The
zone has a tolal land area of
700,000 sq km and a population

_of more than 24 million, While the

poiential for cooperation is
enormaus owing to the area's rich
natural resources, including
forestry and timber products,
marine products, oil, gas, gold,
cHamonel and crystal sand, the
main constraint is lack of infrastructure. In April 1994, the Bank was
requested by the four governments
to finance and coordinate a study
of the area Lo identify ways in
which existing interactions may be
better developed and new links
established, The study is expected
lo be completed in 1995,

consolidate the impressive gains of the past and to prornote further

economic prosperity. Only through the principle of “open regionalisin”
can they expect to maximize the benefits of trade crealion and minimize
the effects of trace diversion, In this regard, APEC and AFTA should be
encouraged in their pursuit of a non-discriminatory and non-preferential
agenda for reform and harnuotizalion. The goal of regional cooperation
is not only to reduce trade barriers, bul also ta make sure that the
cooperalion arrangement is not prejudicial to the well-being of nonparticipating partes.

IL is important to emphasize that the scope of regional cooperation
can be expanded beyond mere free trade arrangements. Cooperation
can help substantially in liberalizing investments, integrating financial
markets, enhancing technology transfer, improving infrastructure,
developing natural and human resources, protecting the environment and
fulfilling common objectives in research and education.

Given that the progress of GALT and trade liberalizations of the past
decades have already led to more liberal trading environments and thal
the trend will probably continue, regional cooperation in the future could
focus on these other aveas. In particular, infrastructure linkages between
the countries are vitally important for the region's continued economic
success. However, because infrastructure investments usually involve
large amourits of capilel, a sophislicated system of henefit distribution, as
well as security and enwironment problems, the challenges in this regardANNUAL REPORT 1994

are as considerable as opportunities.

Environmental protection is another important area where regional
cooperation is badly needed. Over the past decades, rapid economic
development in Asia has been accompanied by a depletion of natural
resources ancl degradation of the environment, particularly in burgeoning
urban and industrial areas. Environmental degradation is no longer only a
national Issue. It ls a regional and global issue as well, Regional cooperation on natural resource management and environmental protection are,
therefore, vital for the long-term sustainable development of the Bank's
DMCs.

Cooperation can be promoted in a number of ways. While APEC
and ASEAN promote large-scale cooperation, subregional cooperation or
the growth triangle approach has its own clistinct attractions. The lowcost, low-risk, localized and outward-oriented approach of subregional
cooperation makes it an appropriate modalily for cooperation among

- countries having similar needs, The advantage here is that the beginning

can be sinall ancl fulure expansion of lhe arrangement can be better
planned. Through such planned expansion, lhe benefils of subregional
cooperation could spill aver to a much larger area. While lrade and
investment are the major concems of growth triangles, cooperation could
also promote sacial and infrastructural development in the participating
areas. The subregional approach may be well suited to countries such as
Cambodia, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Viet Nam and the Central Asian
republics, which are in the process of transiting from centrally-planned
economy to market-oriented economies. Growth triangles provide a good
way of demonstrating the potential of export-led strategies to accelerate
economic development. They alse help countries to enter world markeis
and attract foreign investment. In the same way, for some South Asian
countries which have recently ciscardedl their biases against experts, the
subregional approach could be an effective means of pursuing outwardoriented and export-led growth strategies. A series of furthey studies are
neecled to identify other potential areas in Asia where subregional
cooperation can be developed in the future.

The Bank’s Role

The Bank’s Charter gives it a mandate to foster economic cooperaion in the Asian and Pacific region.

The Bank's Medium-Term Strategic Frarnework emphasizes the
promotion of regional cooperation as one of ils slrategic roles. The Bank
recognizes that such cooperation could produce substantial beriefits in
trace, investment, finance, technology, infrasiructure, natural and hurnan
resource development, and environmental protection,

The Bank has three complementary functions in promoting regional
cooperation. First, through its research and regional technical assistance
activities, it provides information to increase DMCs’ understanding of the
importance of cooperation. It applies its experience to identify possible
bottlenecks ta cooperation and suggest how these could be overcome.
Second, because of its nonpartisan character, the Bank is in a position to
act as an “honest broker”. While cooperation depends on the incivicual
and collective political will of the DMCs concerned, the Bank plays an
important supportive role by encouraging dialogue, suggesting approaches and identifying possible projects. Third, as a development

a

catalyst, the Bank is able not only to provide its own funds to support
regional cooperation, but can also help mobilize funds from other
sources, such as muttilateral ancl bilateral agencies, and the private sector.

The nature of the Bank's involvement in regional cooperation has
evolved in line with the needs of its DMCs, In its early years, the Bank
coordinated stuclies for a number of subregional projects, such as the
Nong Khai-Vientiane bridge across the Mekong River linking Lao PDR
and Thailand, and the trans-Malacca ferry service between North Sumatra
in Indonesia and Penang in Malaysia. The Bank also finded anc acted as
the administrator of subregional activities related to the Nam Ngurn
Hydropower project irr Lao PDR, which supplies its surplus power to
Thailanel.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Banks's regional activities also included
contributions to regional research institutions such as the International
Rice Research Institute, the Asian Productivity Organization and the
Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center, etc, It sponsored
sueh major regional surveys as the Asian Agriculture Survey (1967 and
1976), the Asian Industrial Survey (1971), the Fish Market Stucy (1975),
the Southeast Asian Regional Transport Survey (1968-1970), the South
Pacific Agricultural Survey (1978) and the Regional Energy Survey
(1980).

Following the recornmendations of two slralegic studies, the Stuy of
Operational Priorities and Plans of the Asian Development Bank for the
1980s June 1983) and the Panel Report on the Asian Developrnent
Bank in the 1990s (January 1989), the Bank has strengthened its
reyional role in recent years. [t uses its regional technical assistance
progrart lo support inare diversified reginnal activities (see Figure 2).
Such assistance frorn the Bank increased from an average of $700,000 a
year in the 1970s to $17.5 million a year in the first half of the 1990s,

One regional activity the Bank has supported is economic cooperation in the greater Mekong subregion, The Bank has funded a comprehensive study of the prospects of such cooperation atnong the six
countries of the subregion: Cambodia, Lao POR, Myanmar, Thailanel,
Viel Nam and Yunnan Province of PRC. A series of reports have been
prepared to identify the scope, opportunities, benefits, costs and mechanisms for enhancing cooperation. ‘The transport and eneray seclors have
been identified as essential to expancling subregional couperalion and
detailed sector studies have been prepared. Many possible joint actions
have also been cited in the areas of tourist. ade, invesiment, environment and hurnan resource development.

The Bank has also aclively promoted the concept of growth triangles. In early 1993, lhe Bank conducted a workshop to evaluate the
experience of existing growth triangles in Asia. In late 1993, as requested
by the governments concerned. the Bank initiated a study on the
Indonesia-Malaysia-Uhailand growth triangle. The stucly, completed in
September 1994, has clearly established that, whatever the constraints,
complernentarities among the three countries are strong enough for
substantial cooperation, Nearly 100 policy, program, project and institu
tional actions have been recommended by the study.

More recently, a proposal bas been made for a similar study exploring the potential for an east ASEAN growth area involving Brunei
Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines. The stucly is expected
to be completed in the second half of 1995,

In acklition, the Bank has supported studies on such specific regional

such as development round tables, workshops on Asian economic outlook
arid conferences on development economics, provide occasions for
multilaleral policy dialogue on matters that concern the region as a whole.

Future Directions

Bank support for regional cooperation activities depends on the
development priorities of the DMCs and their need for assistance, The
Bank has drawn up guidelines to delermine the nature of its support for
specific regional initiatives. According lo these guidelines, support should:

() be congruent with glohal trade arid investinent liberalization, as
under the GATT agreement. ft shouid be a means of hastening the
application of competitive forces that will strengthen DMCs’ abilities to
cormpete in the international marketplace;

fii) be financially and administratively feasible and sustainable;

{iii) not duplicate or compete with related efforts of other international orgarizations and national entities; and

(iv) be integral to the development strategic framework in both
DMCs and the Bank,

The Bank will use a “phased approach” to expand its suppor! lor
regional cooperation in keeping with its increasing understanding of
regional issues and its capability of assisting DMCs. In the first phase, lhe
emphasis will be on enhancing DMCs’ understanding of the potential of
cooperalion. This will be done by () reviewing existing reseaych to identify
areas of possible cooperation; (il) providing technical assistance fo
undariake new research to quantify potential benefits and help DMCs
learn from one another; ard (iii} facilitating discussion arnong the DMCs,
the Bank and other international and bilateral agencies on the results of
such research. Research results will be disseminated through Banksponsored seminars and/or publications. The Bank will make a special
effort Lo catalyze cooperation in areas where cooperation has been the
least bul potential benefits are subslaniial. 
In the second phase, potential projects and programs which have
regional impact will be identified. Stuches will be undertaken on such
projects and discussions will be held on problems involved to work out
possible solutions. :

In the third phase, the Bank will select and finance pilot projects a
which have strong economic rationale. In adclition to regional projects, t

national projects which have regional impact will also be considered for
lending,

While its own role is important, the Bank will coordinate with other
multilateral, bilateral, official and private organizations in promoting i
regional cooperation, In particular, the Bank will ensure that its support 8
for regional cooperation projects is consistent with the spirit of the GATT {
agreement. Although government must play ai important part, especially 7
in implemeruing necessary policy reforms, it is crucial to encourage
private sector parlicipation int regional activities, since the bulk of investments could be expecled to come from private investors. When neces-REGIONAL COOPERATION FOR DEVELOPMENT: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES,

 

sary, the Bank will use its own resources to encourage additional investments from the private sector.

It is important for the Bank that regional projects are beneficial to
concernec| DMCs regardless of the nature of their participation in the
cooperation arrangement. “Third-party” interests will be adequately
considered. As a principle, cooperation projects assisted by the Bank will
be congruent with global trade and investment liberalization trerids.

In summary, regional cooperation is an important means for the
DMCs to accelerate their economic and social development, As the
region's premier development financing institution, the Bank will seek to
promote such cooperation in any way it can. The Bank recognizes that
the new global political and economic environment offers unprecedented
opportunities for economic cooperation on a regional level. To seize
those opportunities will require quick and decisive action.

I HE WORLD economy staged a vigorous and broadbased recovery
in 1994 following slow growth for several years. All regions showed signs
af the recovery. Among the industrial countries, Australia, Canada, New
Zealand, United Kingdorn and United States performed quite well. In
continental Europe and Japan, growth also began to accelerate particularly during the second half of Ihe year. While the recovery rernained
tentative in many transitional economies, some countries in central and
eastern Europe hegan to grow after several years of declining incomes.
Among the developing regions, Asia continued to perform very well,
while growth was relatively modest in the others.

Unemployment rates remained high, particularly in Europe. Inflation
rates remained low in most industrial economies, Commodity prices
recovered strongly during the year, reversing the downward trend in the

General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) provided additional
stimulus to international trade.

Among the industrial countries, the United States grew by close to
4%, its best economic performance since 1988. The expansion was led
by capital goods investment and private consumption. Exports also
increased rapidly, benefiting from exchange rate adjustments and growth
in Canada and the countries of the European Union. Capacity utilization .
increased and unemployment fell, Monetary policy was tight throughout
the year and inflation remained low.

Japan began a slow recovery during ihe year from its severest
business downturn of the postwar era. The cycle of inventory and balance
sheet adjustments enced. GDP increased by almost 1%. Consumption
expenditure provided the major stimulus for the expansion. Spending on
durable goodls increased as significant tax cuts boosted disposable
income. Housing demand responce to low interest rates and a relaxed
monetary policy. However, plant and equipment investment remained
weak. Despite a Jarge current account surplus, external trade continued
to be a drag on the economy. Exchange rate adjustments stimulated
imports and dampened export demand.

Germany recovered strongly from recession as exports expanded
rapidly, Overall economic growth reached 2.8%. However, despite a
revival in investment spending after a negative growth in 1993, the
domestic economy remained relatively weak. Private consumption
expenditure did net show much change as wages and salaries rose only
slightly. Although fiscal policy remained tight, interest rates were lowered
in a series of steps. Money supply expanded rapidly, Unemployment
remained high, although it fell slightly toward the end of the year.

The rest of the industrial econornies of continental Europe performed well. Monelary policy was more relaxed, providing the primary
macroeconomic stimulus. Output growth was generally strong, Foreign
trade made an important contribution to lhe expansion in many countries. France and Italy grew by more thar: 2%, while the United Kingdom
registered a 3.8% growth. On the other hand, most countries faced large
budget deficits and high raies of unernploymertl, which remained intractable despite improved economic perlarmance.

The transitional economies of eastern Europe and the fortner Soviet
Union continued the process of structural adjustment which began several
years ago. Positive growth rates were recorded in some central European
economies and the Baltic states, These countries had instituted market
reforms and effectively stimulated the private sector, However, in other
economies, including Russia, the process of transition proceeded mare
slowly as output contirmed to decline and inflationary pressures persisted,

The deyeloping countries outside of Asia benefited from the rapid
growth in the industrial countries, higher commodity prices, better terms
of trade, low rates of interest and a more liberal trading environment.
The process of domestic structural and policy adjustments also enhanced
economic efficiency. Despite this, there was only a slight increase in
growth for his group of countries, conypared with the previous year.ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN DMCs

 

Overview of Developing Member Countries

With the recovery of the world economy, the Bank's developing
member countries (DMCs) improved their growth performance across the
board. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) maintained its lead with
another double-digit growth in GDP. Despite a slight cooling off of the
economy, its almost 12% growth was only slightly lower than that in
1993. Singapore also Lurned in a double-digit performance, benefiting
from continued high export demand for ils electronic products. Lao PDR,
Malaysia, Thailand and Viet Nam all achieved growth rates of 8% to 9%.
The Philippines experienced a marked recovery after several years of
slow growth due to an easing of the power crisis and a more slable policy
environment.

Reforms in South Asia began to yield positive benefits. Most economies in the subregion performed better. Pakistan, despite its continued
problems with agriculture, achieved a 4% growth. Industrial growth
accelerated in Bangladesh, India ane Nepal. The reform process in the
transitional economies of Southeast Asia continued to proceed well, thus
enhancing iheir economic performance.

Despite their problems, Mongolia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz Republic
showed signs of stability. Mongolia registered a positive growth after
several years of declining ouipul. Both Kazakhstan and Kyrayz Republic
continued to experience fairly rapid declines in output.

Inflation in the Bank's DMCs generally remained high, with only
rnarginal improvements in some of them. Among the newly industrializing economies (NIEs), Hong Kong registered the sharpest rise in price
levels. In PRC, the inflation rate rase to 22%, despite attempts to curb
overheating. In Southeast Asia, all countries except Cambodia and
Indonesia had higher inflation rates than in 1993. In South Asia,
Bangladesh was the only country which was able to attain a very low
general price level, thanks to prudent fiscal management and a very good
food grain output, Mongolia and Kyrgyz Republic recluced inflationary
pressures through concerted stabilization efforts,

With ihe upturn in the world economy ane further removal of trade
barriers, exports from most of the Bank's DMCs performed better in
1994, The augresate’ current account deficit of the DMCs declined
considerably, largely due to PRC reversing its deficit into a substantial
surplus. However, most countries experienced a deterioration in their
current account positions, The newly industrializing economies sullered
declines in their surpluses. For Southeast anct South Asian countries, the
gaps widened. The current account deficits in both Kazakhstan and
Kyrgyz Republic increased substantially, mainly as a result of the breakdown of trade links with other states of the former Soviet Union,

While Asian DMCs continued to perform well and showed an overall
improvement, intraregional differences in growth, output and per capita
income rernained, Poverty continued to be a major problem in the region
and wide disparities existed both within anc among countries.

Economic Growth

fong Kong’s GDP was estimated to have grown by 5.5% in 1994.
The sate was slightly lower than that in 1993. The construction
subsector performed well as public sector projects and infrastructure
development activities intensified, Further acceleration is expected now
that the financing package for the new airport project has been agreed
upon. There was also an increase in private sector construction activity.
However, falling domestic exports darmpened the manufacturing
subsector in the first half of the year. This was due to a combination of
factors, such as the shifting of processing activities abroad, financial
controls in PRC and continued weakness in overseas markets. Property
prices also weakened as a result of new measures introduced in the early
part of the year and rising interesl rales.

Singapore's GDP grew by about 10%, the same level ag in 1993,
All sectors, except for finance and business services, registered high
growth rates. External demand remained robust. Manufacturing, which
accounts for more than 25% of GDP, was the star perfarmer wilh a
growth rate of about 13%, Flectronic products led the sector's performance. Driven mainly by demand from the United States and Europe,
the output of the electronics industry rose by an average of 26% in the
first hall of the year. Financial and business services performed poorly,
with a growth rate of 7% compared to about 14% in 1993, mainly
because subdued equity market activities eroded margins,

The Republic of Korea experienced a marked economic upswing in
1994, Aicled by strong business investment, improved exports, recovery
of the world economy and a sharp rise in private consumption, GDP
grew by about 8.3%, compared with 5.5% in 1993. Large-scale investment in equipment played a key role in the recovery. Desplte a drought
in the summer, agricultural output expanded by almost 4%, a marked
improvement after a 2.4% decline in 1993, in manufacturing, heavy and
chemical industry continued to leact the growth in output, especially in
production for export. The services sector also improved. Real GDP
growth in Taipei,China increased slightly to 6.5%. There was strong
growth in real private investment, stimulated by relatively low interest
rales and a buoyant economic silualion. The services sector and industry
grew by aboul 8% and 6%, respectively, because of increased aclivily in
the export sector.

Inflation

Inflation in Hong Kong, based on the Consumer Price Index A, rose
ta nearly L0% in August 1994, following a declining trend since 1991.
Inflation for the whole year moderated to 8%. A weak Hong Kong dollar
and increased commodity prices led to an increase in the price of
imports, However, the inflationary pressures were offset by stable
property prices resulting from government measures to control specula

tion and a slowdown in investment fram PRC. Housing cusis rose by
about 11% during January lo August.

In Singapore, inflation was eslimated at 3.6%, partially offset by the
implementation of the 3% goods and setvi ax in April and the
appreciation of the Singapore dollar. Interest rates also rose during the
year, lagging behind increases in United States rates.

in the Republic of Korea, inflation rose from almost 5% in 1993 to
over 696 in 1994, driven by an expansion in aggregate demand and
increase in factor costs. Wages in the manufacturing sectar went tp by
close to 15%). Prices of agricultural products rose sharply because of a
severe drought. Public utility prices also increased.

In Taipei,China, inflation was estimated at 4%, about one percentage point higher than in 1993. Food prices. particularly those for fresh
fruits and vegetables, were high following damage caused by a series of
typhoons. However, continuing moderation in wage demands and
relatively softer land and properly prices helped temper inflationary
pressures to some extent.

 
 

External Sector

Hong Kong's entrepdt trade continued to benefit from PRC's trade
expansion. External trade improved significantly towards the later part of
the year, partly because of a weaker US dollar and partly because of
rapid economic growth in the United States and other trading partners.
Domestic exports and re-exports increased by about 2% and 17%,
respectively, with re-exports to PRC growing by 29%, Imports increased
rapidly, loo, by 16%, mainly fueled by extensive re-exports and imports
ol capital goods.

In Singapore, the slowdown in domestic demand caused by the
implementation of the gaods and services tax was olfset by robust growth
in external demand. The strong growth of electronics oubput in 1994 was
fully reflected in the growth of exports. Both domestic exports and reexports performed strongly. Singapore's current account surplus was
9.6% of GDP. The merchanclise trade account deficit was rnore than
offset by a large income and services account surplus. Merchandise
exports and imports both rose by an estimated 2%.

In the Republic of Korea, merchandise exports grew by more than
14% in 1994, nearly double the rate of 1993, Imports, however, grew
more rapidly than exports as domestic: demand expanded sharply. This
resulted in a significant trade cleficit, particularly with Japan. The emergence of the trade deficit, from a surplus in 1993, was the main factor
behind the deterioration of the current account balance from a surplus of
0.1% of GDP in 1993 to a deficit of 1% of GDP in 1994.

Merchandise exports from Taipei,China grew by ari estitnated 5%,
with heavy industry exports, such as machinery and electrical equipment,
having the major share. However, inyporls grew more rapidly at 9%,
contributing to the diminishing trade surplus. The current account surplus

also declined to 2.7% of GNP from 3% of GDP in 1993.

level of basic exernption remained the same. There were reductions, too,
in the profits tax and the stamp duty on certain property transactions.
Interest rate ceilings on time deposits of maturity beyond ane month were
deregulated in October 1994 which was expected to lead to an increase
in Llong Kong dollar deposit rates. As a result, some switching was
expected from foreign currency deposits into Hong Keng dollar deposits.

In: Singapore, the recent financial deregulation allows Singaporeans
to invest and raise capital abroad, opening up a pool of savings for
investment in foreign stocks and bonds. Another major policy change, to
be implemented gradually, will allow further liberalization in the use of the
Central Provident Fund resources for stock market investments.

In the Republic of Korea, various liberalization measures were
introduced in the foreign exchange market to minimize the adverse
affects of excessive capital inflows. Among other things, regulations on
capital outflows and foreign currency holdings were relaxed.

Taipei,China announced a number of fiscal policy measures. The
ceiling on the ratio of aggregate unpaid slate bonds issued to total
buelgeted government expenditure was raised from 95% to 113%.
Income tax on dividends from global depository receipts was reduced,
Tatilfs on additional items were cut.

Southeast Asia*

Economic Growth

Southeast Asia registered 4 7.5% economic growth in 1994,
compared to 6.8% in the previous year, Once again, the export sector
was the engine of growth, Domestic demand, particularly investrnent, was
also robust. The overall regional performance was influenced by a
significant improvement in the Philippine economy.

Indonesia’s growth performance exceeded the 1993 level of 6.5%.
The Govemmiertt continued to follow sound rnacroecoriomic policies and
the favorable external envirormnent helped. Expenditure growth was
broadbased. Consumption and invesinenl growlh was accompanied by a
brisk expansion of exports.

Malaysia's 8.5% growth rate was also broadly unchanged from the
previous year. The economy continued to be propelled by a rapid
expansion of exports. Beth government development expenditure and
private sector spending maintained strong growth.

The Thai economy grew by 8.5%, improving on its 1993 rate of
8.2%. Both exports and domestic demand remained strong. There was &
vigorous demand for capital goods. Government consumption demand
picked up following political changes in 1993.

‘The Philippine econorny grew by 4.3%, its highest rate in five years.
This was a substantial improvement on 1993 when GDP had recorded
only a 2% growth. Improvement in the power situation and a more stable
economic and political climate were largely responsible for the growth,
which was led by exports and investment,

Viet Nam recorded a 9% growth in GDP, against 8% in the preceding year. Although the perlonnance in agriculture was disappointing,
exacerbaled by a poor second rice crop, the energy, construction and
service sectors did well. In industry, textiles turned in a strong 14%
growth,

The economy of Lao PDR showed! a marked improvement with an
8% growth in 1994 against the previous year’s 5.9%, Growth in Cambodia accelerated to 4.9% frorn 4.3% in 1993, despite lingering political
disturbances.

Inflation

Inflation among the Southeast Asian countries rose to 6.7% from
6.3% in 1993, This was clue partly to buoyant consurnplion and investment spending in both public and private sectors, and partly to poor
harvest in some countries.

In Indonesia, strong domestic demand, the effects of drought and
disruptions in transportation accounted for an inflation rate of 8.5%, over
one percentage point lower than in the previous year.

In Malaysia, consurner price inflation rose to 3.7%, Although some
concerns about overheating of the economy remain, inflationary pressures have so far been. successfully contained.

The Philippines had a 9% inflation rate, a consequence of strong
economic recovery and large foreign exchange inflows. The appreciation
of the peso, especially in the second half of the year, did however help to
contain imperted inflation.

In Thailand, inflation edged up to 5% from 3.3% in lhe previous
year. Rising crop prices, increased demand and higher liquidily fueled by
foreign portlolio investmeril contribuled Lo Lhe acceleration.

Viet Nar, which had been able to contain inflation at 5.8% in 1993,
saw the rate go up to 9.5% as a result of its strong economic growth and
a poor second rice crop.

In Lao PDR, inflation: was slightly higher than the 6.3% in 1993 due
to continuing domestic bottlenecks. Inflation remained high in Cambodia,
partly due to lingering political uncertainties, but seemed to be on a
downward trend.

External Sector

Jn nominal US dollar terms, the ewrent account balance of the
Southeast Asian countries as a group moved further into delicit, For
some countries, however, lhe deficits as a fraction of GDP were smaller
than in previous years. In general, lhese deficits were financed by long
term capilal inflows.

Indonesia has had persistent currenl account deficits. In 1994, the
gap widened to $3.1 billion from $2 billion in the previous year. This gap
was financed by foreign direct investment and loans. While the growth of
nor-oil exports, particularly textiles, was clisappointing, the demanc for
consumer, intermediate and capital goods imports remained strong. The
trade surplus shrank from $8.2 billion in 1993 to $7.8 billion.

In Malaysia, the trace account moved into deficit for the first time
since 1982. A deficit on the service account amplified the trade deficit
and led to a currerrt account deficit of 9% of GDP. The deficit was
covered largely by long-term capital inflows,

Thailanel’s current account deficits have been consistently large as a
proportion of GDP and rose to $7.4 billion in 1994. Nevertheless, a
rapid expansion of exports has enabled Thailand to recuce ils debt-service
ratio, The country's strong export performance is based on ils international competitiveness. However, traditional exports, such as lextiles, are
now coming under increasing competition from other countries,

The Philippines has traditionally had large trade and current account
deficits. While merchandise exports grew by 18% in 1994, iraporls also
rose at 4 more rapid pace int the wake of strong GDP growth. The
curyent account deficit stood at $3 billion, representing 5% of GDP. This
was financed by remittances, foreign direct investment and portfolia
investment,

Viet Nam ran up a current account deficit of $800 million. Imports
grew strongly as a consequence of economic restructuring and fast
economic growth. The marked increase in foraign investment was able to
cover the deficit.

Trade and current account deficits were both on the rise in Cambodia ancl Lao PDR. Again, the deficits in both cases, financed by foreign
aid and loans, were linked to strong surges in imports.

 

Domestic Policies

Major policy reforms were underway in a number of Southeast Asian
countries, Significant reforms had already heen undertaken in the Philijpines, and more were expected, Lao PDR and Viet Nam continued the
process of transilion from centrally planned to market economies.
Cambodia followed the same path despite its political, problems, In
Indonesia and Thailand, reforms were pursued within the context of an
open trading systern and liberalized markets,

Malaysia was focusing mainly on downsizing the public sector and
ensuring that the economy had an adequate skill base to absorb advanced
technology and move on to higher value-added activities. The
Government's Intention was to preverit ari overheating of the economy.
Its fiscal stance, as reflected in the 1995 budget, rernained prudent. A
nurnber of modest fiscal reforms were announced. Import duties on more
than 2,600 items were abolished or reduced. Excise duties on a number
of items of importance to the transport seclor were abolished. These
measures were prompted by the desire to conlain inflation, Monetary
policy was also directed toward reducing inflation. The growth of mon
elary aggregates slowed down.

In Thailand, decentralization of economic activity continued to be a
strong theine of economic policy. Currently, Bangkok accounts for
approximately 50% of ‘Thailand's GDP, A two-pronged approach has
been adopted to correct regional imbalances. Fiscal inducements have
been provided to encourage devolution of activity to other regions, while
the private sector is encouraged to ansee take major infrastructural
improvements iri Bangkok.

Late in the year, Indonesia revised its tax laws to broaden the tax
base of its non-oil economy, The new tax measures are expected to take
effect in 1995. The coverage of value-added tax will be widened, and
both corporate and personal income taxes will be reduced. New tax
incentives will be introduced to encourage the location of industries in
remote areas of East Indonesia. A number ol other measures are plarined
to attract foreiqn investors. There was some fiscal tightening in 1994,

naminal income, In response to underlying inflationary pressures and
rising interest rates elsewhere in the world, Bank Indonesia raised shortterm interest rates on a number of accasions during the year.

Various structural reforms and sectoral policy initiatives have been
undertaken in the Philippines with a view to enhancing its competitive
ness in world markets. Foreign tracle has been liberalized, private sector
invesiment in infrastructure has been encouraged and there has been a
liberalization of the foreign investraent and foreign exchange regimes.
During the early part of the year, the banking sector was opened up to
foreign competition. The coverage of the value-added tax was extended
to the services sector, A range of incentives was introduced for investment in infrastructure. The Government pursued a cautious fiscal policy.
The fiscal deficit came to only 1% of GNP. The appreciation of the peso
also improved the Government's fiscal position. Monetary control was
tore difficult though, with large inflows of foreign, mainly portfolio,
capital, which increased the supply of liquidity, Despite this, however, the
Philippines operaied within the monetary targets agreed with the Interna
tional Monetary Fund (IMF).

South Asia*

Economic Growth

The Bangladesh economy remained stable in 1994, posting a 4.6%
GDP growth. Agriculture grew by 1.8%, the same level as in 1993. Food
grain production was adversely alfectecl by a disruption of input supplies
to some parts of the country. However, this was offset by a rise in activity
in livestock and fisheries as the Gavermmment attempted to steer credit to
these subsectors. Industry grew by 8.5% against 8% in 1993. ‘The strong
performance of small-scale private enterprises helped the manufactiuing
sector achieve a 13% growth in 1994, The services sector grew by 5.3%,
led by transport and communications, and trade, Greater mobilization of
domestic resources contributed to a significant improvernent in the fiscal
balances. After a period of stagnation, gross clomestic investment rose to
about 15% of GDP in 1994. An easing of local fund shortages, regular
monitoring of the implementation of large projects and changes in the
guidelines for project processing helped raise the level of public investtoent. Private investment, on the other harid, remained low due to
infrastructure constraints.

Bhatan’s economy posted a growth of 5.1% in 1994, about the
same as in the previous year. Output growth in the agriculture and
forestry sector declined lo 4% owing to a poor tree crop harvest and
disruption in rice production in some areas. Mainly because of continued
stagnation in hydropower generation, industrial growth remained at
5.5%, However, growth in the services sector increased at 6.1%.

GDP growth in India improved from 4.3% in 1993 to about 5.3%,
marking the revival of growth after a period of industrial recession. The

tural oulpul increased by 2.4%. Industrial production regislered a growth
of 7.6% with a strong performance in the capital goods subsector. This
was mainly altributable to the acdoplion of a more expansionary
macroeconomic policy stance. ‘lhe services sector grew by 5.7%. Its
performance was influenced by substantlal government procurement,
sustained increase in exports and trade-related activities, the recovery in
industry, and an increase in infrastructure and financial sector investment,

A spurt in agriculture and tourism pushed real GDP growth in
Myanmar to 6.4%, Agriculiural growth improved to 6.4% owing to
increased production of rice, export crops such as beans and pi ses, and
crops for industries. The services sector grew by nearly 6% as increased
tourism and foreign investment henefiled hotels and restaurants.

Maldives attained a growth rate of 5.5%, supported by rising world
prices and better utilization of fish, the country’s main export and source
of employment. Economic recovery in industrial countries combined with
expanded facilities and better promotion led to a resurgence in tourism.

Despite the adverse effects of devastating floods in duly 1993, Nepal

strong in cottage industries, construction, transport and financial services.

In Pakislan, the economic indicators Improvecl marginally despite
domestic supply shocks and an unfavorable external trade situation, GDP
growth, which had gone down to a record low of 1.9% in 1993, recovered to about 4%, nolwithslanding the weak performance of the cotton
crop because of virus and pest attacks, and shortfalls in wheat. However,
growth was still below the target set for the year, Continuing power
shortage and generally unfavorable external demand affected growth in
all sectors.

Economic growth in Sri Lanka declined at 5.7%. While tea, rubber
and caconut production did well, the rice crop was adversely affected hy
drought and floads, pulling down the growth in agriculture to 3.4%,
Export earnings improved on the strength of manufactured exports.

Inflation

Inflation in Bangladesh reriained low at about 2% in 1994, thanks
to fiscal prudence and tough demand management policies. The cost of
living index went up by 3.3% against a 2.4% decline in 1993, Broad
money supply grew by 15% despite lower public seclor requirerments and
only a moderate increase in private sector credit,

Given the ready availability of imported goods from India and
aclequate domestic agricultural output, inflation in Bhutan declined to less
than 10% from nearly 14% in 1993.

In India, the inflation rate, which had drepped to about 6% in 1993,
rose to about 11% in 1994, The increase resulted from an upward
revision in administered prices and shortfalls in the production of some
essential items, An expansionary fiscal policy also contributed to aggregate demand pressures. The Government took steps to curb the rising
trend in prices. It imposed siricler monetary control, liberalized the
imiports of essential constmer goods, and strengthened the public
distribution system.

Inflation in Maldives was 20%, while it was about 35% in Myanmar.
In Nepal, money supply was tightly contralled. The increase tn broad
money supply was held down to 20% in 1994 against over 30% in theECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN DMCs

 

previous year. However, the consumer price Index rose by about 9%,
exceeding the 8% target due to increases in food prices.

In Pakistan, inflation rose to over 12% from 9% in 1993. This was
cue mainly to the monetary overhang of expansionary policies in the past
two years and additional pressures created by increases in administered
prices.

in Sri Lanka, the restrained growth of money supply helped moderate inflation to 8.4%, ‘The major factor, however, was a reduction in the
administered prices of important consurner items and intermediate
products.

External Sector

Bangladesh's external position further improved in 1994 despite a
somewhat disappointing export performance. Exports grew by only 6%
against. 20% in the previous year, While shipments of leather goods and
frozen shrimps continued to grow, readymade garments, the country’s
leading exports, performed poorly due to a temporary disruption in the
supply of imported fabries. In addition, earnings from tea, raw jule and
jute goods exports. also fell. Import growth was nearly zero, against an
increase of 17.5% in 1993, This was mainly due to lower requirements
of food grains and petroleum products. The current account deficit. thus
shrank to 1.4% of GDP from almosi 3% in 1993. In Bhutan, a slowdown
in external trade activilies in 1994 led to a reduction in the current
account deticit to 14% of GDP from 25% in 1993, Merchandise trade
deficit coritracted significantly to $24 million, mainly because of a 22%
decline in import growth. .

in India, exports grew by about 16% during the year, while inuports,
influenced by the revival in economic activity, grew by about 21%, A
current account deficit of about $1.6 billion, less than 1% of GDP, was
recorded, against a surplus in 1993, However, this was more than
covered by large inflows on capital account, mainly in the farrn of
portfolio investment, Such inflows raised India's foreign exchange
reserves to over $20 billion.

In Maldives, exports in value terms recovered rnairily due to ar
upturn in the world prices of tuna, Imports, which were more than three
times the value of exports, also grew rapidly as a resull of increased
tourism and domestic demand. The current account deficit declined from
22% of GDP in 1993 to about 18% and was financed to a large extent
by foreign investment and grant assistance.

In Myanrnar, trade rernainecl in the deficit despite higher export
earnings, particularly [rom fisheries and garments. The current account
deficit remained below 1% of GDP,

Nepal's trade deficit worsened during the year, as an almost 33%
surge in imports far outstripped the expart growth of only 10%. Consequenily, the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP worsened to
7.7% from 6% in 1993,

During 1994, world demand for Pakistan's exports remained
depressed. Because of weak export prices, high domestic inflation aud
Increased competitiveness from other markets, exports declined by 1%.
However, imports also fell by almost 15%, reducing the trade cleficit. The
current account deticit narrowed to about 3% of GDP [rom over 6% in

Domestic Policies

Bangladesh completed @ three-year IMF-supported structural
adjustment program in 1994, which restored macroeconomic stability. At
the same time, liberalization measures were taken, which benefited
agriculture. The Government has also augmented economic reforms ina
number of areas: the role of the private sector in infrastructure development has been expanded; some state-owned enterprises have been
restructured ta improve efficiency and productivity; and trade and
exchange systems have been substantially liberalized.

in Bhutan, efforts over the past few years to strengthen tax enforcerent and broaden the revenue base have helped raise tax receipts by
about 2% of GDP. However, the tax base was stil! narrow, with currert
reverues measuring to only about 7% of GDP in 1994, Current expendilure rose more sharply than planned so that a small deficit was incurred.
Domestic financial policies remainedl pruclent. A number of steps were
laken to improve monetary management and strengthen the portfolios of
financial institutions. The exchange and trade systems had been gradually
liberalized. There were no restrictions on payments or transfers relaling
to curreril account transactions, except for large capital goods from India
and all capital and intermediate goods from third world countries.

In India, substantial progress was made curing the year in reforming
the tax struclure and in liberalizing industry, banking and finance, the
exchange rate regine, trade and foreign investment. This was one. of the
principal factors behind the growing confidence of international investors
in the Indian economy, which led to a large inflow of external capital
duwing 1994. Both direct and indirect taxes were rationalized and
progress was made toward Lhe introduction of a value-added tax. In the
financial sector, lending rates were deregulated while public sector banks
were allowed to sell fresh equity to the public up to 49% of total equity to
strengthen their capital hase. Private banks were authorized to operate
and steps were taken fo improve the regulation and operation of the
stack market. In industry, entry restriclions were further reduced for
domestic and foreign capilal. Among olher important policy developments, the exchange rate was made fully convertible on the current
account, The Reserve Bank of India adopted a move restrained monetary
policy, The Reserve Bark and the Central Governmeni reached an
agreernent on placing a ceiling on deficit monetization through the sale of
treasury bills. he Reserve Bank also introduced open-markel operations
to neutralize the impact of foreign capital inflows, which had becoine a
major source of monetary expansion,

The liscal deficit ot Maiclives rose to almost 18% of GDP from below
17% in 1993. The poor fiscal situation further recuced the effectiveness
of monetary policy in coritrofling inflation, providing credit to the private
sector, and managing foreign exchange rates and reserves. However,
efforts to expand lhe revenue base by eliminating import duty exemptions, increasing renis or government properties, introducing a property
tax on nonresidential real eslate, privatizing and recovering arrears are
expected to increase government reyenue,ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN DMCs

 

Myanmar is pursuing well-clefined financial programs to mobilize and
utilize financial resources both domestic and foreign. The reforms
implemented so far have had a tangible inypact on economic growth,
particularly in the last two years. The most notable reforms have been in
the agriculture sector, where price reform has led to real growth, and
boarder area exports which consist largely of agricultural products.

Nepal further strengthened its economic reform programs during the
year. To priovitize expenditure, a system of core projects was established
and a lhree-year rolling experiditure prograin was prepared. A system
was put in place to improve project analysis and monitoring, and review
expenditure and project implemeniation results regularly, Tax reform and
privatization measures were continued. Rules relating to licensing,
registration and access to foreign exchange were further simplified.

In Pakistan, privatization, liberalization and deregulatory measures,
initlated In 1990, were exparided and strengthened, A new concept of
public-private partnership was introduced tn the social sectors. To broadbase the privatization process, the Government encouraged the participation of the public and the employees in the acquisition of industrial assets.

Inflation

Inflation in PRC remained high at an annual rate of about 22%, This
was partly the result of upward acljustments in procurement prices of
agriculture products, It was estimated that the price reform resulted in a
more than 50% increase in retail prices of grain and almost doubled the
prices for coiton. The unification of the two-tier exchange rate system by
a 33% depreciation of the official exchange rate in early 1994 also
exerted pressure on the inflation rate.

Mongolia made considerable progress in controlling inflation,
Despite large increases in transport and communications cosis, the rate
of inflation declined from 268% in 1993 to 88% in 1994, Faced with a
rapid expansion of monetary aggregates during the first half because of
subsidized lending to public enterprises, the Government tightened
monetary policy in the second half of the year,

External Sector

PRC’s exports performed particularly well as a result of the deprecialion of the yuan and trade reforms, Exporls grew by over 30% against an
11% increase in imports. As a result, the trade balance revived from a
deficit of $10.7 billion in 1992 to a surplus of $3.4 billion in 1994, The
services sector remained healthy. The current account registered a
$4.4 billion surplus in 1994 compared with a deficit of $11.6 billion in
1993. Foreign direct investment surged by more than 35% on top of
$25 billion inflows in 1993.

Mongolia's deficit on the current account (excluding official transiers)
was about 8% of GDP, well below earlier expectations, Copper exports
grew rapidly due to robust foreign demand and higher inlernational
prices. Imports were lower than expected. The floating exchange rate
was largely siable at around Tg 400 per US dollar.

Domestic Policies

During the year, PRC unified the exchange rate, restored tax
buoyancy and imposed grealer control on budgetary revenues of the
Central Government. The unification of the exchange rate boosted
exports and attracted greater foreign direct investment. The sweeping tax
reforms introduced led to a 25% increase in revenues.

Reforms on several other fronls proceeded on schedule. To prevent
an overheating of the economy, meastues were introduced to improve
control over investment expenditures. Fixed investments were categorized
into three groups: (i} projects with social benefits to be funded through the
budget; (ii) key infrastructure projects lo be funded by the newly created
policy banks; and (ii) commercial projects lo be financed by state banks
based on commercial criteria. To improve budgelary procedures, a new
Budget Law defining the principles of budgetary management was
approved by the National People's Congress in March. A new Central
Bank Law was under preparation to establish the People's Bank of China
as an independent central bank and prechide direct goverrinent borrow
ing from it. In the area of enterprise reform, a significant step forward
was made when the Company Law caine into effect on 1 duly. The law
provides the legal basis for the establishment of limited-liabilily and
limited-shareholding companies.

As part of its continuing efforts to meet the General Agreement on
Tariffs anc Trade (GATT) requirements, PRC unveiled a timetable for
removing all quota restrictions on Imports. About 50 types of imports,
mainly capital goods, are currently subject to quota restrictions. ‘The
stated policy is to remove all quotas and licenses by 1997. On 31
December 1993, customs tariffs were recluced on 2,898 goods, reducing
the weighted average tariff rate from 22% to about 20%. GATT requires
a level of about 15% for developing countries,

In Mongolia, rnacroeconomic managernent was furlher improved,
Measures were introduced to enhance revenue collection ard control
public expenditure. To control the excessive expansion in credit and
money supply, the Government raised the minimum reserve require
ments for commercial banks and issned additional central bank bills. In
the external sector, efforts were made to diversify foreign trade and
smoothen exchange rate fluctuations.

Progress was also made towards facilitating structural reforms.
Govemment subsidies were further reduced. A new budgetary system
was established. Privatization on a cash basis was initiated. The Government also initiated a program for the restructuring or closure of insolvent
public enterprises. The enactrnent of new Jaws regarding land and
securities tracling helped create a legal envirormnent for a markel
economy. To address the growing inciclence of poverly, the Government
formulated a poverty reduction program.

Central Asian Republics*

Economic Growth

The Bank's two newest members, Kazakhstan and Kyrqyz Republic,
have faced severe economic downturns since the breakup of the former
Soviet Union in 1991, In Mazakhstan, real output declined by an estimated 34% between 1990 and 1993, all sectors being affected. GDP
contracted further by 21% in 1994, about double the decline in 1993. fn
the Kyrayz Republic, real output in 1993 was only 65% of the 1990
level. The decline continued in 1994. ‘The breakdown of trade and output
links with the lormer Soviet Union imposed a severe strain on supplies.
Shortages affected all commodiiies. The disintegration of the centralized
produclion system resulted in a scarcity of intermediate inpuis and a loss
of markets or oulpul.

Inflation

After decades of price stability, inflation has emerged as a serious
problem since 1991. Prices rose more than 30 times between 1991 and
1993 in Kazakhstan. The principal factors responsible were: (i) the
monetization of large buclget and off-budget deficits; (i) the impact of the
output contraction itself; and (ii} successive rounds of administered price
liberalization, ‘lhe high inflation eroded confidence in the curreney and
there was no inceritive to hold financial assets. I lowever, the Government
was trying hard to bring inflation down, ‘Phe situation was similar, though

slightly less severe, in the Kyrgyz Republic. High inflation there also
resulted from price reforms after 19911. It was exacerbated by expansionary monetary policies established by the former Russian authorities and
trading with the Russian ruble which was then the national currency. The
intreduction of an independent domestic currency, the som, in May
1993 was designed to give the Kyrgyz monetary authorities the ability to
sel low iriflation as a national economic priority. Through its concerlec
effort, the Government was able to lower inflation from more than
1,200% int 1993 to slightly over 280% in 1994.

 

 

External Sector

The breakdown of the former Soviel Union disrupted trade between
the yepublics and Russia. The disinantling of the ruble zone exacerbalect
the situation even further, In Kazakhslan, the current account deficit of
over $1 billion per annum during 1992 and 1993 was not sustainable
without serious extemal debt problems. The Government moved to
strengthen trade with other countries, and PRC emerged as a tracing
partner.

IMF identified an external financing gay of $450 million for
Kazakhstan in 1994. This was covered by external financial assistance
which ensured an import level necessary to contain economic contrac
tion, permitted the buildup of official reserves to 2.6 manths of imports,
and helpecl limit the domestic bank financing of the fiscal deficit to a
minvyum, There is also ar efforl to attract foreign direct investment aid
to expand trade creelits.

The Kyrayz Republic also suffered as a result of the breakdown of its
oe rs i : trade links with other states of the’ former Soviet Union. The disruption

i of the centralized system of production had a downward effect on interrepublican trade. A dramatic reduction in exporl growth, coupled with a j
high growth in imports and disruptions in service payments and transfers, ted lo a large current account deficit equal to over 8% af GDP. This i
defi 1s also financed through external assistance and trade credits.
The foreign debt problem of the Kyrgyz Republic may become fairly

Pacific island DMCs*

Economic Growth

Average GDP growth in the Pacific islanel DMCs (PIDMCs} slowed
considerably to 1.4% ire 1994 from 12% in 1993. The deceleration was
due largely to a sharp fall in Papua New Guinea's GDP growth from over
16% in 1998 to less than 1%, The country suffered an outpul decline in
the rnining and petroleum sector. Alter a gain of 6% in 1993, GDP in
Western Samoa was estimated to have fallen by about 7% in 1994,
mainly as a result of the destruction of tts principal crop, tare, through
leat blight. In Tuvalu, economic growth receded io an eslimated 2.6%
from an average of 9% per annurn in the previous lou years, The decline
resulted mainly from setbacks in agriculture (fishing) and public sectors,
which together account for more than half of the country’s GDP. In Cook
Islands, growih receded slightly to 1.5% from 1.7% in 1993. There was
some revival in housing construction and an increase in tourist arrivals’
during the first half of the year, Kiribati was estimated to have suffered a
further decline of about 0.4% in its GNP,

Fiji had a GDP growth of over 3%, with most sectors doing well.
‘Tanga had ari estimated 4.7% expansion after declines in each of the
previous two years. Much of the growth came fron the agriculture sector,
with substantially increased outputs of squash, vanilla and fish for expert,

Inflation

Corisumer price inilation, on average. accelerated slightly but
remained moderate. In Solomon Islands, rapid growth in money supply
and a depreciation of the local currency pushed up inflation from 9% in
1993 te 13%. A sharp increase frorn 2% lo 18% was noted in Western
Sainoa. A decline in taro supply coupled with changes in some acministered prices afd the introduction of a value-added goods and services tax
were mairily responsible. By contrasi, inflation was contained at 1.5% in
Fiji because of the low level of inflation in Australia and New Zealand, the
country’s main sources of imports, and more prudent fiscal and monetary
management,

 

 

External Sector

The external account position of the Pacific island DMCs in 1994
was less favorable than in the previous year. Although merchandise
imports continued to decline, exports also fell by 34% compared with a
growth of over 30% in the previous year. Again, the impact of Papua
New Guinea on the regional average was jaronounced. Against a 38%
growth rate in 1993, Papua New Guinea's exports fell by 6.3% in 1994
on account of a decline in mining activily. Imports, on the other hand,

remained at much the same level as in 1993. The trade surplus was thus
lower. The current account surplus shrank to about 5% of GDP, less than
half of what it was the year before The performance of Fiji was better. Its
current account showed a surplus of 3.6% of GDP compared with a
deficit of about 1% of GDP in 1993. Exports were strong largely as a
result of gains in sugar, timber and fish products, while there was a
marginal increase in the level of Imports, Solomon Islands recorded a
small current account surplus, against a deficit in the previous year.
Exports retnained strong, mainly on account of an unsustainable level of
harvesting of saw logs.

Domestic Policies

A number of PIDMCs reassessed their economic policies. Papua
New Guinea introduced far-reaching economic reforms to stabilize the
economy affected by loss in mineral revenue in Bougainville, natural
disaster, subsidies on tree crap exports, the overvalued exchange rate and
overdependence on the export of mining products, To bring the fiscal
deficit under control, the Government introduced substantial cuts in
expenditure in November. Reduction in external air highlighted lhe need
for structural adjustment and the development of a tradeable goods sector
in Marshall Islands and the Feclerated States of Micronesia. Solomon
Islands began to Introduce measures to accommodate future reductions in
forestry revenues. It plans to recluce its large fiscal deficit through cuis in
expenditure, expansion of the revenue base, reduction in the size of the
civil service and privatization of government commercial activities.

Generally, small populations dispersed over large areas have led to
lopsided public sectors and shortages of qualified personacl in many of
the PIDMCs. In Cook Islands, the public sector accounts for more than
half the employed workforce and about 60% of government outlays. Fiji,
the most heavily populated of the smaller PIDMCs, faces a shortage of
professional and skilled labor and deteriorating social services, partly cue
to heavy emigration since 1987. In Vanuatu, shortage of qualified
persoanel at virtually all levels in the Government continues to limit its
capacity lo absorb investment resources provided through external
assistance, For the PIDMCs as a group, capacity building and export
diversification remain key challenges.

Outlook for 1995

The outlook for the warld ecanomy, projected to grow by 2.7% in
1995, will largely depend upon the strength of the expansion in inclustrial
countries. All industrial countries are expected to be in the expansion
phase in 1995, As a group, these countries will grow by 2.9%, which will
be their strongest economic expansion in nearly a decade. Most inclividual
counties will grow between 2% and 3.5%, Germany and United States
are both expected to have a 3% growth. A 1% growth ts forecast for
Japan.

‘This is good news for the rest of the world economy. Rapid growth
in the industrial countries will bring with it robust international trace,
higher comrnodity prices and improved terms of trade for exporters of
primary products. While there is expected to be some increase in interest
rales, itilationary pressures are likely to rernain low, particularly in view

of low rates of capacity utilization in several industelal countries and high
unemployment rates in Europe.

Prospects for the developing econamies wil! depend upon the
effectiveness of comestic structural adjustment and macroeconomic
policies. In Latin America, the difficulties faced by Mexico early in 1995
point to the importance of rnaintaining fiscal discipline. However, it is not
anticipated that this episode will have a lasting adverse irupact on economic growth in Latin America or in other developing regions. Africa will
benefit frora firmer commodity prices and from siruclural adjustrnent ard
macroeconomic policies. A more peaceful political environment will
encourage a more rapid economic growth in West Asia. Among the
countries in transition, there are bright spots in the Baltic republics and
central Europe, and the stronger performances of western European
economies will provide further stimulus. The adjustment process in Russia
and many other countries of the former Soviet Union will be affected by
problems in establishing a viable legal, regulatory and aclministrative
apparatus,

The outlook for the Bank's DMCs continues to look good. However,
there will be some levelling off in growlh rates for most countries in the
region. On average, the NIl’s are expected to have a slight reduction in
their growth in 1995, The economies of Southeast Asia will perform at
about the same level. The exception will be Cambodia and Philippines,
which are expected to coritinue to improve their performance. Policy
reforms will continue lo strengthen the South Asian economies, although
their performance will lag behind that of ihe rest of the continent. |

The NIEs

Among the NIEs, Hong Kong will gain from a better global environment, A healthier investment climate in PRC should benefit Hong Kong
as a facilitator of foreign investment. lis financial services and real estate
subsectors will gain in particular. Implementation of major infrastructure
projects started in 1994 and continued expansion of the services sector
should boost employment, which will benefit the retail sector. Sustained
growth is likely to continue.

Singapore fs expected to achieve a 9% growth ir, 1995. Growth in
the Republic of Korea will continue to be driven by private consumption,
but will move at a slower pace as investment and exports gradually
decline. Prospects for Taipei,China in the next few years will largely
depend on the extent of recovery in the world econorny and on the
progress of industrial restructuring under the courilry’s Six-Year National
Development Plan. lis GDP is projecled Lo grow by about 7%, slightly
higher than in the previous year.

Inflation in Hong Kong is projecied to remain at about 8%. A
combination of factors like strong economic growth, a firm yen, a stable
yuan and a weak US dollar (to which the Hong Kong dollar is linked) will
exert the inflationary pressure. The growth of broad money supply is
expected to accelerate slightly. In Singapore, a 3% inilation is projected
for 1995 following the slight increase ir, 1994 due to the implementation
of the goods and services tax. The Republic of Korea is expected to
maintain a nonmonetary stance. The growth of broad money supply is
targeted to be held between 12% and 15% through a tightening of
domestic credit supply. Inflation is projected to stay at its 1994 level.
Inflation in Taipei,China is projected to rernain in the 3% to 496 range in

increased availability of imported inputs and credit for the private sector.

The mediurn-term outlook for Bhutan is fairly optimistic. The
completion of the ferro-silicon plant in late 1994 will boost manufacturing
output and help raise GDP growth to 7% in 1995. Exports will continue

56Operational Priorities

HE developrnent objectives and thematic priorities discussed in this
chapter reflect the Bank's growing preoccupation wilh social sectors
while retaining ils ernphasis on integrated, growth-oriented projects.

While the Bank recognizes that economic growth remains essential
to the region's development, it is aware of the many socioeconomic and
environmental problems the region continues to face.

Income and quality-of-life gaps between men and women, between
and within urban and rural populations, between landowners and the
lanclless, and between the employed ancl the unemployed continue to be
substantial anc to widen in many parts of the region. Of the more than
1 billion poor people in the developing world, between 700 million and
800 million are in Asia. About 500 million of them live in absolute
poverty.

Poverly, high population growth and rapid rates of industrialization
and urbanization have aggravated environmental degradation, Such
degradation includes deloreslalion, related soil erosion, desertification,
Joss of biodiversity, global warming, toxic and hazardous wastes, and
urban pollution. The policy of the Bank is to confront the issues of
poverty, papwation growth and environmental protection while helping
DMCs promote economic growth,

 

 

Future Direction and Operational Agenda

The Bank’s Medium-Term Strategic Framework (1995-1998) sets
out an expanded role and operational agenda for the Bank over the
mediurn term, instead of merely financing projects, the Bank will offer its
borrowing member countries an integrated package of development
services, linking project financing with policy review, capacity building
wil regional cooperation. This realignment of position is considered
appropriate in Lhe conlext of the changing roles of governments and the
private sector in DMCs.

Increasingly, DMC governmerils perceive themselves less as principal
providers of development finance and more as calalysts, promoters and
regulators af development. Correspondingly, the private sector is being
encouraged to play a bigger role. However, governments continue to be
responsible for creating conditions conducive to the development of the
private sector.

‘The realignment of the Bank's role is also prompted by the evidence
that the impacts of development investments are, in large measure,
contingent on the quality of the policy framework and the capacity of
governments to implernent and manage these investments,

The Bank will support governments in their efforts to create coridlitions necessary for private sector-led development. It will continue to
finance development projects, particularly in the physical and social
infrastructure sectors. In addition, there will be a growing emphasis on

strengthening policy and capacity frameworks in key sectors,

In the area of regional cooperation, the Bank will work to promote
interaction arnong the economies of the region. This interaction will
potentially cover facilitation of tracle and investment, coordination of
macroeconomic policies, mutual recognition of technical standards.
complementary environmental policies and cooperation in the maragement of convnon natural resources. Bank activities in this regard are
described in gveater detail in a separate chapter,

 

Country Focus

In implementing its stralegic prioritias, the Bank will sharpen its
couritry focus. The Bank is aware that considerable cillerences exist

 

among DMCs in terms of their levels of development, needs, constraints }
and priorities. Even within inclividual couniries, different seclors and :
geographic areas may differ considerably in the type of assistance t

required to foster development. By placing their needs at the center ol all
its operations, the Bank should be able to strengthen its partnership wilh
its DMCs. This should further improve project performance.

The country approach requires the Bank's departments and offices
to better coordinate their activities, so that Bank operations result in a
balanced portfolio of lending anc technical assistance over the medium
term. Country operational strategy studies anc country operational
programs reflect these efforts and guide Bank operations accordingly.
‘They seek to identify the Bank's distinctive rale in each DMC. Country
operational programs are now prepared in line with planning clrections
issued by the President every year, and reinforce the strategic directions
of Bank operations in the DMCs. They provide for an appropriate mix of
growth. social and environmental projects.

Bank activities in this area
are described in the
following sections on Social Dimensions and Social Infrastructure. Several
Bank projects primarily aimed at promoting economic growth have
significant social or environmental implications, such as the irrigation
management activities in Indonesia, Nepal and Pakistan. or the YunnanSimao Forestation Project in PRC.

A classification of Bank projects by overall objective is presented in
the accompanying table,

Social Dimensions

Two factors have spored the Bank inlo paying greater altenlion to
the social cimerisions of development. First is Ure fact thal, despite the
relatively rapid economic growth in the Bank's region as a whole, poverty
persists in many of its DMCs, Second is an awareness that the participalion by people is essential for sustained economic growth. There is
increasing recognition that people should he af the center of develop:
ment, atid clevelopment shauld be for all people.

The Bank's social concerns have been Incorporated in its oparations
through a range of policies, guidelines and instructions to staff. Following
the publication of the Bank's Guidelines for Incorporation of Social
Dimensions in Bank Operations in 1993, a Handbook for Incorporation af Social Dimensions in Projects was published in 1994 for the
quidance of Bank stali, staff of executing agencies and consultants,

Four specific but closely interrelated social dimensions have been
identified in this-respecl: poverty reduction, women in developrnent,
human resource developinent (incleding population planning), ard
protection of vulnerable groups from aclverse effects of development!
interventions.

Poverty Reduction: Poverty rechiclion remains the most formidable developrnent challenge facing DMCs and the Bank. The Bank's
response is to fund projects that create employment and generate
income; encourage policies pertinent to ernployment and income
generation, and expand the access of the poor to health, family planning.

Enhancing Women’s Role
in Indonesia.

I N LATE 1993, the Bank approved
a technical assistance grant for institu
tional strenglhening of Indonesia's
State Ministry for the Role of Wornen.
The ministry is responsible for preparing and formulating overall government
policies and plans to enhance the role
of women in development. li coordinates all sectoral policies and activities
for this purpose.

The objectives of the assistance
are to strengthen the ministry's
capacity to mainstream women’s
concerns in all sectoral policies, plans
and programs. The project will assist in
the development of a medium-term
strategic plan in the context of national
development plans. Also, an action
program to address women's issues will
be developed.

 

 

Addressing the Poverty Problém

The program has brought about
a variety of policy reforms designed
to ensure a sustatnable development
of marine resources. Bills have been
filed in the National Congress to
enact a Fisheries Code. In acldition to
actual work to improve coastal
resources — coral reefs, mangrove
forests and coastal shelves - the
program has increased awareness at
alt levels of the importance of
conservation, résource management
and responsible development.

The program has improved
incomes and living standards of
individuals in poor fishing
communities. Preliminary evaluation

specifically at small farmers, Jandless laborers, marginal fisherfoll, upland
cammunities, and the urban and rural poor.

Bank loans and technical assistance address ihe poverty problem in a
variety of ways. Virtually every Rank project has a poverty recluction
element, directly or indirectly. Projects in areas such as agriculture, rural
development and social infrastructure address the prablern directly
through the creation of new economic opportunities and the improvement of social and infrastructure services. The Fisheries Sector Pragram
in the Philippines is an example of such projects (see box}. Projects that
provide credit to microenterprises also help reduce poverty, as the
Microcredit Project for Wornen in Nepal shows.

moting policies and projects that help women enhance their economic
and social status, expand their contribution to the economy and share the
rewards of development as equal partners. Despite the region’s rapicl
econornic development, inequalities faced by wornen sometimes remain
marked. In some countries, for example, literacy rates arnong women are
below 20%. fi many courrlries, women have lower social, economic and
polilical slatus.

The Bank's policy is to integrate gender considerations into all
aspects of its operations. Gender analysis is now part of country operational strategies and programs. Accordingly, women-in-development
country profiles are regularly prepared. Concerns about women were
addressecl specifically in the country operational strategy stucly for
Indonesia prepared during the year. A number of ongoing projects
provide microcredit for women, support female education and offer
family planning and health services for women. The Women’s Health and
Safe Motherhood Project in the Philippines, approved in 1994, is
targeted at women exclusively. —

With training and new skills, women
will be able to gain new remunerative
employment or start thelr own small
scale entefprises, Credit will be
provided to women who have
received appropriate skills training for
activities such as agricultural procluction and running small businesses.

PRIORITIES AND POLICIES

NGOs will be strengthened so that
they can act as effective financial
intermediaries in the provision and
supervision of credit,

It is expected that about
20,000 women will benefit from
the skills training and microcredit
components of the project. The
project is expected to have a direct
impact on the developtnent of
efféctive systems to promote
coordinated public and private
sector services, These, in iurn, wilt
boost agricullural preduction and
promote cottage and agroindustries, reducing poverty and
increasing self-reliance.

 

n-development and

investment in human resources, including population planning, is a vital
part of development. The Bank believes that if services and facilities in the
health and population, education, water supply and sanitation, and urban
and rural development areas are upgraded, skills, living standards and the
quality of life of people will improve. This will help expand individuals’
contributions loward sustained economic growth.

| lunan resource development was a major focus of the Bank’s 1994
lending tor social projects. Of ten social sector loans approved during the
year, nine reflected a direct concern for hurnan resource development.
Specific activities in this respect are discussed in the section or Social
Inrastructure,

Protection of Vulnerable Groups: Vulnerable groups include
children, indigenous and Gibal people, ethnic minorities, illegal settlers
and squatters, disabled persons, new and old immigrants, and people at
the battom of the sncineconomic ladder. Usually poor, such people are
unable te abserb the economic, environmental and social shocks that
development may entail. It may often be necessary to provide social
safety nets and compensation mechanisms to protect vulnerable groups
from such shocks,

The Bank pays special attention to needs of vulnerable groups
affectect by development projects. The objective of its involuntary
resettlement policy is to ensure that people displaced by a development
intervention also receive social anc economic benefits hom projects. For
indigenous ancl tribal people, such benefits should also be compatible to
their culture.

Social Infrastructure

In view of the Bank's increased emphasis on social sectors, a new
pipeline of projects was put together during the year to beller respond to
social goals and policies, The pipeline, extending over the next two to
three years, includes projects in Cambodlia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan,
Mongolia, Pakistan, Philippines, StiyLanka and Thailand. These projects
will seek to improve basic, secondary and higher education, rehabilitate
basic skills, strengthen technical and vocational training. develop science
and technology personnel, and support population planning.

In achieving its social sector goals, the Bank takes note of the specific
socioeconomic conditions of a DMC and draws on its accumulated
experience, The objectives are (i) to sustain long-term growth anc procductivity, (ii) to make selective interventions Lo induce development, and {ii} Lo
provide security and welfare for vulnerable groups.

Institutional development and capacity building are regarded as
particularly important to achieving social sector goals. As the Financing al
Social Services project in Viet Nam shows, ihe Bank is also concerned
about ensuring the financial viability of social sector policies and projects.
Among olher projects that reflect such concerns are those for the InstituHonal strengthening of the State Education Commission in PRC and for
human resource development in the health sector in Papua New Guinea.
Regional cooperation and the sharing of experiences among DMCs have
been identified as an effective way to transfer capacily-building knowhow,

The Bank's objectives with regard to specific social subsectors are as
follows:

Education: The Bank net only supports physical expansion of and
equitable access lo educational services, but also seeks to improve their
quality and relevance. Primary ane nonformal education is mere wsingly
amuphasized to boos! Jileracy and women’s education. The focus is more
on institutional and cwriculun development than on physical facilities. To
achieve these ends, the slrengthening of DMC institutions in sectoral
analysis, planning and management of education is emphasized. The
education: master plan developed with Bank support in’ Mongolia, the
sector resource study undertaken in Papua New Guinea and the regional
study on secondary education reflect the Bank's strategic considerations.
Two technical assistance grants were provided to PRC for capacity
building and hurnan resource development

The regional study on secondary education highlighted the imporlance of policy analysis. It identified a number ol issues related to financing, quality, access and efficiency. A consullalive seminar was held,
involving 13 countries, to apprise. educational policymakers in DMCs of
these issues.

Health and Population: The Bank’s main objective in the health
and population subsector is to improve the equity, accessibilily, quality
and efficiency of prirnary health care as well as referral and family
planning services, particularly in remote rural areas. Bank assistance is
largely concentrated on preventive and primary health services; safe
motherhood and women's health; contre! of communicable diseases: arid
integration of health activities into a larger package of services promoling
family planning. nutrition and community development

A population policy was approved in July, setting out the directions
of the Bank's activities in this area. The policy endorses a three-pronged

 

 

 

  
 

 

 

 

 

3PRIORITIES AND POLICIES

 

strategy for the Bank, First, assistance will be provided to reduce gender
disparities in school enrolment, since educated wornen are the rriosl
persistent advocates of small family. Second, altention will be paid to
safeguarding women's reproductive health, since sale pregnancy and
childbirth are seen as precursors to fertility decline. Third, efforts will be
supporied lo make access to family planning services equitable, The
Bank’s policy was presented at the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo during the year.

The technical assistance provicled to Cambecia to prepare a project
to improve basic health services reflects some of the Bank’s concerns in
this subsector. Sector work, loan projects and technical assistance grants
approved in 1994 emphasized the inyportance of women’s health, supply
of essential drugs, early childhood development, reproductive health care
and health financing. Signifying its commitment to improving health
services for children and young mothers, the Bank approved the
Women’s Health and Safe Motherhood Project in the Philippines, ils first
project solely supporting the health and weil-being of women. The
Population and Family Planning Project in Papua New Guinea represented the Bank’s increasing involvement in the area of population.
Regional technical assistance covered such broad themes as health reform
and the role of the private sector in providing health services.

Water Supply and Sanitation: The Barik favors an integrated
approach ta the use and conservation of water resources for human
consumption. The major goals of this subsector are to provide for
adequate, reliable and safe supply of potable water and for effective
sartation facilities and wastewater clisposal. These objectives stem from
the need to safeguard public health, veduce poverty, develop human
resources and enhance the quality of the environment, The two projects
approved during the year ~ Dalian Water Supply Project for PRC (see
box) and Chonburi Water Supply Project in Thailand - reflected these
objectives, ,

Recently, the Bank convened a regional consultation on managing
water resources to meet the needs of megacilies. Since water requirements in megacities exceed available resources. il was felt desirable to
adopt a comprehensive managemerit plan base on a river basin unit.

The consultation called for increased efforts fo assess the economic
and financial costs of managing water clemancd, While econamic costs
should include environmental and opportunity costs, investment cost
arialyses should include both public and private expenditure. It was
suggested that future demand should be met through reduction of water
losses, dernand management. reallocation of use, reuse of wastewater
and development of new sources. Governments were asked to make clear
statements on tariffs. Water utililies were aclvised to operate as commercial entities,

Urban Development and Housing: Many of the Bank's DMCs
are experiencing the problem of rapicl urbanization, a resuli of their
dynamic economic growth. In some cases, the rate of urban growth, and
hence the danand for services, is outstripping the capacily of existing
infrastructure and the abilily of smmicipal authorilies to umprove Iacilities.
In addition to developing the physical infrastructure to meet basic needs.
improve living conditions and protec! the environment, the Bank places
considerable importance. on enhancing urban areas’ contribution to
economic growth. This is sought to be achieved by strengthening national
and local government agencies responsible for urban planning and

Environmental Priorities and Policies

The goal of the Bank's environment program is Lo promote environmentally sound and sustainable development in its DMCs, The immediate
objectives are to increase the share, of enviroumental projects in Bank
aperations, minimize any likely adverse environmental impacts arising
from its projects and programs, and establish mechanisms to make
development sustainable over the long term.

The Bank expects that environmental impact assessment (EIA)
reports prepared by ils DMCs are of a high quality. Under its new policy
on disclosure of information, the Bank will ensure that summary ElAs
and inilial environmental examination reperls on sensitive projects are
made available to Interasled parties on request. Conments from concerned groups-will be given adequate attention. Where apprepriate,
these will be incorporated into project design.

Finding financial resources for environmental investment projects is
a major Bank concern, Such projects are intended to help prevent i
pollution and the degradation of natura) resources, The Bank will :
formulate action programs to raise public awareness and build up the :
environmental management capacily of its DMCs. Institutional, legal aru
regulatory frameworks will be further reviewed, developed and strength
ened te promote programs to prevent or contral pollution.

|PRIORITIES AND POLICIES

 

In the area of capacity building, the focus will be on improving
environmental planning and management, policy analysis and formulation, and the preparation, implementation and monitoring of envirenmental aspects of projects

‘Two policy issues will receive increasing attention from the Bank.
First, pollution prevention will be aclopted as the major approach to
arresting environmental degradation. Second, an integrated regional
development planning approach will be taken in identifying potential
projects and programs. Such an approach will take account of environmental parameters right from the very beginning,

Country operations will be made more focused and analytical.
Country operational slrategy sludies will be prepared at grealer depth to
make assistance lo DMCs move effeclive. Environmental irrputs will be
provided in support of the policy, capacity-building and regional cooperation agenda of the Bank in respect of its DMCs

The Bank will also promote cooperation with regional, international
and noi-governmental organizations (NGOs), including the media, to
promote its environmental interest. Common concerns of DMCs in
implementing national programs under the global environmental action
plan, known as Agenda 21, will continue to be addressed.

Cooperation with NGOs

hi line with the social orientation embodied In its strategic objectives,
the Bank emphasizes cooperation with NGOs in ils operational activities,
Many of ils poverly reduction, human resource development arc women
in-development activities have included direct NGO involvement

The Bank believes that, having direct knowledge of local communities, NGOs can share expertise with the Bank and with governments in
identifying, preparing, implementing, moniioring and evaluating projects.
They can be particularly useful in identifying and avoiding potential
problems.

Project and policy consultations between NGOs and the Bank are an
important feature of the Bank’s annual meetings. During the year, NGO
inputs were sought in the development of a number of sector and
operational policy papers. A review of the Bank's cooperation with
NGOs was undertaken to update its overall policy in this regard. Work
conticwed on the development of a database on NGQs in the region, with
more than 2,000 NGOs already included in the Bank's roster,

Improving Project Quality

The in-house. Task Force on Improving Project Quality, sel up in
1993, submitted its report to the President in January. Three major
themes ran through the report's findings and recommendations,

The first theme was that the Bank neecled to pay greater attention to
local needs, demands, absorptive capacity and project preparation and
implementation. [t also meant that the Bank should strengthen the
country focus of its operations. Links between economic and sector work,
prograrnming and project design should be improved and lessons learnt
frorn ils experience over the medium term should be incorporated.

The second theme was that the Bank needed to pay greater atten

tion to the development of institutional capacity In its DMCs and to foster
their commitment to Bank assisied projects. This meant thai the Bank
needed to develop stronger anc longer-term programs in DMCs and
involve DMC officials arid beneficiaries at al! stages of the project cvele.

The third therne was that lhere shoull be more accountability within
the Banik for erisuring project qualily. This meant hat project implemenlation should in future be given the same priority as project processing,
that Bank systems and procedures should be more decentralized to allow
for greater flexibility andl initiative, and that feedback on the lessons of
past experience should be batter utilized in the design and implementa:
tion of projects and programs.

The key recommendations of the report were drawn together in an
action plan. While some recommendations required further study, others
were implemented during the year. Specifically, a prelimimary project
brief was introduced to encourage greater attention fo macroeconomic
and sectoral aspects of projects. A new normative project processing
period was adopted to enhance quality. Greater emphasis was placed on
the use of the logical project framework. The format of a project adrninistration memorandum was designed to clarify the respective roles of the
Bank, governments and beneficiaries during project implementation. ln
cooperation and consultation with DMC govermnents, a review was
undertaken of country portfolios to restructure certain projecls for the
sake of cost-elficiency or weed oul peorly-perforining ones. The exercise
helped identify remedial actions thal the Bank and DMC executing
agencies could take to improve Lhe implernentation of poorly performing
projects. The framework of an annual performance evaluation program
was also prepared. This will bring together activilies throughout the Bark
related to project performance, ancl will form the for better integra:
lion of lessons learned into future operational activities.

A number of working groups were set up during the year lo examine such matters as the possibility of delegating more. project implementation responsibility to resicent offices; to review the Bank’s business
practices for the sake of greater efficiency and accountability; and to
expand project completion reports to provide for initial assessments of
project impact. An internal reorganization of the Bank, effective from
January 1995, will enhance the country focus of its activities.

A workshop on improving project quality was held in Noveniber,
with representatives of almost all the Bank's borrowing couritries attending. The workshop provided an opportunity for the DMCs to discuss the
implementation of the Task Force report, and resulted in an agenda for
action.

The agenda complements the Bank's own action plan and in many
respects mirrors the Task Force findings. An important overall theme that
emerged from the workshop is the need for greater support from the
Bank to expand DMCs’ capacity for economic and sector work as well as
for project formulation, implementation and evaluation,

 

Support for Capacity Building

The Bank has identified capacity building for development management as an operating objective directly linked to achieving economic
growth, reducing poverty, improving the status of women, developing
human resources and protecting the environment.

ca ee at a Ot a,PRIORITIES AND POLICIES

 

 

During 1994, a substantial portion of the Bank’s advisory technical
assistance effort was devoted solely to building capacity in DMCs. Several
loans also had similar components. An example was the capacity building
project in the water resources subsector in Indonesia. In the Pacific island
DMCs, capacity building is at the center of Bank operalions. Legal
workshops were organizecl in Kathmandu, Phnom Penh, Vientiane, Port
Vila, Hanoi and Beijing as part of the Bank's ‘Law and Development’
activities. The subjects discussed at these workshops included
privatization, banking law, negotiation of international contracts and legal
training.

In geneyal, the Bank’s capacity-building support to DMCs will be
focused on three broad areas: (i) capacity for policy analysis, formulation
and impact asseasment, (ii) public sector reform and the strengthening of
public administration; and (ii) government capacity to create an environment conducive to the private sector

Participatory Approach to Development

The report of the Task Force on Improving Project Quality underscored the need to enhance the sense of ‘ownership’ of projects on the
part of DMCs and beneliciaries. The Bank realizes that their roles in
programriing, planning and implementing projects can have a major
impact on the qualily, impact and sustainability of these interventions.
The Bank particularly recognizes the role of local consultative groups.

Under the guidelines for incorporation of social dimensions in Bank
operations, social analyses are undertaken during the preparation and
implementation of projects, and participatory cevelopment processes are
incorporated, Several loans and technical assistance projects reflect this
participatory appraach, such as the Khulna-Jessore Drainage Rehabilitation Project in Bangladesh, the Irrigation Management Transter Project
in Nepal, the Applications for Strengthening Cornmunity and Local
Government Participation Project in the Philippines and the Third
Livestock Development Project in Nepal.

A staff workshop on the incorporation of participatory approaches
into Bank operations was held in November.

Aid Coordination

The Bank cooperates actively with multilateral and bilateral aid
agencies lo ensure Lhat scarce clevelepment resources are used in a
coordinated manner. During 1994, it worked closely with major donors
to promote macroeconomic stabilization in DMCs like Kazakhstan,
Kyrayz Republic, Mongolia and Solornon Islands. Reports and prograniming documents are shared in respect of a variety of sectors, including
agriculture, education, energy, industry, transport and communications,
and urban clevelopment.

The 16th ADB-World Bank coordination meeting was hell in May in
conjunction with the Bank’s 27th Annual Meeting in Nice, France. In
October, the President attencled the meeting of the Development
Committee and heads of multilateral financial institutions in Madrid in
connection with the meetings of the World Bauk and IMF

(DMCs). The Bank's ecjuity operations, which beqan in 1983, reached a
cumulative total of $290 million in direct investments ancl underwriting
commitments

Technical Assistance

During 1994, the Bank provicled technical assistance grants for 291
projects, amounting to $129 million (an increase of 6% from 1993). The
amount inchuded $27 million fer regional activilies. Technical assistance
components of loans amounted to $195 million (a decrease of 51% from
a year age).

Twenty-nine of the Bank's 1994 loans, involving an amount of
$2,238 million, resulted from earlier technical assistance projects. Of this,
$1,848 million was fram OCR and $390 million from ADF,

The Bank's technical assistance is financed through grants, or loans,
or a combination of both. Grants are funded from voluntary contributions
to the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF} by both developed and
developing member countries, regularized allocation to TASE fromm ADF
VI, TASF income, reflows from reimbursable. technical assistance, annual
transfer of OCR net incorne to TASF where necessary, annual contributions received from the Japan Special Fund (JSP) and grants from
multilateral and bilateral sources (under co-financing and exclusive
financing arrangements), The latter include the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the governments of Australia, Denmark,
Finland, France, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland,

The Government of Japan made its seventh-year contribution to the
JSP in 1994 amounting to a total of ¥9.87 billion ($100.1 million), This
ivicluded a supplementary amount of ¥2.268 billion, which was allocated
to support activities related to environmental protection {¥1.3 billion),
women in development (¥250 million), promotion of the privale seclor
(¥693 million) and seminars and symposia (¥24.916 ruillion).

During the year, the governments of Australia and France made

projects. Australia cottumilted A$ 200,000 for the 1994/1995 financial
year, while France offered FF30 million per year for 1994 and 1995,
The contributions were made available as untied grants, with the Bank
acting as administrator of the funds.

In addilion, Switzerland agreed to utilize the remaining balances
identified under Swiss grants J, (| and Ill amounting to approximately
$980,000. This amount. which also inclucled some savings from investments earned thereon, was aimed at financing Phase Il of the Regional
Community Forestry Training Center in Bangkok.

Review of Operations

Lending in the public sector during 1994 declined in both volume
(27%) and number of loans (29%) from the previous year, This was
largely due to the Bank’s efforts to consolidate its lending program and
spend more tirne to further improve the quality of projects. The Bank
also took a harder look at the absorptive capacity of some of its borrow:
ers,

During the year, the Bank approved its first loans to Kazakhstan and
Kyrayz Republic as special assistance lo these countries, Emergency loans
for disaster rehabilitation were approved for Indoriesia and Papua New
Guinea.

The average size of the year’s loans to the public sector was
$75 million, against $76 million in 1993,

A review of the year’s lending ancl technical assistance operations by
sector follows:

 

Agriculture and Agro-Industry: Bank operations In the agriculture and agyo-industry sector cover the broad areas of agriculture, natural
resource managernent and rural development. In agriculture, the objective
is lo promote productivity, exports, economic efficiency, diversification
and sustainable agricultural practices. In the area of natural resource
management, the objectives are to introduce, institutionalize and
strengthen strategies thal promote conservalion arid protect the environment. The primary focus in rural development is on rural infrastructure,
rural employment, poverty reduction, improvement of the status of
women and enhancement of the quality ol life.

Lending to the agriculture and agro-induslry seclor increased by 35%
during the year to $486.4 million for 11 projects in eight DMCs (see
accompanying table). Two DMCs = Indonesia and Viet Nam - accounled
for over 60% of it.

Altogether, 45 technical assistance grants totalling $23 million were
also approved. Of these, 16 were for project preparation and 29 were
advisory and operational in nature.

Of the 11 loan projects approved in 1994, one - the Agriculture
Seclor Prograrn in Viet Nam — was focused solely on economic growth.
Two proijecls, the Pearl Industry Development Project in Cook islands and
the Capacily Building Project in the Water Resources Sector in Indonesia,
had human resource development as the primary objective. The remaining eight projecis had poverty reduction as the strategic development
objective. In addition to poverly reduction, ore project had the premetion
of the status of women and another had environmental protection as
secondary objectives

Natural resource management remained a major focus of activities in
the agriculture and agre-inclustry sector. Development and management
of water resources was addressed uneler the Second Integrated Irrigation
Sector Project and the Capacity Building Project in the Water Resources
Sector in Indonesia; Red River Delta Water Resources Sector in Viet

were adelressed by the Yurinan-Simao Ferestation and Sustainable Wood
Utilization projects in PRC,

All agriculture projects incorporated social dirnensions in addition to
specific concems,’ Infrastructure development was the objective of the
Fisheries Infrastructure Improvernent Project i Malaysia and the Rural
Infrastructure Developrnent Project in the Philippines. Both projects sought
to reduce poverty. The Microcredil Project in Indonesia was aimed at
providing access to credit for the poor, particularly women, The Bank
made its first program loan for Viet Nam's agriculture sector. It sought to
develop a policy environment that would sustain economic growth ancl
increase the efficiency of the agriculture and agro-processing sector,
strengthen rural financial intermediation ancl enhance soclal equity,

Several in-house initiatives ware taken to enhance project quality in
the agriculture and agro-industry sector, The ‘logical project framework’
was Widely used In preparing projects. Studies were initlated to revamp
the Bank's policies with regard to forestry, fisheries, Jivestocl, crops, rural
finance, water resource development and agricultural research, ‘The
objective was to relate these activities more closely to the vegion’s
evolving development priorities, as reflected in the Bank's Medium-Term
Strategic Framework.

Energy: The Bank continued to promote fuel civersificalion,
environmental improvernent and substitution of oil by indigenous and
renewable energy. It also pursued least cost planning, construction aid
operation of energy systems, pricing reforms and measures to make
energy utilities operationally autonomous and financially viable. Institutional assistarwe was provided to strengthen demand management,
expand subsector restructuring and encourage privatization. Improvement
of energy efficiency also received attention.

Loans tolallitig $885 million were made int 1994 for eight projects.
All the projects weie in the electric power subsector. Two of therm were
in PRC -- one for a cogeneration plant coupled with the expansion of
district heating facilities at Qitaihe, and the other for a large hydropower
scheme in Hunan province. There were also two projects in Lao PDR one to finance the cost overrun of Nam Noum-Luang Prabang Power
Transmission Project and the other for the Theun-tHinboun | lydropower
Project, a joint venture between the Government and foreign partners, A
project was approved for Indonesia to expand the power supply network
in Sumatra and develop the low-cost hydropower potential of East Tunor
and South Kalimantan. Expansion of transmission and distribution
networks was the focus of a project approved for Pakislan, while rehabilitation of the power system was the focus of one in Cambodia. Mongolia
received a loan for the rehabilitation of power and heal-generating
facilities in Ulaanbaatar.

‘Twenty-tive technical assislarice grants, amounting to over
$11 roillion, were also approved. Nine of them were for project preparation and 16 were for advisory purposes. The grants reflected the Bank’s
emphasis on environmental improvement, development of build-operateown (BOO) and build-operate-transter (BOT) concepts, efficiency of
energy supply and demand, and subsector restructuring andl privatization.

 

Finance: Jn the financial sector, the Bank seeks the liberalizalion of

 

 

tfinancial regimes, restructuring of banking systems, adoption of prudential norms and sound banking practices, and stronger regulation and
supervision. The Bank supports measures to deepen and broaden capital
markets, reduce intermecliation costs and build the support infrastructure,
e.g.,the reguiatory framework; enforcement and surveillance systems;
credit rating agencies; aru! clearing, settlement and depository systems.

One loan of $75 million was approved for the financial sector during
the year. This was the Fourth Development Finance Loan project in Sri
Lanka, Designed as an umbrella credit line to the Government, the
amount will be relent to nine private financial institutions to finance foreign
currency investments of private enterprises in manufacturing, services and
tourism, For the first time, funds will be channeled salely through private
financial intermediaries, all of which are listed ov the Colombo Stack’
Exchange.

The Bank continued to help diversify financial services in its DMCs. It

Law and Development

As part of the Bank’s efforts to strengthen legal frameworks for
development in its DMCs, a lechnical assistance grant was approved
during the year to strengthen PRC’s legal framework for custorns
administration. Assistance was also provided for urgent reforms to the
insolvency law applicable to state-owned! enterprises. Under another
advisory Lechnical assistance project, the Bank assembled a tzam of legal
advisers Lo assist Morigolia in developing a legal framework and
formulating jegal Lrainina programs.

Co-financing and Guarantee Operations

Co-financing arranged in support of Bank-assisted operations in
4994 amounted to $1,629 million for 18 projects. This compared with
23 projects co-financed in 1993 amounting to $3,324 million, The
decline in 1994 was partly due to steps taken by the Bank to rationalize
project processing schedules, which postponed some projects involving cofinancing. Also, the Bank's 1994 portfolio did not contain infrastructure
projects requiring large araounts of export! credit,

In 1994, external finance mobilized through various co-financing
modalities amounted to 44% of the total Bank lending for all projects and
programs, The volume was almost equal to the Rank's own lending of
$1,641 million for the projects and programs co-financed.

During 1994, co-financing operations continued to focus on infra
structure, with the energy sector receiving the biggest share of co-financing
(4.294). It was lollowed by transport and communications (40%), social
infrastructure (16%), and industry and non-fuel minerals (2%). The largesl
official co-financing project arranged during the year 1994 was
Bangladesh's mullipurpose Jamuna Bridge Project, which attracted a
total of $600 mitlion. For details, see fable 15 in the Statistical
Annex,

Official sources of co-[inancing, other than export credits, contributed $1,234 million or 75% ol the Lotal in 1994, Of this, about $706
million was provided by bilateral agencies and $528 million by multilateral institutions. ‘

Co-financing from commercial sources amounted to $301 million
for six projects, Of these, three were arranged in the syndicated loan
market under the Bank's Complementary Financing Scheme, two were
parallel term loans, and one was a grant from a privale group providing
advisory service. ‘

Co-financing from export credit agencies amounted to $94
rnillion,

As of end-1994, 403 Bankc-assisted loan projects and programs had
received co-financing for a cumulative total of $18.8 billion,

The Theun-Hinboun i lydropower Project in Lao PDR, approved in
1994, provided an example of the Bank's approach to co-financing. The
project is the first major (210 MW) hydropower plant to be built in the
country by a joinl venture between the Government and private sector
companies. The Bank allowed the Government to use the $60 million
Bank Joan to finance ils portion of equity in the joint venture company.
This enabled the Government to take a majority share in the company.
The Bank also brought logelher a aroup of private partners wilh different

pean eScomparative strengths and took the lead role in drawing up an optional
financing plan. A total co-financing of $166 million will be mobilized from
international commercial banks, export credit agericies, and bilateral and
multilateral aid agencies. Private partners will contribute $44 million by
way of equity.

Bank’s Kole in Resource Transfer

‘The net transfer of resowces {defined as disbursements less principal
repayments and prepayments, payments of interest and other charges
plus net equity investnents) from the Bark lo the DMCs increaserl from
$931 million in 1993 to $1,100 million in 1994. This represented an
increase of 18%, compared with a decrease of 21% in the previous year.

Of the total net transfer, $124 million was from OCR and $976 million
from ADF. The net transfer from OCR continued to fall, showing a 29%
decrease from 1993, mainly due to a negative flow to Indonesia. Oni the
other hand, there was a 29% Increase In the net transfer from ADF
because of higher disbursements to Bangladesh and Pakistan,

Several factors contributed to the 1994 increase: (i) there were more
loans under implementation, although fewer new loans were approved; (ii)
the Bank ancl its borrowers redoubled their efforts to improve project
quality; and (ii) project administration procedures were further streamlined in coordination with the Bank's regional and resident offices.

Loan disbursements reached an all-time high of $3,688 million in
1994, up 25% from 1998. This was the resull of betler project implementation in Bangladesh, Inelia, Inclonesia and Pakistan, and a substantial
increase in disbursernents to PRC. However, several DMCs, including
Malaysia, Philippines and Sri Lanka, continued io experience decreases in
dishursements. For details of disbursements, see page Li5 and
Table 21 in the Statistical Annex.

The disbursement ratio, including program loans and defined as the
ratio of disbursements curing the year aver the undishursed net loan
balance at the beginning of the year, remained unchanged at 18%.

By volume of net flow, Bangladesh, PRC, India and Pakistan were
the top four recipients of net transfers from the Bars. Although lean
disbursements to Indonesia increased, it made a prepayment of $347.5
million in 1994, As a result, Indonesia experienced tor the first time a
negative net transfer amounting to $413 million. Others who experienced negative transters were Fiji. Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Myanmar
and Philippines.

For details of net transfers, see tulles 35-37 in the Statistical
Annex.

substantial increase in the Bank’s authorized and subscribed capital stack
was urgently required, and accorelingly recommended to the Board of
Governors a capital increase of 100%. On 22 May 1994, the Board of
Governors adopted Resolution No. 232 authorizing a fourth General
Capital Increase (GCI IV) as recommended by the Board of Directors.

wilh the remaining 98% in the farm of callable shares. Of the payments
for paid-in shares, 40% should be i converlible currency and 60% in the
naltonal currency of tie subscribing member. The final date for subscribing to GCHIV is 31 December 1995 or such later date as the Board of
Directors may determine.

Review of Income Outlook

In April 1994, the Board undertook a review olf (i) the Bank's net
income in recent years, (ii) the outlook for the coming years, taking into
account the interest rate ancl loan porifolio risks, and (ii) the adequacy of
the Bank's loan charges, particularly its lencling spread. Projections in the
review indicated that over the next five years, the Ranks critical income
ratios would remain significantly above the minimum requirements.
Because of the gradual decline in the proportion of cost-free funds to the
total earning assets and Jow interest rates prevailing, the Bank’s
reserve:loan ratio (RLR) was projected to exhibit a gracduat decline over
the next five years. In this context, it was suggested that in the near future
the Bank start considering alternative ways of immunizing the RLR from
exchange rate fluctuations. for example, by aligning the currencies of its
reserves with those of its loans. Furthermore, on the basis of the review,
the Board concluded that the lending spread for vaviable-rate loans should
be mainlained al the existing level of 40 basis points.

The Board also decided to recomunend to the Board of Governors
thal $70 million of the 1993 OCR net income be allocated to the Technical

The Board approved the establishment of a new market-based loan
window that will provide funds at current terms prevailing in international
capital markets, The new window, which is in keeping with the Bank's
continuing efforts to provide products that clients in DMCs need, is the
Bank's thivel leading window, The other two are the pootbased
multicurrency loan window and the pool-based single-currency loan
window jn US dollars. The lending rate on each of these two windows is
based on the historic cost of a pool of borrowings undertaken separately
for each facility. In contrast, the lending rate on each market-basecl loan
will be basecl on the Bank's current cost of borrowings used to support
such a loan,

‘The purpose behind the new window is threefold, First, there is a
growing demand for market-related lending instruments from financial
intermediaries which relend Bari funds to sub-borrowers that prefer to
borrow at current terms in international markets, ¢.a., lhe London Inter
Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Second, pricing for the Bank’s private sector
loans will become more ansparent as interest rales on such loans will be
based on explicit current cosls of Bank borrowings. Third, the financial
operations of private sector lending on market-related ierms will be
rationalized through the matching of assets ancl liabilities to reduce the
volatility of the Bank's income. The new window will primarily benefit the
private sector which is the main engine of growth in the DMCs, [ts intvocluction broadens the product line offered by the Bank and, consequently,
strengthens the Bank's developmental role.

Access to the window is limited to financial intermediaries in the
public sector and to all borrowers in the private sector. Access by financial
intermediaries will be limited to $1 billion for the first two years af the
window's operations. Because the scope of market-based lending
operations is limited and because of the eligible borrowers’ currency
preferences, the currencies offered under the new window are the

Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and the US dollar. Since the availabilily of
swaps beyond ten years is limited and since the disbwrsernent profile of
market-based loans is expected to be around five years, the Bank is able
lo offer borrowers maturities of up lo 15 years. Maturities will normally
be eiyht to 15 years. Longer rnalurilies will depend on suitable funding.

The lending rale for inarkel-based loans is determined by ackling a
lending spread over a base rate, the six-month LIBOR. While the spread
will be determined at the lime of approval and fixed throughout the life of
a loan, the base rate wil) vary over time and will reflect the Barik's current
cast of borrowing. Borrowers may choose either floating-rate or fixedrate loans, Fer floating-rate loans, the interest rate, computed on 15
March and 15 September, or 15 June and 15 December, is equivalent to
the six-month LIBOR plus the Jending spread, For fixed-rate loans, the
interest rate, which will be set at each disbursement, is equivalent to the
swap rate of the six-month LIBOR plus the lending spread. A borrower is
given a one-time option te convert its floating-rate loan into a fixed-rate
loan or vice versa, subject to a one-time fee of 0.125% and the availability of swap opportunities. The new lixed lending rate is equal to the swap
rate of the sixanonth LIBOR plus the original lending spread and
0.125% for swap exposure. The naw floating interest rate is equal to the
six-month LIBOR plus the original lending spread and 0.125% far swap
exposure. Offering financial intermediaries a choice of loan terms will
allow them to make the tertns and condlilions of their relending activities
mare flexible to meet the diverse needs of their sub-borrowers.

With the introduction of the market-based loan window, private
sector borrowers and public sector financial intermediaries borrowing from
the Bank will have four loan alternatives: (i) pool-based multicurrency, (ii)
pool-based single-currency in US dollars, (iti) fixed-rate Japanese yen or
Swiss francs or US dollars, and (iv) floating-rate Japanese yen or Swiss
franes or US dollars.

The current commmitment fee of 0.75% per annum on poel-based
loans also applies to loans to financial intermediaries under the markelbased lending facility. Such loans do nol carry any front-end lee. For
private sector loans, there is a front-end fee of 1% of the loan amount and
a commitment fee of 0.5% per annwun levied on the increasing portions of
the loary.

Market-based loans are priced individually in contrast to the poolbased Jencing system where a uniform interest rate and lending spread
are applied to all loans covered by the pool. As a result, interest rate risk
management for the new window will be more complex than for the
existing pool-based windows, With a view to controlling the basic sources
of interest rate risk, the Bank has adoptecl a matched funding policy
through which loans and borrowings will have broaclly similar terms.

The operation of the market-based loan window will be reviewed
after two years,

Currency Composition of Loans

 

In 1994, the major currencies of loan dishursement were yen
(61.13%), Swiss frane (3.72%). and US collar (35.15%). The concentration in yen and Swiss francs was in line with the Bank's practice of
borrowing and disbursing in low-coupon currencies under the
mutticurrency loan facility to keep the lending rate low. Disbursements in
US dollars were principally for loans under the US dollar lendlirig facility.

Disbursements of OCR loans ih 1994 reached a record level anc
totalled $2,501 million, an increase of 24.1% aver 1993. Principal
vepayments for the year were $1,221 tnillion, of which $392 million

Borrowings

The major objectives of the Bank’s borrowing and liability managemerit strategy are fo ensure the availability of long-term funds for lending
operations. fund the liquidity porlfolio and minimize the cos! of borrowing
for the Bank and iis borrowing member countries. To achieve these
objectives, the Bank seeks to:

(i} maintain a borrowing presence in the major capital markets and,
where possible, increase the size of its public bond issues to improve the
liquidity of its bonds in secondary markets, broacleri the distribution of its
bonds, and align its funding ancl trading spreads with those of other
supranational borrowers:

(ii) emphasize borrowings in the longer maturity range to minimize
fluctuations in its lencling rates and lo ensure a reasonable maturity
relationship between borrowings and loans;

Gil), expanel its investor base by borrowing in the private placement
markets of various currencies;

(iv) tap new markets, especially where this would contribute to the
development of capital markets in the Asian and Pacific region,

(v) ° utilize swap markets where cost-ellicient arbitrage can significantly lower the cost of targel currencies and transform slruclured
financing inte ‘plain vanilla’ fixed-rate liabililies; aid

(vi) use short-term bridge financing should Lemporary deficiencies in
dishursement or debt-service currencies arise and if market conditions are
not attractive for bond issues with longer maturities.

During 1994, the Bank raised funds totalling $1,335 million {see
table}. After a total notional amount of $645.8 million in interest rate
swaps, the year's borrowings, except for $250 million of the inaugural US
dallar global bonds, were fixed-rate liabilities denominated In US dollars
and Japanese yen. The average maturity of the borrowings undertaken in
1994 was 10.4 years compared to 10.5 years in 1993, and the after-swap
cost of the fixecl-rate liabilities was 5.47%, compared to 6.16% in 1993,
The average cost of funds raised duing 1994 was 4.33% per annum lor
the multicurrency variable lending rate facility (i.¢., all borrowings except
the US dollar global bonds) and 6.81% per annum for the US dollar
variable-rate lendirig faciliiy

The Barik’s first US dollar global bord issue was underlaken in
February with a principal amount of $750 million and a ten-year maturity. A $250 million portion of this issue was swappect into a US collar
floating-rate liability and used for the newly approved market-based loan
window.

With a view to diversifying ils sources of funding, the Bank entered
into three structured Japanese yen private placements, each with a
principal arnount of ¥10 billion. These borrowings were swapped into

Apart from the 1994 horrawings, a number of Euro-commercial
paper transactions, totalling approximately $448 rnillion, were undertaken by the Bank to counteract temporary deficiencies in disbursement
anc debt-service currencies.

As of 31 December 1994, the Bank's outstanding borrowings
amounted to $13,716.6 million, with an average maturity of 6.82 years
and an average after-swap cost of 6.1%.

Liquid Asset Investments

As of 31 December 1994, the Bank’s liquid assets totalled
$5,552 million, or approximately 44.2% of uncisbursed loan balances.
The Bank's liquid assets consist of investment holdings (net of special
reserve investmerits) ard unrestricted cash. Year-end levels of liquid assets
aré maintained al no less than 40% of undisbursed balances of both
effective and not-ye(-elfective loans, This helps to ensure the uninterrupied availability of funds for the Bank’s operations and adds to the
Bank's flexibility in its borrowing activities, especiaily when berrowings
may be temporarily affected by adverse conditions in the capital markets.

Investment of the Bank's liquid assets is governed by the primary
objective of ensuring the security and fiquiclity of funds invested. Subject
to this objective, the Bank seeks to rraximize the income on funds22S AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

invested. It actively manages its liquid asset portfolio within the credit and
market risk pararrielers outlined under the Investment Authority approved
by the Board in October 1991. Under this Authority, the Bank is permitted, among other things, to invest in the obligations of government and
government-quaranteed| entities, to engage in securities lencling and
borrowing, to enter into ‘short’ securities positions, to execute transactions in exchange-traded financial futures and options, and to engage in
covered forward investments. The Bank may not assume foreign exchange risk in its investment portfolio,

As a result of the poor climate for fixed-income securities in 1994,
the Bank assumed a generally defensive posture with regard to market
risk exposure on its portfolio, This was evidenced by a subslantial
increase in short-dated time deposits and other bank instruments held in
the portfolio, Of the tolal OCR inveslment portfolio, 68% was held in bank
instruments while 32% was held in securities issued or guaranteed by
member governments (compared with 21% and 79%, respectively, in
1993). Furthermore, during 1994, the Bank began using exchange-traded
financial futures contracts in rnanaging market risk exposure.

’ As of 31 December 1994, the Bank's OCR investments totalled
$5,645 million equivalent, compared to $5,641 million equivalent as of
31 December 1993. The investinent portfolio was denominated in 23
different currencies. The realized rate of return on OCR investments in
1994 was 4.9% compared with 7% in 1993. The decline in the realizect |
rate of return was attributed to adverse .
market conditions prevailing in international fixed-income markets during the
year,

ADF and TASF Replenishment (ADF VI)

I HE CURRENT Asian Development Fund (ADF) and Technical
Assistance Special Fund (TASF) replenishment (ADF VJ, authorized by
Resolution No, 214 of the Board of Governors in February 1992, is
intended to finance the Bank's concessiorial lending operations during the
four years from 1992 to 1995. The replenishment total, based on the
exchange rates specified in the resolution (the average of daily exchange
rates curing the first quarter of 1994) is $4.2 billion, Of this amount.
$140 million is for allocation to the TASE, primarily for project-related
technical assistance to poorer DMCs are for regional technical assistance.

Dwing 1994, ADF VI listruments of Contribution were received
from Turkey and United Stales, bringing the Lotal arnount of instruments
received Ly the ene! of the year to $4,028 million (at lhe exchange rates
specified in the resohition), Only Lhe Instrument of Contribution of Italy
remained outstanding. The Instruments of Contribution of Canada and
United States contain a qualification, as permilted by the resolution, that
all payments for their contributions except the first would be subject to
budgetary appropriations

The resolution envisaged that contributions would become available
to the Bank for operational commitments in four equal tranches during
the years 1992 to 1995. In early 1994, the United States made available
$75,022,950, or 44.13%, of its first tranche. and in November it made
available a further $167,960,000, representing the balance of
$94,977,050, or 55.87%, of its first tranche and $72,982,950, or
42.93%, of its seconcl tranche. The resolution envisaged that the second,
third arnt fourth tranches of the unqualified contributions would become
available for operational cornmitments as from 1 January 1993,

1 January 1994 and 1 January 1995, respectively. However, curing
1994, with the Uniled States unable lo release ils contribution on the
schedule envisaged in the resolution, several other donors exercised their
right, pending the availability of a further amount of the United States’
contribution, to recuuce the amount of their second and/or third tranches
which would be available to the Bank for operational commitments
Donors which exercised this right were Austria, Belgium, Canada,

ADF Commitment Authority

At the beginning of 1994, total ADF commitment authority, ie., the
maximum amount of ADF lencling which the Bank could undertake with
the available resources, was about $720 million. Amounts which became
available during the year from donor contributions added about $1,870
million to the resources (at the exchange rates applicable at the time of
release). During the year, the US dollar value of resources contributed by
nearly all donors increased significantly as a result of currency appreclations against the US dollar,

Under the financial policies approved by the Board in January 1991,
the ADF lending lirnitation is defined as @ certain proportion, referred to as
the gearing ratio, of undisbursed resources. At the end of 1994, the ADF
lending limiiation was about $7,877 million. The ADF lending headroom
(equal to the difference belween Lhe lending limnitalion and the arnount of
committed but undisbursed loans) amounted lo $1,887 million. ba
addition, the Bank had advance commilment authority of $212 million
(equivalent to 85% of projected ADF investment income and loan repayments during the period 1 January 1995 to 31 Decemher 1995). The
Bank's tetal ADF comrnitment authority at the end of 1994 therefore stood
at $2,099 million.

ADF Loan Disbursements and Repayments

The total ADP disbursements during 1994 Increased by 28.2% to
$1,186 million from $925 million in 1993. At the end of the year,
cumulative disbursements from ADI resources reached $9,602 million.
Loan repayments for the year amounted to $105 million and cumulative
repayments came to $641 million. During 1994, three ADF loans were
fully repaid and 26 new ADE loans were approved by the Board.

ADF Revenue and Expenses

In 1994, the excess of ADF revenue over expenses (net income}
was $61 million, bringing the accurnulited surplus to $870 million at the
end of the year.

Gross revenue, consisting mainly of revenue from ADF investments
and service fees on ADF loans, amounted to $137 million. Expenses,
consisting mainly of administration charge pavable to ordinary capital
resources, were $76 million

Portfolio Position

The ADF investment portfolic amounted to $614 million at the end
of 1994, compared with $725 million at the end of 1993. Of the
portfolio, 25% was held in securities issued or guaranteed by governments of member countries. The rest was invested in deposits and other

bank instruments in member countries, The return on ADI investments
was 4.4%, compared with 5.5% in 1993.

Cumulative ADF loans grew by 12.8% to $17,346 million. The
loans were concentrated in Pakistan (29.1%), Bangladesh (27.69%), Sri
Lanka (10.3%), Nepal (6.4%) and Philippines (6.3%).

The portfolio was denominated in 18 currencies. Japanese yen and
US dollars formed 72% of the portfolio.

Loans to Afghanistan have been in nonacerual status since the
beginning of 1993. The country's loans outstanding amounted to
$34 million, about 0.3% of total outstanding ADF loans.

Technical Assistance Special Fund

The TASF portion of ADF VI contributions received by the Bank as of
31 December 1994 amounted to $144.7 million (equivalent to $134.6
million at the exchange rates specified in Governors’ Resolution No. 214),
In May 1994, the Board of Governors allocated $70 million from the
1993 net incame of OCR to TASF, During the year, Pakistan
made a direct. voluntary contribution te TASF amounting to $62,000

As of end-1994, total TASF resources amounted to $532.2 million,
composed! of allocations from ADF V and ADF VI contributions
($235.5 million), allocations from OCR net income ($180 million}, direct
volintary contributions to TASF ($85.6 million), income from
investments and other sources ($32.4 million) and transfers out of
‘TASE to ADF ($1.3 million), Out ol the total TASF resources,
$330.8 million had been utilized, leaving an unntilized balance of
$201.4 million.

Operations and Resource Position

The TASF contributed 51% of funcling for services to member
countries, with 138 new projects approved during the year, Revenue
from investments increased from $1 million in 1993 to $2.2 million,
in spite of a decline in the yielel on TAST investments from 3.8% in
1993 to 2.6%. The revenue increase. was due mainly to additional
resources available frorn the allocation from OCR income and
the second regularized TASF replenishment, Tota! revernie and comtributions amourited to $97 million. Against the TASF undisbursed balance of
$201 million, there were outstanding comrnitiuerits of $95 million,

‘The $48 million cash contribution received in 1994 more than fully
funded the $40 million TASF experiditure. The balance was used to
increase the investment portolio.

At the end of the year, TASF investments stood at $98 million. Other
assels, comprising dues [rom banks, accounts receivable from ADF and
contributors, advances to consultants and others, totalled $127 million.
Accounts payahle to consultants and others amounted to $24 million.

dapan Special Fund

During 1994, the Government of Japan provided a total amount of
¥9,87 billion (equivalent to about $100.1 million) for its seventh-year
contribution to the Japan Special Fund (JSF). The amount included ¥7.6
billion in regular contributions and ¥2.27 hillian in supplementary
contributions. This brought Japan's cumulative commitments to JSF since
its inception on LO March 1988 to Y53.13 billion (equivalent to about
$512.5 million, including translation adjustments).

The cumulative tolal included regular contributions arnounting to
¥45.6 billion (equivalent to approximately $436.3 million) and supplementary contributions of ¥7.63 billion {about $76.2 million). The supplementary contributions were to be used for organizing symposia/baining
(¥0.23 billion), worerrin-development activities (¥1 billion), enviranment-related activities (¥4.7 billion), ancl activities to promote the private
sector {(¥1.7 billion).

Of the total contributions received, $151.8 million had been utilized
as of 31 December 1994, including $149.7 million for teclinical assistance and $2.1 million for equity inveslrnents. Furnls awaiting disbursement are invested. In 1994, income from such investments amounted to
$7.2 million. As agreed with the Japanese Government, part of the
investment income was used to defray the Bank's cirecl and identified
administrative expenses.

 

Operations and Resource Position

Total expenditure amounted to $4.1 million (up 20%) for servic
member countries. $0.97 million (up 54%) in administrative expenses and
$1.2 million in provision for losses. The revenue from investments of JSF
resources amourited to $7.2 million, a decrease of 6.9%, The realized rate
of return on investment declined from 3.1% in 1993 ta 2.2%.

in the private sector. Of the public sector projects, 337 were performing
satisfactorily (by conforming to target dates and project costs, and
complying with loan covenants established during appraisal}, 46 faced
implementation or operational problems and one was considered inactive.

During the year, 422 project administration missions, including
private sector oan rnissions and multiproject missions, were fielded to
review the progress of projects and to discuss remedial measures with
executing agencies. These missions spent a total of 5,135 persondays, or
an average of 8.26 persondays per project, The average wes higher than
last year's 7.5 persondays per project as the Bank paid greater attention
to project quality. [n addition, imple:nentation support was provided to
executing agencies by the Bank's regiomal arid resident offices, Portfolio
performance reviews were carried out to improve disbursements by
restructuring or reformulating slow-moving projecls and identifying loan
proceeds for cancellation.

Country project review missions were undertaken in nine DMCs. The
purpose was to discuss implementation prablems, cross-sectoral issues
and necessary remedial measures with senior government officials,

‘Lhe implementation of 88 projects was completed, bringing to 903
the cumulative number of completed projects. Project completion reports
were prepared for 55 projects. The total number of reports prepared as
of end-1994 was 628. For details, see Table 20 in the Statistical
Annex,

Projecl adininistration procedures continued to be revised in the light
of the Bank’s Strategic Plan. Computer systerns continued to be developed for betler ronitoring and evaluation of benefits. ‘The curricula of
project implementation seruinars for executing agencies were restructured and a training program was established at the request of borrowers.
Technical assistance was provided lo acquamit government personnel with
the Bank's operational requirements, policies and procedures, particularly those related to procurement and dishursement.

In addition, nine seminars and workshops were held to enhance the
implementation capabilities of executing agencies (see table). A total of
284 senior and middle-level officials benefited from this activity. Besides,
48 in-house seminars were held for Bank staff dealing with project
processing and administration.

Contract Awards

During 1994, contracts totalling $3,731 million were awarded by
execuling agencies in DMCs for consulting services, procurement of
goods and relaled services, and civil works, ‘This represented a 6%
increase from 1993. Consultaricy contracts under loan projects, although
a small proportion of total contract awards, play a vital role in transferring
skills and technologies to promote the development of domestic consultants. During 1994, consultancy contracts under loart projects totalled
$233 million. These involved 176 consulling firms {84 international and
92 domestic) and 36 individual consultants (26 international and ten
domestic),

For technical assistance projects, the Bank awarded 395 contracts
for consultancy services amounting to $94.2 million and involving 298
consulting firms and 279 individual consultants.

Seminars on business opportunities were held in Austria, Canada,
France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New
Zealand, Philippines, Spain, Switzerland, Taipei,China, Thailand and
United Kingdom.

For deiails, see Tables 19-29 in the Statistical Annex.

Loan Disbursements

Loan disbursements for the year ending 1994 reached a record high
of $3,685 million. This amounl exceeded the last highest level of loan
disbursements achieved in 1991 of $3,104 million by 19% and exceeded
the previous year’s loan disbursements by 25%, Of this, OCR disbursements amounted to $2,501 million and ADF disbursements $1,187
million, up 24% and 28%, respectively, as compared to 1993 (up 21%
and 14%, respectively, as compared to 1991), The total loan disbursements exceeded the 1994 target of $3,230 million by 14%.

The comparative details of disbursements in 1993 and 1994 by
lending modality are shown on fhe accompanying table.

Countries with significant disbursements during the year and which
did well in implementing Bank-financed projects included Bangladesh,
People’s Republic of China, india, Indonesia and Pakistan,

The increase in disbursements tn 1994. partly reflected the continu
ing efforts by the Bank and its borrowers towards improving project qualily
with increased accountability in project implementation aspects.

Private Sector Invesiment Porifolio

The private sector portfolio stood at $505 million as of end-1994,

Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation

Benelit monitoring and evaluation refers td a group of activities that
seek to improve lhe beneficial impact of loans, as well as to incorporate
lessons of experience into current and future lending operations. In
1994, one seminar was conducted (or Bank staff and one workshop was
held for executing agencies to enhance awareness and understanding in
this respect

Many loan and technical assistance projects provided support to
strengthen the capabilities of agencies to monitor and evaluate. Among
these were the Socio-Environmental Assessment of the Meghna
Dhonagoda Irrigation Project in Bangladesh and Health Managernent
information System and Health Planning in Marshall Islands. Technical
assistance was provided to help develop capabilities to post-evaluate the
benefits of completed projects in Bangladesh and PRC.

Further to the recommendation of the Task Force on Improving
Project Quality, benefit monitoring and evaluation is being simplified and
integrated inte the Bank's operations by using the project framework as
the basis for designing activities.

Project Performance Audit Reports

The 24 project performance audit reports prepared during 1994covered one program loan and 24 projects {one report covered two
projects). Of these, nine projects and one program were In seven Group A
countries; 13 projects in three Group B countries; and twa projects in one
Group C country. Sectorwise, nine projects were In social infrastructure,
seven in agriculture ancl agro-industry, four in energy, and two each in
finance and iransport and conumunications. The program loan pertained
to the industry sector. A salient fealure of the 1994 program was that it
inclucled the first post-evaluation of projects in People’s Republic of China
{two projects) and India (one project).

Cumulatively, by the end of the year, 432 project performance audit
reports had been prepared for 452 projects and programs covering all
major sectors ane subsectors in 26 DMCs.

Of the 25 projects/program post-evaluated in 1994, 15 (60%) were

Post-evaluation Approach and
Project ‘Classification

T. HE'BANK’S post-evaluation system has two prinzipal objectives: (i) to nnprove the design and execution of future activilies in |
the light of past experience; and (ii) to accounl to the Bank’s shareholders for the effectiveness of Bank assistance to its DMCs, To
achieve these. objectives, the Bank undertakes intlependenit postevaluation of its projects/programs and technical assistance; carries out impact evaluation and special studies on topics of broader
relevance to the Bank’s future operations, practices and procecltires,
and feacls lessons learnt into the.operational system of the Bank, Tt
also assists the DMCs in developing and steengthening thet tr OWN
evaluation capabilities,”

Post-evaluation is geherally carriecl out’ about three years after a
project Is compleled to erisure availability of adequate data relating’
to project costs and benefits to facilitate a more objective assessmerit
of project performance and sustainability, Apart from reviewing the
project experience in terms of formulation, implementation and
operational performance, the exercise identifies issues or factors
relevant to performance arid the develdpment impact for fulure
Bank operations.

The general target of the Bank’s posl-evalualion exercise is thal,
at the end of each year, 50% of the cumulative total number of
projects corrpleted as of thal date should be covered.

On the basis of implementation experience, expected performance and development impact, projects are classified as generally
successful, parily successful or unsuccessful. A projectis considered
generally successhil if it is expected to be economically viable or can
generate sociogconomic benefits commensurate with original
expectations and/or casts incurred, A project is ratecl as partly
successiul if its benefits are believed to be sustainable at reduced
levels, with reasonable. prospects for improvement if remedial actions
are taken, If a project is not technically and/or economnically viable, it
is classified as unsuccessful. It is iniportarit to note that such classificaticin made at the time of-post-evaluation may be revised curing
subsequent re-evaluation. Also, a pairtly successful project is not to be
viewed 2 as an A unsuccessful project.

 

 

 

   

 

 

anc programs classified as of the end of 1994, 270 (60%) were generally
successful, 135 (30%) partly successful and 45 (10%) were unsuccessful,
The program loan and most of the projects post-evaluated in 1494
had been approved during the 1980s and completed in the early 1990s,
Arnong the problems that most of the projects encountered were failure
to establish project implementation units on time; difficulties in the
recruitment of consultants and in the procurement and delivery of
equipment; lack of counterpart funds: less than salislactory performance
of contractors: inexperience of executing agencies; and land accuisition
problems.

‘The total investment cost of the post-evaluated projects/program
hac originally been eslimated at $1,453 million. Actual costs upon
completion carne to $1,095 million, about 25% lower, Loans from the

 

 

 

!
1
'Bank arnournted to $996 million. Of this amount, $800 million, or 80%,
was actually disbursed, The unclerruns in project costs and Bank financing
were also due to factors such as reduction in project scope, movements of
exchange rates, lower than-eslitnaled costs of construction and equipment, and overestimalion of costs and contingencies during appraisal.

In terms of actual investment costs, lowever, 68% of the projects/
program posi-evaluated in 1994 were generally successful, 27% partly
successful and 5% unsuccessful, Qn the basis of loan amounts disbursed,
the respective rates were 73%, 22% and 4%. This inclicates that the
more successful of the post-evaluated projects generally involved bigger
investment casts and relatively large Bank loans,

The analysis of project performance by sector and country js limited
by the srnall number of projects post-evaluated. Nevertheless, five out of
the seven post-evaluated projects in the agriculture sector, or 71%, were
rated us generally successful. ‘his was the best performance record for
this sector in the past 15 years. These projects - in forestry, support
services and rural clevelopment subsectors ~ were well prepared and
unaffected by adverse exogenous circunisfances, Projects in the electric
power ancl ports sectors continued to fare well. OF the nine posl-evalualed
projects in the social infrastructure sector, only two iirban development
projects were rated as generally successful, All the water supply, education
andl health prajects post-evaluated In 1994 were classified as either partly
successful or unsuccesstul, The parthy successful or unsuccessful projects
suffered from design deficlencies and inadequate funds for sustained
operations after their carnpletion.

The 15 generally successful projects have contributed to the social
and economic clevelopments of the countries concerned {see box on
Economic and Social Benefits), Factors having a bearing on project
perlormance includecl appropriateness of project preparation and design,
irplemerilation arrangements, capability of executing agencies, coordinaHon among relevant agencies, operational sustainability and government
policies and corumilment. The 1994 exercise confirmed a number of
useful lessons. First, it is pragmialic lo keep the project design simple,
well-fociised, manageable in scope, and compatible with the DMCs’
absorptive capacity. Second, the Bank should monitor the progress of
implementation more systematically and carefully. Third, beneficiaries
should be involved in the design and implementation of projects to
encourage greater ownership.

 
 

 

 

Technical Assistance Performance
Audit Reports

The three technical assistance performance auclit reports prepared
during the year were about a human resource planning project in Lao
PDR. a study on the policy inypact of a Barik-financed agriculture program loan in Sri Lanka and a feasibility stucdly on a watershed conservation and management project. in Bhutan, All three were [ound to be
partly successful, While they were reasonably salisfactory in some
aspects, they suffered from design deficiencies and inadequate supervision. The exercise underscored the neer] in adopt a lagical framework
approach in the design of technical assistance projects to ensure a
coherence between the inputs provided and the expected outcome.

relating lo project quality.

The Managernent Committee on Post-Evaluation Findings helt its
biannual meetings in April and November to discuss issues emerging
frorn post-evalualion studies that warrant Management's attention and
guidance, The meelings reinforced the need to address more effectively
the issues of capacity building, treatinent of risk ancl uncertainty, benefit

In view of its independent funclion and role in the Bank, the Internat
Audit Office (AO) reports to Lhe President. It assists all levels of managemerit in the Bank by conducting independent and objective appraisal and

(AO's effort to promote operational and organizational efficiency
in all areas of Bank operations continued to be reflected in the auclits
conducted during 1994. These encompassed various audit subjects,
inclucing cost overruns on Bank-financed projects, and post:
implementation reviews of a nurnber of computerized systems arid

policies and procedures.

During the year, IAQ also completed its audit on atiditing and
reporting standards of borrowers’ auditors. The exercise formed part of a
series of project-related audits concluded over the past six years pertaining to the loan covenant on the submission of audited financial statements
from borrowers/executing agencies. These auclits have enhanced the
awareness within the Bank as well as its borrowers and execuling agencles of the importance of the financial reporting and auditing requirements of the Bank, and the need to look beyond financial accountability
to focus more on performance accountability,

In line with its overall objectives, [AO undertakes missions to the

. Bank’s DMCs to gain first-hand knowledge of problems and issues
identified in auclit reports compiled at Headquarters. The idea is to ensure
thal project-related audits and IAO’s aclvisory services to operational
departments include recommencations aimed at improving the Bank’s
policies, systems and procedures, and thus contribute to enhancing project
quality. In 1994, [AO undertook an iridependent mission to the
Philippines.

As part of its advisory services to other departrnents and offices, [AO
actively participated in a number of task forces and working groups,
inelucling those on (i) improving project quality; (ii) restructuring of the
Operations Manual; (iii) review of the Bank's accounting systems; and
{iv} rationalizing loari financial statislics.

In addition, IAO actively participaled in the Bankwide effort to
enhance productivity and performance through several new initiatives
which commenced in 1994, The initiatives include-{i) a review of the
Bank’s new [inancial instruments, including derivatives: (ii) further
promotion of operational auclits, focusing on economy, efficiency and
effectiveness, {iii} upclating of the Audit Manual to Incorporate the latest
audit techniques, (iv) expansion of ils direct and integrated assistance to
the Bank's external auditors; {v) development of an audit information
management system to automate the atxlitor’s work; and (vi) evaluation
and documentation of the Bank's systems of internal control,

[AO continued to be actively involved in the annual auclits of selected
constiltant contracts for lechnical assistance projects. Its direct and integrated assistance to the Bank's external auditors has been expanded to
cover selected transactions on borrowing, in addition to inveslment,
administrative expenses and loan disbursements. The Bank’s external
auditors evaluated IAO’s work to be of very high quality.

[AO monitors the status of woplementation of audit recommendations contairied in audil reports and conveys the results periodically to
Managernent and the Audit Committee of the Roard, as well as to heads
of departmenis and offices for necessary action. The length of the
implementation peried of a particular recommendation depends on its
nature and complexity. The satisfactory level of implementation of audit
recommendations during 1994 was reflective of the responsiveness of the
various departments and offices. At the same time, it indicated the
appropriateness of [AO's recommendations.

HE BOARD ol Directors, acling on the recommendation of
President Mitsuo Sato, appointed Peter H. Sullivan as Vice-President
(Operations) effective 6 July. Mr. Sullivan succeeded
Williarn R. Thomson, who resigned| from his position at the end of June.

Mr, Sullivan, who joined the Bank in 1975, has 22 years of legal and
development bank experience. Prior to his appointrnent as VicePresident, he was the Bank's General Counsel.

Personnel Management and Development

At the end of 1994, the Bank had a stall of 1,926 corning from 42 of
its 55 member countries. The total comprised 645! professional and 1,281
supporting staff, During the year, there were 62 appoinlments and 51
terminations of professional staff, while 78 supporting stall joiued Lhe Bank
and 50 left.

A systematic bankwide assessment of staff skills was undertaken
during the year. An inventory of available and desirable professional stalf
skills was completed. In the context of the Bank's reorganization effective
1 January 1995, detailed work was initiated to develop department-hydepartrnent human resource plans. The revised paper on the Bank's
Human Resource Development Operational Strategy for the medium term
was ¢liscussed in an informal meeting of the Board in August. The Board
approved a Special Separation Program which provided for the voluntary
separation al slaff so as to enhance staffing flexibility, utilize hurnan
resources more effectively and provide better career opportunities for staff
who remain on board.

Following a comprehensive study of ttre Bank’s staff performance
appraisal process, a substantially modified performance evaluation review
system was introducer! in April. The new sysiem places considerable
responsibility on the line division managers and departnent and office
heads for the effective implernentation af the performance appraisal
process.

In the area of staff training and skills development, the main thrust
duving the year was on strengthening the analysis of training needs,
consolidaling activities and further improving the quality and delivery of
in-house training programs, Greater attention was paid to strengthening
staff skills in addressing cross-cutting issues, such as protection of the
envirenment, reduction of poverty and development of the status of
women. The third round of the Manager Development Program was

The Bank was actively involved in pursuing a position paper prepared under the Spouse Erapleyment Initiative of the United Nations
Development Programme. The paper seeks the Philippine Government's
waiver of employment permit requirements for expatrlate spouses of the
staff of internalional agencies,

Compensation and Benefits

Effective 1 June 1994, the Board approved overall pay increases of
3.2% for professional staff and 9.7% for supporting staff. The increases
were distributed to staff according tn performance and their relative
positions in their respective salary ranges. The dependency allowance for
supporting staff was increased. Authority was given to the President to
adjust the allowance in accordance with changes in the dependency
allowance of the general staff in the Werkl Health Organization olfice in
Manila. The office serves as the Bank’s comparator institution in this
case,

Recognizing the-different costs of education in different countries,
new, country-specific overseas education grant limits were adopted, In
view ol the recent steep escalation of house rents in Manila, new staff
were given addilioral financial support in respect of their house rent
subsidies. Home leave allowances were realigned to better reflect current
costs. A provision for emergency leave was introduced in the case of
death of close relalives of stall. The previous compassionate salary
advance scheme. was replaced by a more flexible and quick-clisbursing
multipurpase loan facility. The terms of the salary advance facility for new
expatriate staff were improved.

An intevnal reorganization of the Bank was approved by the Board of
Directors in November to give its operations a sharper country focus and
use Bank resources more efficiently. The reorganization, effective
1 January 1995, is based on broad geographic specialization at the
regional vice presidency level, functional specialization (programs and
projects) at the department level and technical specialization at the
division level. The regional Vice-Presidents will be in charge of all operating functions [or countries under them, The central policy offices,
including the Strategy and Policy Office and the Office of Environment and
Social Development, will reporl directly to the President, while the operating support offices will continue lo be under the operational
Vice-Presidents, The functions of Vice-President (Finance and Administration) semain unchanged, (For the new organization chart, see

Confidentiality and Disclosure of
information

In September, the Board of Directors approved a new policy which,
while recognizing practical atid legal constraints, (i) provides for the
greatest degree of transparency and disclosure in all areas and aspects of
Bank activities and operations, and (ii) establishes procedures for its
implementation, including a revised classification system concerning
release of documents relaling to the public and private sector operations
of the Bank. The policy is effective from 1 January 1995,

information, (ii) ensure local participation in decisior-making and owrership of decisions, (ii) broaden understanding of the Bank’s role and
support for its mission, and (iv) facilitate cooperation and coordination
with others having common goals.

Information Policy and Strategy

In October, the Board approved an Information Policy and Strategy to
deliver the Bank's messages more effectively in member countries. The
policy codifies the Bank’s information requirements and objectives, while
the strategy identifies the key messages the Bank should deliver, its target
audiences and the most cost effective modes of delivery.

Information Technology Program

The computing capabilities of the Bank were enhanced with the
implementation of Network, Windows and Client-server-hased platforms
during 1994. These enhancements are based on the Information Terhnology Strategy adopted in 1992 to capitalize on the use ef new technologies for more efficient data processing.

‘To ensure network access for most users, 799 microcomputers and
notebooks were replaced or upgraded. The majority of the network
infrastructure was implernented with the acquisition and installation of
LAN servers, gateways, routers and concentrators. With the new platform
in place, a Bankwide electronic mail system, cc:Mail, was implemented
and an Internet link was established to promote access to internal and
external information resources.

Several energy conservation measures were introduced in the Barik’s
Headquariers building following Board approval of an energy conservation project in April. The project is expected to achieve significant energy
efficiency and could provide pointers for similar efforts in the Bank’s
DMCs. The development of an ADB Thesaurus and the automation of
the library proceeded as scheduled. A more user-friendly library, bringing
research materials clirectly to the offices of Bank staff through their PCs,
is expected to be in place by rnid-1995. The establishment of an archives
program also commenced, The Bank's printing facility underwent further
improvements through its acquisition of computerized map-making
capability.

 

Administrative Tribunal

In December, the Board approved several changes in the Statute of
the Administrative Tribunal, which had been established in April L991.
Uneler the changes, effective 1 January 1995, membership of the
tribunal will be expanded from three to five; cases will usually be heard by
a panel of lhree members, excepl in special circumstances; and dissenting
ninarily opinions will be attached to the main judgment.

Learning automotine Internal Administrative Expenses for 1994 amounted to
maintenance | $163,501 million against the original budget of $ 168.259 million. The
in Singapore | underutilization af $4.758 million was mainly due to lower expenses for
undera Bank foan | the Annual Maeting, lower-than-budgeted costs for staff consultants and
faimprove | business travel, slightly offset by the higher expenses for other administravocational anc ‘ ” “ i f Di =
industrial training: tive expenses and for the Board of Directors. oe _
The Internal Administrative Expenses for 1995 of $176.966 million
(summarized in Appendix 1), approved by the Board during the year,
represents an increase of $13,465 million over the actual expenses of
$163,501 million incurred in 1994, The increase is due to normal price
adjustments, provision for the inspection panel, increase in staff cousull
art requirements, increased business travel required to ieyalement the
recorrunendations of the Task Force on tmproving Project Qualily and the
usual provision for genéral contingency.

143ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK - ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 1994 and 31 December 1993

 

 

 

NOTE A ~ SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of members are functional currencies. The
reporling currency is the United States dollar, andl the
financial statements are expressed in thousancs of current
United Slates dollars.

Valuation of Capital Steck

The authorized capital stock of the Bank: is defined in
Article 4, paragraph 1 of the Articles of Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter) “in
terms of United Siates dollars of the weight and fineness in
effect on 3) danuary 1966” (the 1966 dollar) and the
value of each share is defined as 10,000 1966 dollars.
The capital stock had historically been translated into the
current United States dollar (the Bank's unit of account) on
the basis of its par value in terms of gold. From 1973 until
31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on this basis was
$1,20635 per 1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at which
time the Second Amendment tu the Articles of Agreement
of the Intemational Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect,
currencies no longer have par values in terms of gold.
Pending the Bank's selection of the appropriate successar
to the 1966 dollar, the capital stock has been valued for
purposes of these financial statements in terms of the
Special Drawing Right (SDR) at the value in current Unitecl

tates dollars as computed by the IMF, with each share
valued at SDR 10,000, ‘

 

As of 31 December 1994 the value of the SDR in terms of
the current United States dollar was $1.45985 ($1.37356
— 1993) giving a value for each share of the Bank's capital
equivalent to $14,598.50 ($13,738.60 - 1993). However, the Bank could decide to fix the value of each share
at $12,063.50 based on the 31 March 1978 par value of
the United States dollar in terms of gold.

Translation of Currencies

Assels and liabilities are translated from their functional
cunrericies to the reporting currency generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period.
Income and expense amounis are iranslated for each semimonthly period generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period; such practice

rt sna

 

 

approximates the application of average rates in effect
during the period, Transiation adjustments other than
those relating lo maintenance of value of currency holdings
(see Notes H andl L), are charged or credited to “Accum
fated translation adjustments", Exchange gains or losses
on currency transactions among functional currencies are
included in income.

Investments

The Bank adopted a new accounting standard for cerlain
investments in debt and equily securities as of 31 December 1993. All investment securities held by the Bank are
considered by management to be available for sale and are
‘reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses excluded from net income and reported in “CAPITAL AND RESERVES”. Estimated fair value generally
represents market value. Cost or amorlized cost Js used to
approxinate fair value for certain shorl-lerm investments
not traded in the market (time deposits, etc.), Realized
gains arxl losses are included in income from investments
and are measured by the difference between average cost
or amortized cost and the net proceeds of sales.

Short sales

Short sales are sales of securities not held in the Bank’s
portfolio at the time of the sale, The Bank must purchase
the security at a later date and bears the risk Lhal the
market value of the security will move adversely belween
the time of the sale and the time the security must be
delivered. The payable created upon entering into a shorl
sale is stated at the market value of the security subject to
the short sale and gains and losses resulting from changes
in market value are inchided in income frorn investments in
the period of the change.

  

Loaris

The Bank's loans are made to or guaranteed by members
or their governments, with the exception of loans to the
private sector, and have maturities ranging between 10 and
30 years. The Bank requires its borrowers to absurd exchange risks attributable to fluctuations in the value of the
curtencies which i! has disbursed. It is the policy of the
Bank to place in nonaccrual status all loans in which
principal, interest or other charges are overdue by six
months. Interest and other charges or: non-accruing loans
are included in income only to the extent that payments

have actually been received by the Bank. The Bank follows
a policy of not taking part in debt rescheduling agreements,

The Bank makes specific provisions for possible losses on
loans in which principal or interest is in arrears for one
year for loans made to or guaranteed by a member based
on consideration by the Board of Directors; and six months
for loans to the private sector based on an evaluation by
management of the collectibility of loans outstanding. On
the remainder ol the private sector porlfolio, the Bank
makes a general loan loss provision at a rate approved hy
the Board of Directors,

Equity Investments

Equity tnvestments are reported at the lower of cost or
estimated net realizable value on an individual investrment
basis. The Bank makes provisions for possible loss of value
quarterly based on management's evaluation of pdtential
losses in the equity investments porifolio,

Property, Furniture and Equipment

Property, [urnihire and equipment is stated at cost and,
except for land, is deprecialed over estirnaled useful lives
on the straight-line method, Maintenance, repairs and
minor betterments are charged to expense.

Investiients are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors. The main investmerit
managerneni objective Is to maintain security and liquidity,
Subject to these paramelers, the Bank seeks the highest
possible return on ils investments.

To reduce credit risk, the Bank is restricted by its Investment Authority to invest in (a) securities which are obligations of a limited universe of issuers, primarily qgovernment or government-guaranteed obligations, multilateral
banks and selected commercial banks; and (b} exchangetraced derivatives of such securities. Exposure to interest
rate isk may be adjusted within defined bancls to reflect
changing market circumstances. These adjustments are
made through the purchase and sale of both physical
securities and exchange-traded financial futures and
options, The Bank's use of options has been minirnal. To
increase returns, the Bank may invest in securities denominated in currencies other than the original functional

146

currencies and then enter into covered forward foreign
exchange agreements in order to maintain its original mix
of functional currency holelings. Accordingly, the financial
futures, options and covered forwards are held for risk
management rather than trading purposes.

Futures: Futures are contracts for delayed delivery of
securities or money market instruments in which the seller
agrees to make delivery at a specified future date of a
specified instrument at a specified price or yield. Initial
margin requirernerts are met with cash or securities, and
changes in the market prices are settled daily. Changes in
the market value of open futures contracts are recognized
as gains or losses in the period of the change and included
in income from invesiments. Outstanding futures contracts
at 31 December 1994 include purchase contracts with
notional value of $40,354,000-and sales contracts with
notional value of $49,783,000. All contracts are due in
1995.

Covered forwards: Covered forwards are agreements in
which cash in one currency is converted into a different
currency and simultaneously a forward exchange agreement is executed providing for a future exchange of the
iwo currencies in order to recover the currency converted.
The Bank records the covered-forward as an investment in
the underlying ‘currency, A receivable is created for the
forward contract of the originating currency and a payable
for the underlying instrument to be converted to the originating currency at maturity. Premiums or discounts are
deferred and amortized into Income from investrnents over
the life of the underlying iristrument. No covered forward
agreements were oulstanding at 81 December 1994,

NOTE D ~ LOANS

Loans outstanding Lo or guaranteed by members or their
governments with interest rates which vary based on the
pool-based variable lending rate system were fair valued
using an entry value method, Under this method, fair value
was determinec| based on the terms at which a sirailay foan
would currently be made by the Bank to a similar
borrower. For such loans, fair value approximated the
carrying amount. For undisbursed balances of effective
loans and for loans not yet effective, the contractual
amount approximated fair value.

Loans outstanding to or guaranteed by members or their
governments with fixed interest rates (principally loans

 

|
{
|
{made prior fo 1 July 1986) were fair valued using a
discounted cash flow method. This methed iakes into
account the scheduled cash flows over the average life, by
currenéy, of the loans, and current funding costs for the
average life including a factor for administrative costs. The
effect of possible prepayments was not considered material and was not included in the calculation.

The estimated fair value of loans to or guaranteed by
member's or their governments was not affected by credit
risks based on the Bank’s experience with its borrowers.

NOTE E - PROPERTY, FURNITURE AND
EQUIPMENT :

In 1991, under the terms of an agreement wilh the Republic of the Philippines (Governmen)), the Bank relumed the
former headquarters premises which had been provided by
the Government. In accordance with the agreement as
supplemented by a memorandum of understanding, ihe
Bank was compensated $22,657,000 for the return of
these premises. The compensation is in lieu of being
provided premises under ihe agreement and accordingly,
is deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the new
headquarters building as a tecuction of occupancy ex-’
pense. The amortization for the year ended 31 December
1994. amounted to $566,000 ($566,000 ~ 1993} reducing depreciation expense for the new headquarters building from $5,878,000 ($4,295,000 - 1993) to
$5,312,000 ($3,729,000 - 1993). At 31 December
1994, the unamortized deferred compensation balance
{included in “ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER
LIABILITIES -- Miscellaneous”) was $20,439,000
($21,005,000 - 1993).

. In 1994, the Bank reached a settlement with the main

building contractor of the Bank’s new headquarters bullding to resolve clairns far adclitional payments in cannection
with the construction of the building. The settlement was
made for an amount that did not have a material effect on
the financial statements of the Bank and has been capitalized in “Property, Furniture and Equipment”, as an addltion in 1994.

NOTE F - BORROWINGS AND SWAPS

The Bank uses derivative financial instruments in connection with its borrewing activities to facilitate access te

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS .

31 December 1994 and 31. December 1993

 

public and private debt markets and.to divérsify its funding
sources across markets, currencies and instrumerits, Cuurtency swaps are used to convert a currency borrowed
under advantageous terms into one of the Bank’s major
operational currencies, laking advantage of the opportunities offered in different financial markets. Such currency
swaps enable the Bank to raise operationally needed currencies in a cost-efficient way and maintain its borrowing
presence in the major capital markets. Interest rate swaps
are used generally to reduce balance sheet interest rate
mismatches arising from lending operations. :

The Bank issues structured debt which includes embedded
derivatives such as interest rate caps and floors in order to
improve an its cost efficiency of borrowing. However, the
Bank enters into simultaneous interest rate swaps to fully
hedge against the effects of such embedded derivatives.

The Bank has a potential risk of ‘loss if the swap
counterparty fails to perform its obligations (See Note R).
In order to reduce such credit risk, the Bank ory enters
into long-term swap transactions with counterparties eligible under the Bank's swap guidelines. The Bank cdloes not
anticipate thal any of its counterparties will fail to perform
their obligations under such agreements.

Interest rate swaps: Under a (ypical interest rate swap
agreement used by the Bank, one parly agrees lo make
periodic payments based on a nolional principal amount
and-an interest rate that is fixed al the oulsel of the
agreement. The counterparty agrees to make loaling rate
payments based on the same notional principal amount.
Amounts receivable or payable under the terms of ihe
swap are accrued over the period to which the payment
relates and the related cost or income is included in interest
and other financial expenses, The terms cf the Bank’s
interest rate swap agreements specifically match the terms
of particular borrowings.

Currency swaps: Under a typical currency swap agreement, ore party agrees to make perioclic payments in one
currency while the counterparty agrees to make periodic
payments in another currency, The payments may be fixed
at the outset of the agreement or vary based on interest
rates. A receivable is created for the periodic payments to
be received and a payable is created for the payments to be
made, Swap premiums and discounts are deferred and
amortized into interest and other financlal expenses over
the life of the underlying instruments. The terms of the

 

 

 

Bank's ciwrenéy swap agreements specifically match the
terms of particular borrowings. :

‘The fair value of borrowings outstanding is estimated using
prevailing market prices where available, or estimated
replacement values where market prices were not
available,

Outstanding currency and interest rate swap agreements
are fair valued al the estimaled amount that the Bank
would receive or pay to terminate the agreements based
upon market quotes from dealers.

NOTE H - MAINTENANCE OF VALUE OF
CURRENCY HOLDINGS

Prior to 1 April 1978, the effective date of the Second
Amendment to the IMP Articles, the Bank implemented
maintenance of value in respect of holdings of member
currencies in terms of 1966 dollars, in accordance with the
provisions’ of Article 25 of the Charter and relevant resolutions of the Board of Directars. The “Armounts required to

maintain value of currency holdings” under “RECEIVABLE.
PROM MEMBERS” represent the aggregate amounts recelvable resulting from changes in exchange rates of member currencies from those previously used for the purpose
of computing maintenance of value of the Bank's haldings
of certain member currencies. The settlement of such
amounts is not determinable and, accordingly, it is not
practicable to fair value these receivables.

Since 1 April 1978, inasmuch as the valuation of the
Bank's capital stock and the basis of determining possible
maintenance of value obligations are still under consideration, notional arnounts have been calculated! provisionally
as receivable from ar payable to members in order to
maintain the value of currency holdings in terms of the
SDR, The timing of any establishment and settlement of
such amounts is uncertain and, accordingly, it Is not practicable to fair value such receivables and payables. The
notlonal amounts as of 31 December 1994 consisting of
receivables of $621,581,000 ($541,006,000 '- 1993)

pald by members pursuant to Article 6, paragrajh 2(a) of
the Charter and of the convertible currency portion paid by
members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(b) of the
Charter as of 28 April 1973 to be used as a part of the
Special Funds of the Bank, The resources so set aside
amounting to $69,503,000 as of 31 December 1994

NOTE L ~ ORDINARY RESERVE AND
NET INCOME

Under the provisions of Article 40 of the Charter, the
Board of Governors shall delermine annually what part of
the net income shall be allocated, after making provision
for reserves, to surplus and what pari, if any, shall be
distributed to the inembers, During 1994 and 1993, net
income aller appropriation of guarantee fees to Special
Reserve for the years ended 31 December 1993 and

Oxlinary Reserve, except for $70,000,000 in 1994
($60,000,000 - 1993}, which was allocated to the Technical Assistance Special Fund,

The restatement of the capital stock for purposes of these
financial statements on the basis of the SDR instead of the
1966 dollar (see Note A) resulted in a net charge of
$29,627,000 to the Ordinary Reserve during the year
ended 31 December 1994 (net credit of $605,000 —
1993}. That charge (credit - 1993) is the increase

The discount rate used in determining the actuarial present
value of the projected benefit obligation was 8% (7% 1993). The effect of projected compensation levels was
calculated based on a scale that provides for a decreasing
rate of salary increase depending on age; beginning with
14% (13% ~ 1993) at age 21 and decreasing to 5.50%
(4.50% - 1993) at age 59. The expected long-term rate of

premiums for retirees, including retired members of the
Board of Divectors, and their eligible dependents who
elected to participate. The cost-sharing plan is currently
unfunded. For the year ended 31 December 1994, the
amount paid by the Bank for the retirees’ premiums was"
$389,000 ($403,000 - 1993).

Additional fair value information, inchiding methods used
to estimate certain values, is included in the noles referenced in the above table.

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the
amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a
current transaction between willing parties, other than in a
forced or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approxitnates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used io determine
lair values. Financial instrumnerits for which market quotations are not readily available are valued using methedologies and assumptions which: necessarily require the use of
subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at
which such financial instruments could be exchanged in a
survent transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is not determinable.

NOTE R ~- OFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT RISK

The Bank is a party to off-balance sheet financial instruments, These financlal instruments involve elements of
credit risk in excess of amounts reflected on the balance
sheet. Credit risk represents the maximum potential
ccounting less due to possible nonperformance by
obligors and counterparties under the terms of the
contract,

its members which are not reflected in the financial statements. As of 31 December 1994, guarantees outstanding
amounted to $145,112,000 ($132,306,000 - 1993).

NOTE A - GENERAL

The Asian Development Fund (the Fund) was established
on 28 June 1974 to carry out more effectively the special
operations of the Bank by providing resources on
concessional terms.

The resources of the Fund have been subsequently augmented by five replenishments, lhe most recent of which
was in August 1992 in a total amount equivalerit lo
US$4,200,000,000 io cover the operational requirements
for the four years ending 31 December 1995. An aggregate amount equivalent to $140,000,000 was allocated io
the Technical Assistance Special Fund.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currencies and Reparting Currency

The currencies of contributing members are functional
currencies, The reporting currency is the United States
dollar, and the financial statements are expressed in thotr
sands of currerit United States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabililies, amounts available for loan commitments
and advance payments on contributions are translated
from their functional currericies io the reporting currency
generally at the applicable rales of exchange at the end of a
reporting peried, Revenue and expense amounts are translated for each semi-monthly periad generally at the applica
ble rates of exchange at the beginning of each period; such
practice approximates the application of average rales in
effect cluring the period. Translation adjustments relating to
set-asicle resources {see Note G) are recorded as receivable
[rom or payable to Ordinary Capital Resources. Other
translation adjustments are charged or credited to “Aceumulaled translation adjustments”. Exchange gains or lasses
on currency transactions among functional currencies are
included tn revenue, a

Investments

The Bank adopted a new accounting standard for certain
investments in debt and equity secutities as of 31 December 1993, All investment securities held by the Bank are
considered by management to be available for sale and are
reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses excluded from revenue and reported in
“UNEXPENDED BALANCES AND CAPITAL”. Estimated
fair value generally represents market value. Cost or amortized cost is used to approximate fair value for certain
short-term investments nol traded in the market (time
deposits, etc.). Realized gains and losses are included in
revenue from investments and are measured by Lhe difference between average cost or amortized cost and the net
proceeds of sales.

Loans

Loans of the Fund are extended to eligible developing member countries, bear only a service charge and require repayment over periods ranging from 35 to 40 years, The Fund
requires borrowers to absorb exchange risks attributable to
fluctuations in the value of the currencies disbursed. It is the
policy of the Fund to place in non-accrual status all loans
made to eligible developing rnember counties if the principal
or service charges with respect to any such loan are overdue

‘by six months. Service charges on non-accruing loans are

included in revenue only to the extent that payments have
actually been received by the Fund. The Bank follows a
policy of not faking part in debt rescheduling agreements.

The Bank makes specific provisions for possible losses on
loans In which principal or service charges are in arrears
for one year for loans made to or guaranteed by a member
based on consideration by the Board of Directors; and six
months for loans to the private sector based on an evaluation by management of the collectibility of loans outstanding. On the remainder of the private sector portfolio, the
Bank makes a general loan loss provision at a rate
approved by the Board of Directors,

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority ajproved by the Board of Directors. The main investrnent
management objective is to maintain security and liquidity.
Subject to these parameters, the Bank seeks the highest
possible return on its investments.

NOTE D ~ LOANS

The principal amount outstanding of loans placed in non
accrual status as of 31 December 1994 was $33,903,000
($31,086,000 - 1993) ef which $5,079,000
($3,599,000 — 1993) was overdue. Overdue charges on
these loans totalled $1,115,000 ($680,000 - 1993).
Placing these loans in a non-accrual status resulted. in a
reduction of $364,000 ($796,000 - 1993} in revenue
from loans for.the year ended 31 December 1994. The
loans in non-accrual status as of 31 December 1994 and
31 December 1993 were loans made to Afghanistan,

The Fund has not suffered any loan losses on loans macle to
or guaranteed by members or their governments to date.
To date, no loan loss provisions have been made against
loans outstanding guaranteed by members or their governments, but loan loss provisions amounting to $824,000

($649,000 - 1993) have been made against private sector

loans. (See Note H.}

Loans are fair valued using an entry value method, Under
this method, fair value is determined based ot the Lerms at
which a similar loan would currently be made by the Bank
to a similar borrower, For such loans, fair value approximates the carrying amount. The estimated fair value of
loans is not affected by credit risks because the amount of
any such adjustment is not considered to have a material
effect based on the Bank's experience with its borrowers.

NOTE E.~ NOTES OP CONTRIBUTORS

Notes of contributors are non-negotiable, non-interestbearing and, subject to certain restrictions imposed by

ADF-6

CONTINUED

applicable Board of Governors’ resolutioris, encashable by
the Bank at par upon demand.

The Bank currently expects that the notes outstanding at
31 December 1994 will be encashed in varying amounts
over the eight-year period ending 31 December 2002.

Notes of contributors are fair valued using an entry value
method whereby fair value is determined based on the
terms at which notes are currently being accepted from
contributors. On this basis, fair value of outstanding notes
of contributors approximates carrying amount.

NOTE F - ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND
ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

Administrative expenses include an administration charge
amouriling to $75,485,000 ($74,647,000 + 1993), The
charge represenls an apporlionmert of all administrative
expenses of the Bank (other than those appertaining
directly to ordinary operations and special operations)
based on the number of loans and equity investments
approved for ihe year.

NOTE G - SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1(i) of
the Articles of Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank {the Charter}, the Board of Governors has
authorized the setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired
“paid-in” capital paid by members pursuant to Article 6,
paragraph 2(a) of the Charter and of the convertible curyency portion paid by members pursuant to Article 6,
paragraph 2(b) of the Charter as of 28 April 1973, to be
used as a part of the Special Funds of the Bank, The
capital so set aside was allocaled and transferred from the
Ordinary Capital Resources to the Fund as Set-Aside Resources.

The capital stock of the Bank is defined in Article 4,
paragraph 1 of the Charter, “in terms of United Stales
dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on 31 January
1966" (the 1966 dollar), Therefore, Set-Asicle Resources
had historically been translated into the current United
States dollar (the Bank’s unit of account}, on the basis of its

par value in terms of gold. From 1973 vatil 81 March
1978, the rate arrived at on this basis was $1.20635 per
1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978, al which time the Second
Amendment to the Articles of Agreernent of the Interna
tional Monetary Fund {IMP} came into effect, currencies no
longer have par values tn terms of gold. Pending the
Bank’s selection of the appropriate successor ta the 1966
dollar, the Set-Aside Resources has been valued for purposes of the accompanying financial slaternents in terms
of the Special Drawing Right {SDR}, at the value in current
Uniled States dollars as cornputed by the IMF. As of 31
December 1994, the value of the SDR in tenns of the
current United States dollar was $1.45985 ($1.37356 1993). On this basis, Set-Aside Resources amounted to
$69,503,000 ($65,395,000 -- 1993), If the capital stock
of the Bank a3 of 31 December 1994 had been valued in
terms of $12,063.50 per share, Set-Aside Resources
would have been $57,434,000.

NOTE H ~ PRIVATE SECTOR

Private sector loans outstanding as of 31 December 1994
were $16,207,000 ($15,569,000 - 1993), net of accurnulated provision for loan losses as of 31 December 1994
of $1,473,000 ($649,000 - 1993}, while undisbursed
loan commitments were nil ($269,000 - 1993).

NOTE I~ FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as [he amount
at which the instrument could’ be exchanged In a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidalion sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine fair
values. Financial instruments for which market quotations
are not readily available are valued using methodologies
and assumptions which necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which
such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current
transaction or whether they ave actually exchangeable is
not determinable.

The Fund's balance sheet carrying amounts are considered
fo approximate fair values for all significant financial
inslruments. Sea Notes B, D and E for discussions with
respect to investmenis, loans and notes of contributors,

corintitted, the utilized portions are translated at the applicable exchange rates as of the respective dates of use
whereas the unutilized portions are translated at the applicable exchange rates as of the end of a reporting period,
with resulling translation adjustments included in contributions committed. Revenue anid expense arounts in curren:
cies other than United States collars are translated lor each
semi-monthly period generally at the applicable rates of

ments and are measured by the difference between average
cost or amortized cost and the net proceeds of sales.

Contributions

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 1994 and 31 December 1993

government guaranteed obligations during the year ended

$4,000 ($38,000 and $1,000 - 1993}, respectively, were
realized on such sales.

The annualized rate of return on the average investments
held during the year, based on the’ portfolio held at the
beginning and end of each month, excluding unrealized
gains and losses, was 2.60% (3.81% - 1993).
{nvestments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors. The main investment
management objective is f¢ maintain security a id Jiquidity,
Subject to these parameters, the Bank seeks the highest
possible return on ils investments.

NOTE D - FUNDING

Since 1967, contributions have been made by 31 member
countries. In February 1992, the Board of Governors, in
authorizing a $4,200,000,000 replenishment of the ADF,
provided for an allocation to the TASF in an aggregate
amount equivalent to $140,000,000 to be used for techni
cal assistance to poorer developing members and for re
gional technical assistance. This replenishment became
affective in August 1992,

The Board of Governors allocated $70,000,000 from the
1993 net income of the OCR to the TASF In 1994 and
$60,000,000 from the 1992 net income in 1993.

NOTE E - SERVICES TO MEMBER COUNTRIES
The Bank’s outstanding cormmitmerits for grart-financed

technical assistance projects and programs totalled
approximately $94,525,000 as of 31 December 1994.

 

 

_—~ anna nese re nsnier ta

($103,740,000 - 1993). Technical Assistance Special |

Fund resources are used for these commitments. The fair

value of such comrnitments approximates the arnounis.

outstanding because the Bank expects that grants will be
rade for all projects and programs covered by the commitments. When technical assistance provided as a project
preparatory grant leads to a Bank loan, the amount of the
grant exceeding $250,000: will be refinanced under the
loan, Refinanced amounts of $425,000 ($1,000 — 1993)
were charged to loans and credited to revenue from other
sources of the TASF during the year ended 31 December
1994, . :

NOTE F ~ FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is detined as the ammount
at which the instrument could be exchanged In a current
transaction between willing parlies, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale,

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted raarket values are used to determine fair.

values. Financia! instruments for which rarket quotations
are not readily available are valued using methodologies
and assumptions which necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actua) value at which
such firiancial instruments could be exchanged in a current
transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not determinable.

The Fund’s balance sheet carrying amounts are considered
to approximate fair values for all significant financial
instrurnents, See Notes B and E for discussions with
respect to investments and services to member countries,
respectively.

programs totalled approximately $103,582,000 as of 31
Decernber 1994 ($81,083,000 ~ 1993). The fair value of
such commitments approximates the amounts outstanding
because JSF expects that disbursements will substantially
be made for all the projects and programs covered by the
comriliments,

NOTE F - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the
amount at which the instrument could be exchanged ina
current transaction belween willing parties, other than in a
forced or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts,

If available, quoted market values are used lo determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued using methodologles and assumptions which necessarily require the use of
subjective judginents. Accordingly, the actual value at
which such financial instruments could be exchanged in a
current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is not determinable.

The Fund's balance sheet carrying arnounts are considered
to approximate fair values for all significant financial instruments, See Notes B and E fer discussions with respect to
nivestinents, equily investments and services to member
coururies, respectively,

WATER — A VERY BASIC HUMAN NEED: Millions of people face difficulties obtaining fresh water for domestic purposes
like drinking, cooking and washing, as illustrated by a typical vitage well scene In Burma (Front Cover), The Bank has supported water supply development in Burma with loans for the Rangoon Water Supply Project and technical assistance grants
to ihe Rangoon and Mandalay Water Supply Projects. The supply of water to the Agriculture sector through improved irrigation is also an important feature of Bank lending. Under the Agricultural Credit Project in Bangladesh, for example, about

14,000 poor farm families will benefit from improved farm-level irrigation facilities through the provision of shaliow tubewells
and pumps (Back Cover)., ‘eee:

1973), the Multi-Purpose Special Fund {prior to 1980) and the Asian Development Fund (after 1973), but excludes resources of the Technical Assistance Special Fund.
Commitments from these resources, after ailowing for exchange rate adjustments, cancallations and repayments, totalled $2,476 million as of 31 Dacembey 1980.THE BANK IN 1980

DURING 1980, the Bank once again expanded its lending
and technical assistance activities and further strengthened its deveiopmental roie in the Asian and Pacific region.

The Bank continued to accord high priority to agriculture
and energy development. It also paid special attention to
meeting the basic human needs of the poor in its developing member countries (DMCs). Co-financing and technical
assistance were also maintained at a high level.

Bank tending during the year reached $1,436 million compared with $1,252 million in 1979 and $660 million in 1975.
Total disbursements amounted to $579 million during the
year compared with $486 miliion in 1979 and $362 million in
1975. The average size o* loans rose from $21.6 million in
1972 to $24.3 miilion in 1980.

Reflecting the Bank's concern for the basic needs of the
poor, 33 loans totalling $696 miilion were made to improve
farm output, education, health, sanitation anc water supply. During the year, the Bank approved its first two sector
joans. This type of lending is designed to facilitate quicker
transfer of resources, incréase the absorptive capacity of
DMCs and strengihen institution-ouilding. The Bank also
undertook a Regiona! Energy Survey which will help it
determine country oriorities and plan its lending and
technical assistance for energy development. Moreover, cofinancing of $16.3 million was arranged with commerciai
banks for two power projects in Repubiic of Korea and
Thailand.

During the year, the Bank staried a review of its future
resource requirements with a view to determining the appropriate quantum of increase in its capital stock through a
Third General Capita! Increase and of the Third Replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (ADF) — the Bank's
sofi ioan window — covering the period beyond 1982. The
Bank also undertook seven borrowings, amounting to the
equivalent of $457.8 miklion, in the world's major capital
markets.

LENDING ACTIVITIES: During ine year, the Bank approved $9 loans for 58 arejects in 17 OMCs, compared with
58 loans for 54" projecis in 18 DMCs in 1979. Loans from or
7 Excludes thres on-going crojects for which suppiemeniary Icans to Meet
COSI overruns we's approved.

dinary capital resources (OCR) in 1980 amounted to about
$958 million, an increase of 14.8 per cent over the corresponding figure of $835 million in 1979, while loans from
Special Funds (SF), amounting to $477 million, snowed
almosi the same percentage increase over ihe 1979 concessional lending figure of $416 million.

in 1980, 88 per cent of SF loans were to DMCs which had
a per capita GNP of less than $300 in 1979, anc 33 loans —
representing 64 per cent of all concessional lending anc 41
per cent of OCR lending during the year — were specifically
oriented towards benefitting the poor, particularly in the
provision of basic human needs

The tota! cost of projects approved for Bank financing in
1980, excluding six development finance institution (DFI)
projects, iwo secior loans and two program ioans, was
estimated at $3.561 million, of which about 33.4 per cent
was met by direct Bank financing. On the basis of the
Bank's past experience, it is estimated that the total cost of

estimated total investment cost of $192 million.

During the year, 22 Bank-financed projects involved cofinancing, with funds contributed by co-financlers amounting to $391 mitlion and those by the Bank to $600 million.
This compares with 24 projects co-financed in 1979 for
which co-financiers contributed $431 million and the Bank
$723 million, As in the pasi, the bulk of the Bank's cofinancing in 1980 was with official sources, both bilateral
and multilateral, which together contributed $343 millon or
88 per cent of the total. In addition, four projects amounting
io $62 million were processed by the Bank during the year
for exclusive financing by other sources,

LENDING BY SECTOR: In view of the importance of
agriculture and rural development in regional socioeconomic growth, particularly in the low-income DMCs, the
Agriculture and Agro-Industry sector once again received
high priority in Bank lending activities in 1980. The second
major sectoral focus was on the development of the Energy
sector, particularly on the increased utilization of indigenous energy resources. Bank lending to these two sactors has steadily risen in recent years, both in terms of
amounts and as shares of total lending (see Graph on page
34). Another important area of activity was the development
of social infrastructure such as potable water, urban
development, health care and education.

Bank lending during the year generally followed this
broad sectoral strategy, with 32.6 per cent of total lending
for the year going to the Agriculture and Agro-Industry sector, compared with 32.9 per cent in 1979. The Energy sector
received 26.5 per cent of total lending during 1980, compared with 26 per cant in 1979. Bank lending for energy was
mainly channelled into the development of indigenous
energy resources such as hydropower, natural gas and
lignite, the improvement of load despatch capacity and
rural electrification.

Social infrastructure projects accounted for 15.9 percent
of the year’s lending, compared with 19.3 per cent in 1979,
for the development of such facilities as public health, rural
water supply, sewerage, vocational education and training,
and urban housing; 15.6 per cent went to the Transport and
Communications sector (9.2 per cent in 1979) and the remaining 9.3 per cent to industry and Non-Fuel Minerals and
Development Banks, compared with 12.6 per cent in the
previous year.

Agriculture and Agro-Industry: The Bank continued to
increase the volume of its lending to this sector (which
covers irrigation and rural development, fisheries,
livestock, agricultural credit and support services, forestry.
fertilizer and agro-processing) in 1980. In doing so, the Bank
aimed at alleviating the widespread underemployment and
unemployment and poverty among rural populations, the
unsatisfactory performance of agricultural production and
distribution systems, inadequate implementation
capacities at both government and grassroots levels, and
continuing neglect of certain vital eco-systems in many of
its DMCs.

The Bank adopted a new policy framework for Bank
Operations in the Agriculture Sector in the South Pacific,
and formulated guidelines on Logical Framework Planning
and Project Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation. It also continued to encourage diversified cropping and paid special
attention to strengthening rural institutions and to ensuring increased participation of smaltscale farmers and
landless workers in Bank-assisted projects. ln addition to
its own lending and technica! assistance activities, the
Bank also processed several ioans for exclusive financing
by other aid agencies.

During the year, Bank lending to this sector amounted to
$468 million for 22 projects, compared with $412 million for
21 projects in 1979. Technical assistance amounted to $9.8
million for 30 projects, compared with $7.7 million for 30
projects in 1979. Cumulative lending to this sector at the
end of 1980 amounted to $2,264 million for 152 projects,
while technical assistance amounted to $41.6 million for
188 projects.Energy: Recent steep incveases in petroleum prices
and the continuing uncertainty of its worldwide supply
nave adversely affected tne economies of many DMCs, the
majority,o% which are depencent on oii-cerived enegy ‘or 75
ser cent of their commercia: neecs.

Tne Bank and 11s DMCs have tong recognized the key role
that energy clays in social anc economic ceve.opment. For
this reason, the Bank has given spéciai suppor: to the corstruction of hydroelectric power plants, gas fie'c developmeni, gas piperines, geothermal power units, rural ¢'ectrificatior systems and other crojects Girectad at increasing the DMCs’ indigenous ‘energy supply anc assisting
them to formulae policies and programs whicn are conducive to efficient use ance conservation of energy

The Bank aiso uncertook a Regional Energy Survey in
1980 which ‘ocused on such issues as the avdilaburty of
and demand jo: specific ene’gy resources, ihe lications
of increasing energy cosis ‘or economic growth, invest
ment needs, and institutional ard policy matiers.

Bank ioans to the Energy sector in 1980 amounted to
$382 muhor. for nine arejects — five for energy utilization
and four for energy-resource cevelopment — compared
with $325 millior tor 10 projects in 1979. Cumulative Energy
sector iending at the enc of the year amounted to $1,963
miliion, comprising 83 projects.

 

 

   

 

 

 

Industry and Non-Fuel Minerals: Industrializazion can
play a major role in accelerating economic development in
the Bank's DMCs by helping imorove balance o* payments
througr imoort substitution and/or expor diversification,
and generating greater empioyment opportunities. The
Bank’s sirategy is to help DMCs ceveiop their basic industnies by direct iending for large-scale projects and by indirect lending through deveionment Danks which are involvec ir the promotion of sma'l and medium-scale industries.

Higher imported fuel costs have encouraged many DMCs
to intensify the searcn for untapped mineral! resources
which coulc save and earn foreign exchange, and tne Bank
heios its DMCs carry out geciogical surveys to seek out and
prove these resources wiitn a view to facilitating their
systematic exploitation. In- 1980, tne Sank aporovec a concessicnal ioan of $6.2 miilion for a Geclogical Survey in
Bangladesh, and extended six technical assistance grants
amounting to $939,000 ‘cr non-fuel mineral development:
one each in Burma, Indonesia, Philippines anc Thailand,
anc two in Sri Lanka.

 

 

 

Development Banks: Sank Ioans to OFls enable the
cispersal of medium and long-term ds to smaler projects and enterprises beyond the reach cf direct Bank
assistance. Such credits also serve to strengtnen the financiat ang institutional capabilities of tne DFis themselves,
thus maxirg them more effective instruments ‘or the
mobilization of domestic and foreign resources.

During the year, the Bank made s:x toans to OFls,
amounting to $127 million, These credits rangec from two
$40 miitior loans to DFis in Pakistan and Republic of Korea
iS & $Z milion credit to the Develooment Bank of Solomon
islands. At the end of 1980, the Bank nad aporevec 56 credit
ines amounting to :06 miliion 10 25 development banks
int? DMCs.

 

 

 

  

 

Transport and Communications: in this sector, the
Bank continued to support oroiects which heip integrate
the rurai sector into the total economy and raise the pro
ductive capacity and income of ine rura population above
subsistence levels. in 1980, the Bank aporoved @ secre:
loan to assist the Government of Thailand impiemect its
Highway Seczor Developmen: Plan. The objectives of the
plan are to upgrade rural roads. improve the country’s road
infrastructure, anc strengthen relevant insiitutions.

During the year, tine loans emounting to $223 millon
were aopreved in the Transport anc Co wn-cations sector, four igans for derts pvaiects accounting *o: £0 per cent,
anc another five for road projects. At tne end of 1986, the
Banx had mace 88 loans amounting 10 $+,281 miiior for 79
projects in this sector, Within tne sector, roags anc ports
projects veceivec the major share of funding witr 56 der
cent ano 32 per cent, respectively, followed by airports {7
per cent), railways (4 per cent) and te:ecommunications (i
per cent).

 

 

 

Water Supply and Sewerage: A iargeé majority of people, oarticulariy in the Bank's poorest OMCs, are without
reasonable ascess to a Safe and adequate waier Supaiy,
and an even greater number lack proper sanitation. The
least deveicped countries are ihe mosi affected, and tneir
poor the worst sufferers. The Bank p:ans to become. increasingiy involved in the Water Suppiy and Sewerage sector, and attaches c iderab:e importance to ine provision
of water supply tc impoverished rural areas.

In 1980, the Bank approved its jirst secio: !can for water
supaiy, amounzing to $32 million, for a projec: in Inconesia
which wil: provide potacie water to 33 smali towns and Aelp
strengthen the insiiiutional capabilities of ihe country's
water Supply sector.

Five loans totaliing $107 miliion were approved for water
supsiy and sewerage in 1980. Total iending to this sector by
the end of 1980 nad reachec $706 miilion, comprising 36
projects in 13 DMCs.

 

  

 

 

 

 

Urban Development: Operations in the urban sector
have been designed to assist DMCs develop strategies for
future urban growth (with the Bank acting as a catalyst in
impiementing such strategies by financing projects and
providing technical assistance} anc to improve the capacity
of local institutions for efficient urban management.

Two loans approved during tne year wili help construct,
among other things, adout 6,500 iow-cost rental apartments, a fire station, an ambulance depot and two primary
anc secondary schools in Hong Kong, and wil: provide iowcost accommodation for adout 30,006 people in Thailand in
one of the four new towns included in tne Greater Bangkok
Masier Plan. At the end of 1980. the Bank nad approved
seven loans amounting to $140 million to the Uroan
Development sector.

Education: Bank assistance for ecucation has increased markediy in recent years, chiefly with a view io accelerating improvements to the quality o* seiecied educational programs which help augment manpower resources
and upgrade occupational skills in DMCs. To cate. the
Bank’s lending and technical assistance have tended to
concentrate on technical and vacationai education, re*lecting its suopori of educational development in coordination
with overa:! development neecs. .

During the year, the Banx approved three loans amcuating to $65 million for education. These covered the duilding
and equipsing of additional secondary vocationai schools
in Maiaysia, the provision of additional (and the upgradingof existIng) senior technical schools and teacher training
facilities in Indonesta, and the provision of new (and the
upgrading of existing) facilities for the training of skilled
workers at vocational institutes and the training of
teachers of vocational and trade skills in Singapore. Educatlonal fellowships to upgrade the skills of teachers featured
in all three projects, and in two of them provision was made
for the revision and upgrading of curricula and the introduction of the teaching of new technologies through the use of
educational consultants.

At the end of 1980, the Bank had approved 16 loans
amounting to $214 million for education. it had also extended $2.4 million in technical assistance for 15 projects in this
sector.

Health: Helping OMCs improve medical facilities and
overail health care has become an increasingly important
part of the Bank's development strategy in recent years.
Quite apart from the social justification of extending such
facllitles to the millions of poor in the Bank’s region, improved health has a definite — if not fully quantifiable —
impact on the quality of the labor force.

During the year, the Bank approved its first Public Health
Program loan, $15.6 million from ADF for a program which
alms to increase the supply of essential drugs and
strengthen malaria contro! operations in Bangladesh. The
Bank also extended technical assistance to four DMCs —
Bangladesh, Burma, Indonesla, and Papua New Guinea —
for studles covering the entire range of health services,
planning and delivery, Including upgrading of hospitals and
rural health centers, drug production and distribution, proviston of medical equipment and supplies and manpower
training. Technical assistance for Bangiadesh will also
help review Government plans to expand population contro! programs as well as Its preventive and curative health
care services. Cumutatlve lending to the Health sector at
the end of 1980 had reached $54 milllon for three projects,

LENDING RATE: The Bank's lending rate on ordinary
loans was set at 8.10 per cent per annum effective 4
January 1980. The rate was revised upward in July to 9.00
per cent and remained unchanged for the rest of the year.

DISBURSEMENTS AND LOAN ADMINISTRATION:
Loan disbursements from ordinary capital resources and
Special Funds totalled $579 million during 1980, against
$486 miilion In the preceding year. Disbursements from or
dinary capital resources amounted to $428.7 million {$361
million in 1979) and, from Special Funds, $150.3 million
($125 miilion in 1979). As of the end of 1980, total
disbursements were $2,304.7 million from ordinary capital
resources and $737.7 million from Speciai Funds.

A totat of 325 loans were under implementation in 1980
with 52 becoming effective during the year. A total of 15
projects were completed In 1980.

The thrust of the Bank’s loan administration activities in
1980 was directed towards Strengthening project monitoring and supervision. Improvements have been introduced in
the Bank's internal reporting system and review procedures

During the year, the Bank conducted studies on general
implementation problems encountered in some DMCs
Discussions on strengthening central Project implementation agencies were held with concerned officials in two bor:
rowing DMCs and the possibility of the Bank extending
technical assistance for this purpose is being examined.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: During the year, the Bank
provided technical assistance, other than regionat
technical assistance, for 56 projects, compared to §7 projects In 1979, whlle the total amount increased to $14.2
million from $13.9 million in the previous year (see Table on

These amounts include technical assistance grants incorporated in nine Bank loans, totalling $6.7 miltion, of which
$1.3 million was for project preparation and $4.8 million for
advice and implementation.

On a sectoral basis, 69.2 per cent of the total amount of
technical assistance approved in 1980 was for Agriculture
and Agro-Industry, compared with 55.4 per cent in 1979 (see
Table on page 51). About 7.2 per cent was provided to the
Energy sector, covering natural gas distribution and rural
mini-hydropower, 7.1 per cent to the Industry and Non-Fuet
Minerals sector including Development Banks, 3.1 per cent
to the Transport and Communications sector and the rest
to Water Supply, Education and Health.

A total of 37 technical assistance projects was completed in 1980, 26 for project preparation and.i1 for advisory and operational purposes, bringing the total number

of technical assistance projects completed to 251. The
total amount of technica! assistance grants provided to
DMCs as of the end of 1980 stood at $75 million.

REGIONAL ACTIVITIES: During the year, the Bank was
involved in an increasing number of regional activities.
These included a Regional Energy Survey; Regional
Seminars on Procurement and Project Implementation
Management; a Regional Seminar on Road Maintenance; a
Fifth Regional Program -on Development Banking; and a
Training Course on Project Management. The Sank also
held a Regional Seminar on Planning. Management and
Evaluation of Technical/Vocational Education; a Regional
Program on Project Implementation and Supervision; and a
Regional! Program on Industria! Project Appraisal —
Marketing and Economic Aspects. During the year, the
Bank’s South Pacific Agricultural Survey was published
and a preliminary siudy initiated to assess agricultural
research facilities and needs in the South Pacific.

 

POST-EVALUATIGON: During 1980, the role of postevaluation was further strengthened as an integral part of
the Bank’s operations. The Posi-Evaluation Office continued to focus on the preparation of Project Performance
Audit Reports (PPARs) which evaluate, verify and audit the
findings of Project Completion Reports prepared by the
respective Project Departments. The purpose of the PPARs
is to assess completed projects independently in terms of
their design, implementation and achievement of stated objectives. The findings and recommendations of PPARs are
examined by the Bank with a view to improving its future
operations. During 1980, 13 Post-Evaiuation Reports were
completed. These reports covered 17 Bank loan and
technical assistance projects.

 

POLICY REVIEWS: In an effort to respond more effectively to the changing needs of the region, the Bank carried
out several reviews of its lending policies during the year.
These covered the Bank's lending and relending policies,
sector lending, streamlining the loan and technical
assistance processing work of the Bank, arrangements for
ADF lending and the OCR lending program for 1980-82.

The Bank also undertook a broad review of its role in
assisting the economic development of its DMCs in the
1980s and commenced a review of its resource requirements during the period 1983-87. In 1980, the Bank
also reviewed papers on Environmental! Considerations in
Bank Operations and on a Framework for Public Utility
Tariff Provisions.

ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES: The authorized
capital stock of the Bank as of 31 December 1980 stood at
$9,209.2 million (SDR 7,220.6 million}, of which the subscribed portion amounted to $8,828.1 million (SDR 6,921.7
million). .

As to the progress of the Second General Capital Increase, 40 member countries had made subscriptions,
amounting to $4,913.8 million (SDR 3,852.7 million), as of 31
December 1980. During 1980, Italy and Kiribati took up their
full capital subscription entitlements, amounting to $86.1
milion (SDR 67.5 million) and $0.3 million (SOR 0.2 million),
respectively. The United States also made a further partial
subscription of $162.6 miition (SDR 127.4 million) in 1980."

During the year, the Bank undertook seven borrowings?
amounting to the equivalent of $457.8 million. Although the
adverse conditions in mosi major capital markets made
selection and timing of borrowings particularly difficult, the
Bank was able to arrange the borrowings on comparatively
favorable terms. Furthermore, the Bank was abie to continue its efforts to secure longer maturities, and for the second year in succession arranged a long-term syndicated
joan in Japan. This was the Bank's largest borrowing ever
in the private capitat markets in Japan. The average maturity of the year's borrowings, weighted by amount, was 10.01
years, compared with 10.25 years in 1979.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND: At the end of 1980, 14
donor countries had deposited Instruments of Contribution
to the second Asian Development Fund replenishment
(ADF II). In July, the first instalment of the United States

1 in February 1981, the United States made @ further sudscription of $252.4
milion {SOR 208.8 mi:lion}.
2 One of these was signed in February 1981.contribution and the second instalments of the other con
tributions to ADF Ill became available for joan com
mitments, thereby providing the Bank with adequate
resources for its 1980 concessional lending program.

4m .accordance with Governors’ Resolution No. 134,
adopited at the Thirteenth Annual Meeting in 1980, the Bank
started a review of future ADF resource requirements with a
view to reaching agreement with donor countries in the
course of 1981 as to the appropriate scale of the next ADF
replenishment (ADF tV), which will cover the period beyond
1982,

Total ADF resources at the end of 1980 amounted to
$2,916 milllon. Loan commitments from these resources
amounted to $2,476 million, leaving a balance of $440

‘million, of which about $301 million remained available for

loan commitments after allowance for exchange rate fluctuations.

OUTLOOK: Developments in the world economy during
the past year, such as the recession in the industrialized
countres, Inflation, rising oll prices, and the higher costs of
commercial borrowing on which several developing countries have to depend, have all adversely affected the Bank’s
OMCs, particularly the tow-income countries. Because of
the current and prospective impact on DMC economies of
these developments, the external resource requirements of
the Bank’s borrowing countrles will be greater than in
previous years if they are to deal in an acceptable manner
with the widespread problems of poverty, rapid population
growth, unemployment, hunger and malnutrition.

While the uncertainties in the current international
economic situation do not permit precise projections of
resource requirements for the future, some of the main
issues involved for national developmentat priorities in the
1980s and for necessary supportive Bank lending priorities
are clearly evident.

In the early 1980s, the Bank must continue to give strong
Support to food production and rural development, partleularly since the key to reducing Poverty and increasing
employment is to spur growth in these sectors. The Bank
will accord higher priority to energy development, given the
anticipated continued increases in energy costs and the
prospect of possible supply constraints. Such Bank support must cover the exploration and development of Indigenous energy sources, research and development of
renewable energy, energy conservation and low-cost

energy development. The Bank’s Regional Energy Survey,
which will be completed in 1981, wilt help to determine
future investment and lending priorities in this sector.

In addition, the Bank will continue to assign particular
importance to meeting basic human needs and enhancing
human resources in its DMCs through increased lending for
social infrastructure — health, education and the like.

The Bank will aiso examine other techniques, such as
equity investments and guarantee operations as well as expanding its co-financing arrangements. Similarly, the Bank
will enlarge the scope of its sector and program lending
and local-cost financing operations, and, as a measure to
improve loan administration and resource transfers, consideration will be given to the need for the establishment of
one or more resident offices in OMCs on an experimental
basis.

As regards future resource needs of DMCs, preliminary
Bank estimates indicate that their aggregate external
resource requirements wilt increase in Current prices from
about $27 billion in 1980 to $50 billion in 1987 and to $63
billion in +990. Low-income DMCs are projected to account
for about 23 per cent of the total resource needs of DMCs in
1990, lower-middle income countries for 39 per cent, and
upper-middieshigh-income countries for about 38 per cent.

These projections are conservative given the uncertainties of price and other economic conditions in the 1980s.
Poor harvests could raise the volume of food imports; export prices and volumes may be depressed due to interna:
tional recession whiie import prices could be higher: and
debt burdens could become more heavy than presently anticipated. It should be noted that these projections are based on the assumption that the average annual increase of
oil prices in nominal terms will be about 10 per cent. For
most DMCs, oil imports havea relatively high weight in the
total import bill, and petroleum paymenis alone are projected to increase from $32.1 billion in 1980 to $83 billion in
1990.

The Bank's own resource requirements are currently
under study, as directed by the Board of Governors. In this
connection, the Bank must seek an increase in its
Tesources sufficient to support lending levels during the
period 1983-87 commensurate with the projected requirements of the DMCs. Proposals for a third increase in
the capital stock and a further replenishment of ADF
resources will accordingly be presented to member countries during 1981.- . HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BANK’S OPERATIONS, 1967-1980

THE GENERAL economic performance of most developing
member countries (DMCs) in 1980 compared untavorably
with that in 1979. The economic growth rate in many Countries was below that of the previous year, and well below
the average recorded during the 1970s. Compared with
4979, most OMCs experienced a higher infiation rate anda
deterioration in their balance of payments situation. Nevertheless, the recovery of agricultural produciion in the major
foodgrain producing DMCs was impressive and helped improve combined Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth toa
rate higher than in 1979 and favorably influenced the food
situation in several DMCs.

International Setting

Severa! adverse developments in the world economy in
4980 affected the economies of DMCs and gave cause for
great concern. There was a significant slowdown in the
growth of production, particularly in the industrialized
countries, leading to a reduction in tne growth of world
trade. Inflation in most countries accelerated over the
already high ievels of 1979, and very large imbalances
emerged in the current accounts of major groups of countries, presenting particular difficulties for non-oii developing countries in their efforts to sustain the financing of
their growing current account deficits. Recurrent heavy increases in oil prices over the past two years contributed
largely to the unfavorable condition of the world economy
in 1980.

Economic growth in the industrialized countries which
are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) fel! sharply to an average
GDP growth rate of only about 1 per cent during the year
compared with 3.5 per cent in 1979, reflecting accelerated
inflation rates and the restrictive policies introduced to
combat them. Consumer prices increased by an average of
9.4 oer cent in 1979 and 14.7 per cent in 1980, despite tight
fiscal and monetary policies. The large increases in oi!
nrices were directly refiected in the growing aggregate cur
rent account deficits of OECD countries: from a surplus of
$7.5 billion in 1978, this changed into a deficit of $33.7
billion in 1979 and swept to 2 $63.7 billion deficit in 1980.

CLEARING THE WAY for part of the Jerangau-Jabor Development
Road Project in the State of Trengganu on the East Coast of
Peninsular Malaysia, part of the Trengganu Tengah regional
development scheme which aims to provide overall economic
growth, redress regional imbalances and overcome economic and
social disparities among the peopte.

 

High oii import bills and slower GDP growth combined to
restrict import demand and internationa: trade, dotn of
which registered the slowest growth rates since 1975.

Due to increases in oil prices during 1979 and 1980, the
current account surolus of members of the Organization of
Petro:eum Exporting Coun:ries (OPEC) increased rapidly, at
about ihe same rate as in 1974. From oniy $4.5 bititon in
1978, their aggregate current account surolus soared to $68
billion in 1979 and is estimated at about $176 bition in 1980.
Furthe;y anticipated increases in oil prices and the relatively
successfui policies of many OPEC countrigs to curb excess
demand and avoid supply bottlenecks are expected to prevent future surpiuses from deciining as rapicty as they did
between 1974 and 1978. Overali GDP growth of OPEC countries in 1980 was likeiy to have been lower than that in 1979,
due to the disruption to off production and other economic
activities in Iran and lraa. resulting from armed hostilities
between ihese two OPEC members.

These international economic developments severely atfected the non-oil developing countries. particularly the
poorer nations. While higher prices of oil and other imports
inflated the vaiue of their imports, sluggish world demand
reduced the rate of growth of their exports. As a result, the
overall current account deficit of non-oli developing countries is estimated to have increased from $36 billion in 1978
to $56 billion in 1979 and +o about $72 billion in 1980. There
are indications that this very jarge deficit is likely to ine .
crease furthers in 1981. Furthermore, the dect service obligations of many of these countries are already heavy, their
Capacities to service much higher debt obligations and the
willingness of private financiai institutions to provide large
additiona! credits now appear uncertain. This underscores
the need for developing more effective means for recycling
funds from surplus OPEC countries to non-oii developing
countries on a systematic and sustained basis.

High imoort costs have aggravated the already high rates
of inflation prevailing in the non-oil developing countries:
the consumer price indices of these countries were
estimated to have increaseo on average by 25 per cent in
1978, 29 per cent in 1979 ang 36 per cent in 71980. High infla:
tion and sluggish demand for manufaciured exports led to
a decline in the overall growth in output in the non-oii
developing countries during 1980. For these countries,
average GDP growth in.1980 is estimated to have beenwriter ©

Awa gee dt

somewhat below the average of 4.2 per cent achieved in
1979

In addition, another major concern emerged during the
year in the form of possible shortfalls in the supply of
foodgrains fo meet the needs of the growing population in
the developing countries. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAQ) world cereal production estimates for 1980 —
1,437 million tons — are only § million tons higher than the
depressed production level of 1979 and substantially below
(hat of 1978. Poor harvests in many developed and developing couniries pushed cereal imports in 1980 to a record
level of about 205 million tons, nearly half of which was accounted for by developing countries. The highest rate of increase in imports (i7 per cent) was for the low-income
group of developing countries.

Prices of all cereals rose to their highest levels since
1975-76, the increases ranging trom about 7 per cent for
wheat and 25 per cent for rice between December 1979 and
December 1980. Cereals slocks are expected to decline to
about 210 million tons by ihe end of crop year 1980-81, a
drop of about 40 million tons in one year. These stocks,
which represent only 14 per cent of total consumption,
would constitute an inadequate buffer against possible major shortfalls during 1981.

Economic Developments in DMCs

The downturn In the world economy was reflected in the
key economic indicators of the Bank’s DMCs such as GDP
growth, manufacturing output, inflation rates and trade
deficit. A majority of DMCs had lower GDP growth rates in
1980, and in two of them GDP actualiy declined. A few
DMCs achieved GDP growth rate slightly higher than in the
previous year, while two DMCs (india and Indonesia) experienced significant increases. Inflation rates increased
markedly in virtually ali DMCs, The increased cost of oll and
other imports led to sharply higher trade and current account deficits in most non-oll DMCs, as their import
payments accelerated at a faster pace than the growth in
their export earnings. Many DMCs experienced a signiticant worsening of their terms of trade and the financing of
their current account deficits became increasingly
onerous.

Growth In GDP

The overall economic performances of DMCs measured
by changes in their GDP varied considerably during 1980,
as in the past (Table 1).' Indonesia and Malaysia, which are
net exporters of oil, registered high growth rates. In Indonesia, GDP growth increased from 4.9 per cent in 1979 to
6.9 per cent In 1980, while in Malaysia the growth rate in
1980 was 7.6 per cent as against 8.5 per cent in 1979, Apart
from greatly increased income from oil, good performances
both in agriculture and manufacturing contributed to the
impressive economic growth in these DMCs. Burma, a
marginal net exporter of oil among DMCs, maintained its
GDP growth rate at about the 6 per cent achieved in 1979,
sargely due to high production of rice — the principal
agricultural product — which reached a record level of 13
million tons (of paddy} in 1980. Expansion of acreage under
high-yielding varieties and good weather contributed to the
record rice output.

Among the South Asian countries, India and Pakistan
achieved higher GDP growth rates during 1980 than in the

previous year. The single most important contributing factor to the improvement in these countries was the impressive growth in agricultural production, which also promoted the demand for and the growth of manufacturing
and trading activities. Although official figures are not yet
available, an estimated 20 per cent increase in food production in India from the drought-depressed level of 1979 sug:
gests that GDP growth in that country during fiscal year
1980-81 may well be about 6-7 per cent compared with a 4.5
per cent decline in fiscal year 1979-80. In Pakistan, GDP
growth rate increased from 5.9 per cent in 1979 to 6.2 per
cent in 1980. GDP growth rate of Bangladesh remained at
aboui the 4.4 per cent achieved in fiscal year 1978-79, mainly because of the continued impact of drought on the
growth rate of the agricultural sector during the 1979-80
crop year, In Sri Lanka, GDP growth rate declined to 5.6 per
cent in 1980 from 6.3 per cent in 1979 largely due to lower
output of tree crops caused by the drought during early
1980. In Nepal, GDP declined by 1.4 per cent in 1980 from
the level of the previous year due to a severe drought which
affected the 1979-80 crop.

Among the newly industrialized DMCs, GDP growth of
Hong Kong and Singapore improved from 8.6 per cent and
9.3 per cent, respectively, in 1979 to 9 per cent and 10.2 per
cent, respectively, in 1980. Domestic construction booms
and efforts towards diversification of manufacturing production and exports helped both of these countries maintain the momentum of their GDP growth, On the other hand,
GDP growth in Republic of China feil below the level of the
previous year, while GDP of Republic of Korea declined in
absolute terms. The Republic of Korea, which until 1978
had achieved the highest GDP growth rate in the region, experienced the greatest fall. Its growth rate declined from11.3 per cent in 1978 to 7.1 per cent in 1979 and, ior the first
time in two decades, GOP in 7986 fell by 3.4 per cent below
thai of the previous year. GDP growth in the Republic of
China fell from 7.8 per cent in 1979 to 6.8 per cent in 1980.
For these countries, the main contributory factor was 2
slowdown in the growth of the manufacturing sector. A
reduction in agricultural production during 1980 (by 2.5 per
cent in Republic of China and 22 per cent in Republic of
Korea ) also affected tne GDP growth.

Among the other countries of Southeast Asia, both
Philippines and Thailand had lower GDP growth rates in
41960 for the second successive year, In the Philippines, the
reduction was comparatively small, declining from 5.8 per
cent in 1978 to 5.7 per cent in 1979 and 5.2 per cent in 1980.
In Thailand, the reduction during the same perioc was
much greater: from 10.1 per cent in 1978 to 7 per cen: in
4979 and 6 oer cent in 7980. In both cauniries, slower
growth in the manufacturing secior due to slack domestic
and export dernand was an important contributory fact ‘or.
In the Philippines, typhoons aisa adversely affected
agricultura! production and GDP growth.

For the remaining DMCs, no complete estimates of aggregate domestic output are as yet available. However, based on available information about production, exports and
commodity prices, it is possibie to infer the general trend in
some of the DMCs concerned. in the Socialist Republic of
Viet Nam, agricuitura! output is reported to have suffered
extensive damage from several typhoons in 1980. As a
result, overall GDP growth in 1980 is expected to have been
lower than in the previous year. Among South Pacific
DMCs, GDP growth rates in Fiji and Papua New Guinea are
likely to have been lower than in 1979 due to widespread
damage caused to the sugar crop by cyclones in the former,
and low world demand for copper, the principal export of
the latter. In Kiribati, GDP is estimated to have declined
sharply due to the discontinuation of the mining and export
of phosphate.

While economic performance in terms of GDP growth
varied considerably among DMCs during 1980, in overall
terms the average GDP growth rate of DMCs is expected to
have been higher in 1980 than in 1979 and aiso higher than
the average growth rate for other developing as well as
developed countries during the year. This is due to the large
weight of countries which did better in 1986 mainly due to a
marked recovery in agricultural production. Looking ahead,
ii would appear difficult for DMCs to increase substantially
agricutiural production over the normai or above norma!
levels achieved in 1980. At the same time, domestic and export demand for manufactures is likely to remain low, while
prices of oi] and other imports are expected to continue to
rise. The economic growth prospects for DMCs in the near
future, therefore, appear less than promising.

Sectoral Output

Performance in the agriculture sector was generally
satisfactory in DMCs during 1980. Tne imorovement is
largely explained by the recovery from below normal oraduction leveis in 1979, particularly in Bangladesh, India,
Pakistan and Thailand, as a result of favorabie weather.
However, better availability of inputs and greater emphasis

GRAINS OUTPUT OF DMCs, 1974-1980

 

 

 

 

 

The overall improved performance of the agriculture sector in 1980 was due to the substantiaily higher outpui of
foodgrains, mainly rice. Aggregate production of the three
principal foodgrains (rice, wheat and maize) increased by
10.7 per cent, reaching a total of 271.5 million tons in 1980
compared with 245.2 million tons in 1979. The regional increase in cereal production contrasts with the dectine in
the rest of the world and was well above the average
population growth rate in DMCs af about 2.2 per cent during 1980. The increase in foodgrain production in DMCs
was almost entirely accounted for by rice, tne production of
which, measured in terms of paddy, increased from 177.6
million tons in 1979 to 206.2 million tons in 1980, representing an increase of about 16.1 per cent (Tabie 2).° With the
exceptions of Republic of China, Republic of Karea and
Malaysia, ali major rice producing DMCs shared in this increase. Virtually the entire increase in world production of
rice during 1980 was accounted for by DMCs, which produce about 50 per cent of world rice output. Larger increases in output of rice were recorded by Bangladesh, Burma, India, indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and
Thailand. However, India alone accounted for 69 per cent
of the totai increase in DMCs.

Wheat output tn 1980 (46.5 million tons) was 5.5 per cent
below the level of 1979 (49.2 miilion tons). The decline in
wheat production in India by 3.9 million tons due to drought
in the 1979-80 crop year was only partially offset by higher
production in Bangladesh and Pakistan (Table 3).1 In
Bangiadesh, wheat production increased steeply from

494,000 tons in 1979 to 823,000 tons in 1980 and is becoming an important factor in reducing the food deficit in the
country. The production of maize in OMCs increased
marginally from 18.4 million tons to 18.7 million tons.

The below normal output of foodgrains in DMCs during
1979 led to lower per capita availability of foodgrains in
several DMCs during 1979 and early 1980, Increased food
aid, larger imports and drawdown of siocks were needed to
overcome the shortage. However, as the good 1980
harvests progressed in many DMCs, the situation eased
considerably by the end of the year. India substantially
replenished its depleted stocks which were drawn down
from about 20 million tons to about 10 million tons to meet
its own large 1979 shortfall in production and also to export
modest amounts to some DMCs facing shortages in food
supply. Several other DMCs were able to increase their
stock levels over those of the previous year, Indonesia and
Sri Lanka requested cancellation or slow delivery of
foodgrains ordered earlier because they faced storage problems. Bangladesh improved its stocks and repaid in kind
part of the foodgrains received from India in 1979. The improved stock positions of DMCs are expected to help provide a buffer against possible shortages in and beyond J98).

The growth of manufacturing sector output in DMCs remained generally depressed during 1980. Among the 11
OMCs for which relevant data are available, only Malaysia
and Pakistan registered significant improvements in the
growth of manufacturing production in 1980 compared with
1979, Fiji maintained its very high growth of manufacturing
ouiput achieved in 1979. The growth rate of manufacturing
production in Singapore continued to be high, despite a
slight decline in 1980. !n Republic of China, Indonesia and

Philippines, the growth rates of manufacturing sector output were about the same as the below normal rates of 1979.
During 1980, the growth of manufacturing production
sharply declined in Bangladesh, Republic of Korea and
Thailand, and in ladia the index of manufacturing production declined in absolute terms. The relatively less satisfactory performance of the manufacturing sector in many
DMCs during the year was due to a combination of factors.
These included reduced domestic demand, sluggish demand for DMCs’ export products in industrial countries and
the structural adjustment problems being faced by some industries in DMCs due to escalation in the prices of oil and
other industrial inputs.

in recent years, the production and management of
energy resources have become issues of major concern to
all olt-tmporting DMCs. This concern was heightened by the
increase in oil prices by about 150 per cent during the
period 1979-80. The cost of oi! imports for DMCs increased
from $13.5 billion in 1978 to $18.2 billion in 1979 and $32.1
billion in 4986 (Table 4). The DMCs, therefore, placed much
greater emphasis on the development of domestic sources
of energy. The resulis of current efforts will take some
years to be fully realized. Achievements during 1980 were
tather mixed. Total production of electricity — the single
most important source of commercial energy — increased
by 7.5 per cent from 256.1 billion kW in 1979 to 275.3 billion
KW in 1980. Excluding India, the overall growth rate was
11.1 per cent. While most DMCs shared in this increase,
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Lao Peopie’s Democratic Republic,
Philippines and Singapore registered the larger increases.

The known reserves of oil and/or gas increased
significantly during the year and india, Malaysia and
Thailand had the largest expansion In capacity. Actual
petroleum production in DMCs was, however, estimated to
have decreased by 4.2 per cent from 109.4 million tons in
1978 to 104.8 million tons in 1980. In indonesia and Philippines, output from existing wells declined. Oil and gas production in India was affected by the interruption in production in the northeastern part of the country, and Malaysia
deliberately held down the output of crude oil in accordance with its policy of delaying the depletion of oil
resources. DMCs endowed with natural gas resources emphasized the utilization of such energy to save on their oil
imports and to provide an additional source of export earn:
ings. Gas production among DMCs increased by 8.4 per
cent in 1980, The largest increases in gas production were
achieved by Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh while the
measures adopted by Thailand during the year wil! lead to
substantial gas output in the future.

Price Trends

Inflation rates in DMCs, which were already rising in
1979, further accelerated in 1980 {Table 5). Compared with
an average annual increase of 6.7 per cent in 1978, consumer price increases in DMCs averaged 11.6 per cent in
1979 and 15.6 per cent in 1980. The major contributory fac
- tors were the tight food situation during 1979 and early

1980 in some DMCs, worldwide inflationary pressures triggered by oil price hikes during 1979-80 and the expansionary monetary policies pursued by some DMCs during
1979. However, the average rate of inflation in DMCs in
1980, as in recent years, was considerably below that tor
other developing couniries.

ing the year. In Burma, the already moderate inflation rate
of 5.7 per cent in 1979 was reduced to 0.6 ver cent in 1980,
while Indonesia reduced its inflation rate trom 22 per cent
in 1979 (the highest rate among DMCs in that year) to 16 per
cent in 1980. Of the remaining DMCs for which consumer
price data are available, Malaysia and Singapore had single
digit inflation rates. India and Pakistan, which had deen
able to contain inflation at low rates of 6.3 per cent and 8.4
per cent, respectively, in 1979 experienced nigher inflation
rates of 10.7 per cent and 10.4 per cent, respectively, in
1980. The inflation rates were 15 per cent or more in
Bangladesh, Republic of China, Hong Kong, Republic of
Korea, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tonga and Western
Samoa; whiie in Nepa! and the South Pacific DMCs, other
than those mentioned above, inflation was between 10 per
cent and 15 per cent.

External Sector Developments

The DMCs had a record trade deficit of $17 billion in 1980,
as compared with the deficit of $11.1 billion incurred in the
preceding year (Table 6). Indonesia and Maiaysia — which
are major exporters of oil among DMCs — had large trade
surpluses in 1980 of $9.2 bitlion and $2.8 billion, respectively. Their combined surpius of $12 billion reduced the aggregate deficit of DMCs by nearly 41.3 per cent. Excluding
these countries, the deficit for the remaining OMCs increased from $18.6 billion in 1979 to $28 billion in 1980. Increased
oil import costs accountec for 124.6 per cent of the total increase in deficits for this group. The iarger trade deficit increases were recorded by Burma, India and Sri Lanka. India’s deficit rase from $1.9 billion in 1973 to $6.8 billion in
1980; while tne deficit of Sri Lanka increased from $467
million in 1978 to $845 million in 1986. Burma, a marginal

net exporter of oil, experienced a large increase in trade
deficit from $129 million in 1979 to $295 million in 1980. The
Republic of China's traditional iarge surplus was all but
wiped out for the first time in several years. Other DMCs
having very large increases in trade deficits in 1980 were
Bangladesh, Hong Kong. Nepal. Pakistan, Philippines,
Singapore and Thailand.

The aggregate exporis of DMCs increased by 28.3 per
cent from $107 billion in 1979 to $137.3 billion in 1980. This
was Delow the 30.3 per cent growth recorded in 1979. Hong
Kong, India, Indonesia, Republic of Korea and Singapore
are the major DMCs which maintained or improved upon
their export performance of the previous year. Republic of
China, Pakistan, Philippines and Thailand maintained fairiy
high growth rates in exports, although these rates were
below the level attained tn 1979. Among the remaining major DMCs, Bangiadesh, Burma and Malaysia experienced a
sharp fali in tne growth of exports, whereas Nepal and Sri
Lanka registered absolute reductions in the value of exports during 1980.

The total imports of DMCs increased by 30.7 per cent
trom $118.14 billion in 1979 to $154.4 billion in 1980, which
was higher than the increase of 28.5 per cent in 1979. The
major DMCs which had higher growth in imports in 1980
compared with that in the previous year were Bangladesh,
Burma, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan and
Singapore. In many DMCs, the lower growth rates ot imporis in 1980 — despite high oi! imports — were due to the
lower levei of food imports and/or the impact of lower GDP
growth on import demand.

During 1980, the totat cost of oi} imports is estimated at
$32.1 billion, or about 20.8 per cent of total imports.
However, this overall percentage greatly understates the

critical nature of the rising burden of oil imports for many
OMCs. The greatest impact has been on countries which
had stagnant export earnings but depended heavily on imported oil for their domestic energy needs. A more accurate
measure of this burden on DMCs Js reflected in the ratio of
oil imports to total commodity exports of DMCs. In 1980,
this ratio averaged 23.4 per cent for all DMCs, but was as
high as 56 per cent for India, 32 per cent for Republic of
Korea, 41 per cent for Nepal, 60 per cent for Pakistan, 34 per
cenit for Philippines, 46 per cent for Sri Lanka and 44 per
cent for Thailand. The increasing burden on DMCs of financing oi] imports may be illustrated by the corresponding
ratios in 1979: 17 per cent for all DMCs, 36 per cent for India,
21 per cent for Republic of Korea, 24 per cent for Nepal, 33
per cent for Pakistan, 30 per cent for Philippines, 21 per
cent for Sri Lanka and 30 per cent for Thailand. in the case
of Nepal and Sri Lanka, ihe decline in their exports in 1980
contributed to the rise in the ratio of oil imports to export
earnings.

During 1980, for most DMCs the export unit value index
increased only marginally, but the corresponding import
unit value index increased by a much greater extent,
leading to a decline in their terms of trade index. The major
exceptions were Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan. Their
export unit value indices increased during 1980 to a degree
which more than offset the increase in import value indices
during the year. .

The aggregate international reserves of OMCs increased
from $38.1 billion in 1979 to $43.8 billion in 1980 (Table 7).
The ratio of the reserves to the value of average monthly imports of DMCs, however, declined from 4.6 in 1979 to 4 in
1980. A substantial portion of the gains in reserves was accounted for by Indonesia whose reserves increased by $2.3

billion during the year. Other DMCs reporting significant increases in reserves included Burma, Republic of Korea,
Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines and Singapore.
Bangladesh, India, Thailand and several other DMCs _utilized varying amounts from their reserves to finance pari of
their respective large current account deficits and,
therefore, their reserves declined. The international
reserves of Bangladesh, Republic of China and Western
Samoa were low in relation to the value of their imports in
1979 and the ratio further dectined during 1980.

The data on aggregate debts of DMGs are not generally
published. Fairly adequate information on public debt is,
however, available for the period up to 1979. Reflecting the
continued inflow of external resources, the external public
debt outstanding of DMCs is estimated to have increased
from $67.6 billion in 1978 to $74.1 billion in 1979, or by 9.5
per cent (Table 8), The corresponding debt service
payments increased from $7.5 billion in 1978 to $9.1 billion
in 1979. The overall debt’ service ratio, however, decreased
from 7.7 per cent in 1978 to 7 per cent in 1979. There were
wide differences in the debt service ratios of individual
DMCs, ranging from nearly 6 (zero) in the case of Hong
Kong to about 22 per cent for Burma. These ratios relate to
official debt and, therefore, understate the debt service
burden of those DMCs, such as Republic of Korea and
Philippines, which were abie to raise substantial amounts
in debts not guaranteed by governments. Nevertheless, the
ratios reflect the relative debt burden of a majority of DMCs
which rely mosity on official loans. For many of these
OMGs, the debt service ratio remains low due to a high
grant element in the total inflow of their external resources.
For Burma, Pakistan and Western Samoa debt service
satios were very high in 1979. For several DMCs, the increase In debt service ratio was moderated or reversed due
to the exemptions or rescheduling of debt repayments
allowed in recent years by some donors.

Domestic Efforts and Policies of DMCs

Domestic and international economic difficulties during
the year posed great chailenges for the economies of
DMCs, calling for major policy initiatives and adjustments.
Faced by recession or stagnation in several major
developed countries which are important export markets
for DMCs, and continued quota restrictions and other nontariff barriers on their traditional exports of manufactured
goods, DMCs such as Republic of China, Hong Kong,
Republic of Korea and Singapore made increasing efforts
to diversify the markets for their traditional products and
the product composition of their overall exports. The ability
of most of these DMCs to sustain or even improve export
growth performance during 1980 attests to the success of
their efforts in this respect. :

Oil price increases during 1979-80 led to a sharp acceleration in oil payments by most DMCs. In some cases,
these payments reached very high proportions of total export earnings of DMCs (see above), despite conservation
measures adopted by them. The DMCs endeavored, often
successfully, to reduce further their energy consumption
growth based on imported oil during the year. The shortterm energy conservation measures adopted by them comprised mainly of adjusting upward the domestic prices of
petroleum and petroleum products, banning or restricting
the use of petroleum products for certain activities, and
restrictions on the use of automobiles.ELECTRICAL engineer rewinding @ motor at the Urea Fertilizer Project in Sri Lanka. This Bank-assisted Project is helping the

tional export crops.

In mast DMCs the energy sector received nigher priority
in the allocation of investment funds, The ‘ong-ierm energy
diversification plans adopied by some DMCs invoived conversion of cii-based Industries to coal and natural gas
(Republic of Korea and Philippines), accelerated estabiishment of large-scale and mini-hydropower plants and introduction of biogas plants (Burma, Sri Lanka and
Tnaiiand). Some countries also decided to establish or expand nuclsarbased power plants (Republic of Korea asc
Philippines}. Some countries (Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka
and Wesiern Samoa) were concerned about the depietion
of fuei resources from firewood and adopted remedial action programs. The three DMCs which are net exporters of
oi: (Burma, Indonesia and Malaysia} stepped up their
energy conservation efforts and diversification of sources
of energy suoply. They also intensified their search tor new
deposits of energy resources. However, many DMCs were
unabie to adjust quickly and fu'ly their domestic prices of
petroleum-based products to rising wore crude oil prices,
due to their impact on overall prices ana the socio-political
sensitivity of such measures. Tne upward acjustment of

vestment included tax incentives to exporters and export
industries (Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand), tax incentives for investment in export processing zones or free trade zones
(Repubsic of China, Pakistan and Sri Lanka), tax incentives
for trading companies (Singapore and Thailand) and subsidies on production of exportable commodities (Malaysia).
A number of DMCs also further liberalized their imports. In
addition to entering into bilateral trade agreements with
some of their trading partners, Philippines and Thailand
reduced tariffs on a number of manufactured products to
help improve the efficiency of domestic production.
Singapore reduced tariffs on a number of import items to
make domestic industries more competitive with exports of
other countries. Import liberalization in Bangiadesh, Indonesia and Pakistan was selectlve and specific to raw
materials, intermediate goods and capital machinery.

However, recession in the industrialized countries,
restrictions on trade in manufactures, the low international
prices of certain major export commodities (copra, copper,
bananas, timber, tea and jute) and the mounting cost of imports in relation to exports frustrated DMCs’ efforts to
balance their external trade accounts. The trade deficits of
mosi non-oil OMGs, as noted earlier, became much larger
and entailed greater financing problems. Although the net
inflow of development assistance from official sources is
likely to have been somewhat higher ihan in*1979, it
covered only part of the deficits of DMCs. Consequently,
DMCs had to continue their reliance on private capital
markets. The international banking community showed its
confidence in the growth potential of this region by further
lending to traditional borrowers and also by lending for the
first time to some new borrowers. The major borrowers
among DMGs, as in the past, were Indonesia, Republic of
Korea, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand, During the year,
india negotiated the largest single commercial credit
among OMCs at favorable terms and it also changed its
policy with respect to equity participation by foreign interests in local industries mainly to attract petro-dollars.
For the first time, it allowed a domestic private company to
raise funds in the international capital market without
government guarantee. However, the aggregate volume of
commercial loans raised by DMCs during 1980 was considerably below that contracted by them during 1979.

Many countries made efforts to slow the rates of inflation by maintaining the money supply growth rates in 1980
below the rate of growth in nominal income. This is expected to have a favorable impact on the price situation of
BMGs in 1981, barring further major destabilizing influences emanating either from domestic agricultural production or international developments. Several DMCs also
adjusted the nominai interest rates on deposits upward to
encourage private savings. However, the acceleration in inflation rates generally frustrated such incentives by reducing the real rates of return on savings deposits to low or
even negative levels.

Several DMCs made determined, efforts to mobilize more
public savings for development by further raising government tevenues and cutting down on subsidies and low
priority expenditures. These included Bangladesh, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Data on aggregate savings and investments available up to 1979 for 12 DMCs (Table 9) show
that during 1979 the share of domestic savings in GDP
declined in six DMCs while in others the share rose from

that of the previous year. However, in a majority of reporting DMCs the rate of investment in 1979 was higher than
that in the preceding year. As a result, the dependence of
most of these DMCs on external assistance for financing
investments increased during 1979.

Social goals — such as improving literacy, public health,
housing and employment-generating activities for lowincome groups — were emphasized by DMGs in the allocation of development funds. However, changes in social and
demographic parameters are closely linked with overall
economic growth and advances in these areas take time
and become appreciable only after prolonged efforts. Some
of the specific programs instituted by DMCs to provide income and employment opportunities to the poor were foodfor-work programs involving excavation of canals
(Bangladesh and India), promotion of village industries
(India) and accelerated transmigration and human seitlement projects {Indonesia}. To cushion the impact of inflation, several DMCs, including Philippines, Papua New
Guinea: and Thailand, increased minimum wages of
workers in both urban and rural areas. A number of DMCs
made efforts to improve the living conditions of low-income
groups through the expansion of social services in health,
education and housing, particularly in rural areas.

Measures to reduce population growth rates were actively pursued by a number of DMCs, Including those which
have already achieved considerable success, DMCs which
actively promoted family planning during the year included
Bangladesh, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Republic of
Korea, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Sri Lanka
and Thailand. Bangladesh, in pursuit of its goal of reducing
fertility to the replacement evel by 1985, adopted measures
aimed at strengthening those components of its national
population program which are crucial to generating a
favorable attitude to family planning and the small family
horm. Through a group of projects funded by the United Nations Fund for Population Activities and other international!
donors, Bangladesh significantly expanded facilities for
education and communication in family planning. In India,
orientation camps for influential village leaders were
organized for the purpose of discussing freely the various
aspects of family welfare as a strategy for revitalizing the
country’s population planning program. In Indonesia and
Sri Lanka, coordination of family planning with rural
development efforts, such as combining instructions in
family planning with training in productive skills, led to an
increase in the number of contraceptive acceptors.

Regional Cooperation

Efforts to promote regional cooperation among DMCs
made some progress during 1980. Economic Ministers of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
decided at their two meetings held in 1980 to intensify efforts for promoting intra-ASEAN trade by doubling the
number of items covered under preferential trading artangements to over 5,800 and instituting deeper tariff cuts
on those items, Progress on the first ASEAN industrial project in Indonesia was stalled because of higher than expected costs and difficulties in the finalization of financing
arrangemenis. However, in December, with Japan agreeing
to increase its concessional assistance, the award of the
construction contract was finalized and plant completion is
scheduled for early 1984. Limited progress was made inresoec: of tne ASEAN pro.ecis in Ma:aysia anc Thailand

Ai the Eleventh Soutn Pacific Forum Meeting in July,
severai DMCs, inc!uding Coox !siancs, Kiribati, Solornon
Islands. Tonga anc Western Sarnoa, signed tre South
Pacific Regional Trace and Economic Cooperation Agreement which provides South Pacific countries with imoraved
access to New Zeaianc and Australian markets. Papua
New Guinea was unable to sign but affirmed its support for
tne agreement. Fiji cecided not to sign because of its concern apout citrus juice and timber expors.

The issue of establisning a Pacitic Regional Advisory
Service was discussec at the Commonwealth Heads of
Government Regiona: Meeting (CHOGRM) in New Delhi in
September and it was decided ai the South Pacific Conference that the South Pacific Commission should
associaie itself with the initiative. This proposai had been
recommended at a Conference on Pacitic Island Development heid in Hawaii earlier in the year.

The New Deihi session of tre CHOGRM ciosed with a
communique stating tha: the mounting payments devicits
of developing countries are among the most urgent and
critica’ probiems facing the worle community. The leaders
calied for recycling surplus funds, iow-interest loans for
energy deveiopment in non-oil developing couniries anc
liberai traGe policies by developed countries to encourage
exports from developing countries. They agreec to forma
consuliative group to examine restrictions on trade and its
future iideralization.

  

  

Among significant bilaterai cooperation agreements
sianed by DMCs in 1980, the following may be noted:
Ma‘aysia and Thailand set up an eiectricity-sharing arrangement under which the completion of a cable connection between a power station in Perlis State, Malaysia and
Sadao, Thailans will supply power to Southern Thailane for
ts peak hour requirements anc wili provide Malaysia with
off-peak suaply for industria! and emergency uses. in connection with joint agricultural development projects in the
Golek River Basin, both countries agreed to appoint a third
country io undertake appropriate feasibility studies. The
Republic of Karea concluded bilate-al fisning agreements
witn severai South Pacific DMCs.

 

International Cooperation

The net infiow of external resources to DMCs rose ‘rom,

$70.3 ditiion in 1978 to $11.5 billion in 1979, the tatest year
for which complete cata are availabie.’ Biiaterai and
multilatera: official flows, inciuding OPEC assistance. increased from $7.7. bil:ion in 1978 to $8.6 billion in 1979 while
net private flows rose from $2.6 bition to $2.8 billion {Tabie

deficit incurred during the year, suggests that total net
flows to DMCs increased during 1980.

In March 1980, a new Food Aid Convention was concluded in London by a Conference of the Food Aid Committee
of the United Nations. In view of the growing food deficits
of many developing countries — particularly in Africa and
Asla’— and thelr large requirements for food assistance,
the Convention provided for an annual minimum volume of
food aid amounting to 7.6 million tons, an increase of 3.4
million tons over the previous level.

In view of the larger resource needs of developing countries, several measures were undertaken both to increase
the financial capacity of existing institutions and programs
and to introduce new facilities which would respond to
specific needs such as structural adjustment loans and
energy-related capital invesiments. Despite these initiatives, the record of accomplishments was mixed.

The quota increase under the Seventh General Review of
the IMF became effective in December when members
representing 75 per cent of total quotas accepted the proposed increase. This enhanced the capital resources of the
IMF by 50 per cent to about $78 billion, The Executive Board
of the IMF also reached a decision to allow its members to
avail themselves of resources in larger amounts and tor
longer periods. According to a new guideline, cumulative
use of facilities (excluding compensatory and buffer stock
facilities) by a member would be allowed to reach 600 per
cent of its quota as against the previous limit of 480 per
cent. This new celling on nei use of IMF facilities is to be
reached during a period of more than three years. However,
it ls expected that this guideline will be applied flexibiy
depending on a country’s particular circumstances.
Moreover a decision was reached to explore the possibility
of the IMF borrowing funds from governments or from the
private capital markets in order to enhance resources
available to the IMF. This approach emerged as an alternative to the IMF borrowing from oil exporting members.

While members of the World Bank are proceeding to
make effective the $40 billion capital increase agreed to in
1978, a further review of resources was commissioned in
view of several more recent developments including the
higher-than-projected rate of inflation, the admission to
membership of the People’s Republic of China in May, the
structural adjustment lending program of the World Bank
begun in 1980 and energy sector lending requirements set
at $25 billion for 1981-85.

In May 1980, the OPEC Finance Ministers agreed to
transform the OPEC Special Fund into a permanent
development agency with capital resources of $4 billion,
viz. the OPEC Fund for International Development. Further
progress in this regard was stalled due to recent events in
the Middle East involving two OPEC members.

After four years of negotiations, UNCTAD members
reached agreement on the establishment of the Common
Fund to be financed by contributions which are partly compulsory and partly voluntary. The Common Fund would provide assistance for various commodities through its two
windows; the first for buffer stocking and the second for
other measures such as research and development. The
agreement will become operational after it has been signed
by 90 countries accounting for a minimum of two-thirds of
the required contribution. A second condition for ratification which involved a minimum of $140 million in contributions to the second window has already been met. The

subscribed capital of $750 million will be supplemented by
individual commodity agreements which may cnoose to
join the Fund by depositing one-third of their maximum
stocking requirements with the Fund. The Common Fund is
open to all UN members.

A review of the first 10 years of the generalized nonreciprocal and non-discriminalory syslem of preferences
{GSP} was conducted during the year by UNCTAD's Special

Committee on Preferences. In addition to reiterating the importance of the GSP, the Committee concluded that the
system should be extended beyond the initial period of 40
years and that a comprehensive review of the system be
undertaken in 1890. Industrialized countries agreed to improve their various individual schemes by increasing the
umber of products covered and by improvemenis in
preferential rates. So far the European Economic Community (EEC) has agreed to extend its program fora 10-year
period,

In 1980, a start was made on implementing the Tokyo
Round Agreements. As existing tariff rates are generally
low, further tariff reductions are not by themselves expected to have a significant impact on trade. Instead, nontarlff barriers are regarded as the major current deterrents
to trade expansion. These include labelling and packaging
requirements, quality standards and health and sanitary
regulations which developing countries often find difficult
to meet because of lack of information regarding the requirements or technical limitations on production. In this
regard, developing countries will benefit from the agreement under the Tokyo Round to make available such infor-DREDGING Belawan port in northeastern Sumatra. The Bank is assisting the expansion of facilities at Indonesia's third major
port in order to heip meet rapidly growing cargo traffic. ‘

The report of the Independent Commission on International Developmen: Issues (Brandt Commission). prepared
over a two-year period, was submitted to the UN SecretaryGeneral in February. Covering tne broad spectrum of NorthSouth deveiooment issues, the report made several recommendations concerning reform of existing development tnStitutions and propesals for new initiatives including the
creation of a Worle Develooment Fund to supplement existing institutions, a system of automatic resource
transfers, and the holding of a summit meeting of develoning and industriaiized countries. Arhough the Brandt Commission recommendations were widely disseminated and
discussed over the past year, there was tittle progress on
agreements regarding its specific propesats. tn a meeting
of Foreign Ministers from selected industrialized and
developing countries neld ir Vienna, agreement was reachec to ciscuss the main proposais in a high level NorthSouth Summit to be helc i1 Mexico during 198%.

The UNIDO Ill Conference in New Dethi endec without
sudstartiai agreement om any of the principai agenda

items, frustrating the efforts to advance the North-South
dialogue. Further discussion was deferred to the Special
Session of the UN which was to consider strategy for the
Third United Nations Development Decade. At the Special
Session held in Augusi-September 1980, a consensus was
reached on the international deveionmen: strategy for the
Third Deveioomen: Decade to be submitted for approval at
the 35th regular session of the UN Generai Assembly.
However, the launcning of global negotiations — a task
assigned io the Speciai Session oy a 1979 General
Assembly resolution — was not achieved, with the result
that another Special Session has been scheduied for 1981.

The DMCs commenced the decade of the 1980s in a very
difficult international economic setting. As in the past, they
demonstrated considerable resilience in facing tne
economic chatienges that confronted them. In response to
the changing objectives ang priorities of its DMCs. the
Bank also continued to adjust its operational policies and
expand its activities. A brief account of the poticy initiatives and activities of the Bank during 1980 is proviced in
the following chaoters

 

19OPERATIONS AND POLICIES

Lending Operations

DURING 1980, overall Bank ending increased by 15 per
cent compared with a rise of 8 per cent in 1979. Tota! ioan
aporova's during the year amounted tc $1,436 million compared with $*,252 million in the previous year. The share o}
concessional ioans to the poorer and iess ceveiooed
member countries was about 33 der cent af total lending
during the year, higher than the average of 30 per cent over
the period 1967-80. Once again, co-financing and cooperation with other aid agencies and financia! institutions
substantially added to the Banx's own assistance to }
developing member countries (DMCs). Technicai
assistance activities increased by 5.6 per cent over 1979.

During the year, a tota‘ of 59 ioans — including two program ioans, two sector ioans and one multioroject loan —
for 58 projects in 17 DMCs were approved, compared with
58 loans for 54 projects! in 18 DMCs in 1979.

Loans from ordinary capital resources {OCR} in 1980
amounted to $956.5 million, an increase of 14.8 per cent
over the corresponding figure of $835 million in 1979, while
loans from Special Funds (SF), amounting to $477 million,
showed almost the same percentage increase over the 1979
concessional lending figure of $416 miilion. In 1980, 88 per
ceni of SF loans went to DMCs which had a per capita GNP
of less than $300 in 1979.

The average size of loans rose from $21.6 million in 1979
to $24.3 miilion in 1980, The average size of OCR ioans increased from $28.8 million in 1979 to $33 million in 1980,
whiie the average size of SF loans increased from $14.4
million io $15.9 milion over the Same period. While this
trend is parily attributabie to higher project costs arising
from worldwide infiation, there was also a conscious effort
on the part of the Bank to increase the average size of
loans, where necessary, in order io curb administrative
overheads and acceierate tne transfer of resources to
DMCs.

During the year, five DMCs receivec loans exciusively
from OCR: Hong Kong ($20 million}, Indonesia ($284.6
million), Republic cf Korea ($174.5 million), Malaysia ($83.7
million} and Singapore {$19 million}.

COAL, the only major domestic energy resource in the Republic of
Korea, plays an important role in the country’s economic development. Bank assistance to the Coal Development Project has pro
vided mining and safety equipment at Dai Han Coal Corporation's
eight mines.

Four DMCs received loans from both OCR and SF:
Pakistan, $178.3 million ($56.3 million from OCR and $122
million from SF}; Papua New Guinea, $20 million ($12
million from OCR and $8 miilion from SF); Philippines,
$178.3 million ($158.3 million from OCR and $20 million
from SF); and Thailand, $170 million ($150 million from OCR
and $20 million from SF).

Eignt DMCs received loans exclusively from SF;
Bangiadesh ($150.9 million}, Burma ($50.5 million), Cook
Islands ($1 million), Lao People’s Democratic Republic
($10.1 million), Nepal ($38.5 million), Solomon Islands ($3.6
million}, Sri Lanka ($47.8 million) and Western Samoa ($4.7
million).

Despite variations in sectoral emphasis applicable to inGividual DMCs, there was a general consensus on the importance of agriculture and rural development. This sector
was given increased attention, especialiy in the low-income
DMGs ana in the iess developed areas of the middle-income
DNCs, in an effort to help raise income and emoloyment
levels in the rural areas. The second major sectoral focus
was on development of the Energy sector, particularly on
the increased utilization of indigenous energy resources.
The third sector that ciaimed substantial Bank assistance
was the development of sociai infrastructure such as
potable water, housing and urban development, health care
and population and education.

Bank activities in 1980 generally followed this broad sectoral strategy, with 32.6 per cent of total lending for the year
going te the Agricu'ture and Agro-industry sector. Lending
in this sector covered such activities as tubewell and irrigation development, agricuitura! credit, palm oil processing,
integrated agricultural and rural deveiopment, rubber
development and forestry, fisheries and livestock development. The Energy sector received 26.6 per cent of total lending during 1980, mainiy for the deveiopment of indigenous
energy resources such as hyGropower, natural gas and
lignite, the improvement of loac despatch capacity and
rurai electrification. Lending for social infrastructure constituted 15.9 per cent of total lending for the year for the
development of sociai facilities such as pubic health,
small. towns water supply, sewerage. vocational education
and training, and urban housing; 15.6 per cent went to the
Transport and Communications sector and the remaining

9.3 per cent to Industry and Non-Fuel Minerals and Development Banks.

The total cost of projects approved in 1980, excluding six
development finance institution (DF}} projects, two sector
loans and two program loans, is estimated at $3,561
million. Direct Bank financing of ithe total project costs
amounted to about 33.4 per cent. On the basis of the Bank’s
past experience, it is estimated that the total cosi of the
subloan projects to be financed by the six DFI loans will be
about $530 million. The projects and programs to be financed by the sector and program loans wit! involve an
estimated total investment cost of $192 million.

At the end of 1980, the Bank’s cumulative lending had
reached $8,093 million for 455 projects in 24 DMCs. Of this
total, loans amounting to $5,653 million were from OCR and
$2,440 million were from SF.

Although financing the foreign exchange costs of goods
and services required for these projects will continue to be
the main form of Bank assistance to DMCs, it has been
recognized that other modes of assistance are required to
make the Bank's developmental role in these countries
more effective and broader based.

For instance, program lending, which was introduced in
1978, is designed primarily to help DMCs increase production where there is underutilization of existing capacity,
and to provide a relatively flexible means through which
OMCs can achieve optimum capacity utilization. In 1980,
the Bank approved two program loans: $15.6 million for a
Public Health Program in Bangladesh and $5 million for a
Petroleum Refining Industry Program in Burma. To date, six
program loans have been approved by the Bank, amounting
to $60.5 million.Secio: iending was introduced in 1980. This form of lending has several potentia: advantages, both trom the
Bank's point of view as wel! as tnat of the DMCs
themse:ves. These inciude larger loan size, greater
institution-builoing impact and quicker disbursements.
This form of lending is exaected to be particularly use
sectors where a number of individuaily small investment
activities can be combined uncer one loan. in 1980, the
Bank approved two sector foars: $32 mitiion ‘or tne Water
Suppiy sector in Indonesia and $65 mitiion for tne Highway
sector in Thai‘and.

in recent years, ihe Bank has gained considerabie experience in providing foreign exchange fo: lacai cost financing (LCF) to DMCs atigitie for this type 0! financing on the
basis o* sucn factors as their overal! baiance of payments
position and ability to mobilize domestic resources, as well
as the necessity of orojects in sectors where the locai cost
component of projects is high, such as agriculture and
social infrastructure. Such financing increased from $5.9
million in 1974, the jirst year in which LCF was introduced
by the Bank, to $81.5 7 in 1979. In 1980, the amount of
LCF was $105 million spread over 15 loans to eight DMCs.
Of this, $33 miilion was from OCR and $72 million from SF,
accouniing for 3 per cent and +5 per cent, respectively. of
OCR and SF loans approved during the year. Ai the end of

The Bank has also financed interest and other charges
during construction uncer special circumstances such as
the need to relieve the financiai strain on executing agencies during the construction period of projects, and also io
ease the oeb: service burcen on DMCs before projects start
yielding benefits. ix 1980, the Bank financed interest and
other charges during corstruction amounting to $19.7
million from OCR for four projects.

The Bank's operations in the small islanc deveioping
countries, mainly in the South Pacific, received special attention. The relatively small size of individual projects has
been one of the problems faced by the Bank in its activities
in these countries. To overcome this, the Bank decided to
introduce a new category of muitiproject loans for these
countries and the first such loan was made to Tonga in
1979. 1n 1986, another multiproject joan, for $1 million, was
made tc Cook Islands. This loan is expected to cover the
financing of six subprojects with individual estimated total
costs ranging from $81,906 to $299,000.

In view of the range and diversity of economic develosment and performance of its DMCs, the Bank has recognized some broad country categories, Dased on an assessment of each country’s per capita GNP ievei, balance of
payments and debt repayment capacity (see pages 56 and
57). These categories are used as a broad guide to determine access to concessional assistance and broadly
reflect the relative levels of economic development among
the Bank’s low, middle and high-income DMCs. At present,
the Bank’s lending policy gives the low-income countries
full access to SF; the middie-income DMCs borrow mainly
from OCR, out have access to SF for modest amounts subject to the avaitability of resources, while the higher-income
countries have access only to OCR. The Bank aiso conducts a periodic review of each DMC's economic situation,
focusing on overali and sectoral periormance as well as
assessing what impact current development may have on
future growth prospects. These reviews, together with
regular on-going dialogues with DMCs, allow the Bank to
formulate on a country-by-country basis a program of
assistance designed to help the DMCs overcome their
specific development constraints.

Co-Financing

In addition to its own lending operations, the Bank has
been active in encouraging co-financing with other sources
for Bank-assisted ‘projects. The main objective of cofinancing is to help mobilize a larger infiow of external
resources to mest the development needs of the DMCs. Cofinancing enables the Bank to diversify its operations
among borrowing DMCs and among priority projects, and
facilitates financing of large-scale projects, the financing
requirements of which may not be fully met by the Bank
itself. Through co-financing, the Bank is abie to play a more
effective catalytic role in promoting investment and
deveiopment in the region.

During the year, 22 Bank-financed projects involved cofinancing, with funds contributed by co-financiers amounting to $391 miilion and those by the Bank to $600 million."

which co-financiers contributed $431 milion, and the Bank
$723 milion. The amount of co-financing in 1980 was affected by carrying over some large projects requiring cojinancing from the 7980 pipeline to 198+.

As in the past, the bulk of the Bank's co-financing in 1980
was with official sources, both bilatera! and muitilateral,
which together contributed $343 million or 88 per cent of
total co-financing in the year. Multilateral sources. such as
the World Bank Group, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), World Health Organization (WHO), Inter
nationa! Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), European Economic Community (EEC) and OPEC Fund for internationat Development, contributed $295 mi
bilaterai sources, comprising Austraiia, Feder.
of Germany. Japan, New Zealand and Switzeriand, contributed $48 million.

During the year, the Bank reached ar. ungerstanding with
the Worid Bank Group on co-financing development projects in certain South Pacific countries which are common
members of both institutions, and entered into cooperation
arrangements with the Government of Switzerland on financing Gevelopment projects and technica! assistance in the
Bank's DMCs (see pages 59 and 61).

Co-financing of $16.3 miiion was arranged in 1980 with
commercial banks for two power projects in Republic of

  
 

Korea anc Thailand. A feature of the co-financing arrangement in the Republic of Korea was the incorporation of an
optional “'cross-default” clause in the Bank's loan agreement with the borrower, under which the Bank has the option to declare its own loan in default should the borrower
be in default under the commerciai bank joan, and vice versa. In addition, co-financing of $31.6 million was arranged
with export credit sources from Canada ano Japan for a
power project in Thailand.

The largest share of the Bank's co-financing in 1980 was
in the Energy sector, for which co-financiers contributed
$263 million or 67 per cent of tota: Bank co-financing. Other
sectars involving co-financing were Water Supply and
Sewerage ($63 million), Agriculture and Agro-Industry ($58
miliion), and Transport and Communications, Development
Banks, Education and Health accounting for smaller
amounts.

in addiction to co-financing, four projects amounting to
$62 million were processec by the Bank in 1980 for exciusive financing by other sources. Three of these projects,
amounting to $49 militon, were for IFAD financing, anc one
project, for $43 million, was for financing by EEC anc the
Government of Switzerlanc. External resources mobilized

amounted to $452 mi

 

 

27Benefits to the Poor

The Bank has been devoting increased attention in its
project activities to the alleviation of poverty in its DMCs. A
brief, outline of the Bank's approach in combatting this
acute and widespread problem was presented in last year’s
Annual Report.

During 1980, this strategy was further strengthened: 90
per cent of the total concessional lending of $477 million
was committed to the low-income DMCs compared with 85
per cent in 1979, and in the few instances where modest
amounts of ADF funds were provided to lower middleincome DMCs the Bank ensured thal a high proportion of
project benefits would accrue to the poorer segments of
the population. During the year, Bangladesh ($150.8 million)
received the largest amount of ADF funds, followed by
Pakistan ($122 miilion}, Burma ($50.5 million), Sri Lanka
{$47.8 million) and Nepal ($38.5 million).

Local cost financing (LCF) is also an important vehicle
for strengthening the impact of Bank-assisted projects on
ihe poor. In many DMCs, per capita income levels are so
low that domestic savings are inadequate to cover local
currency costs of development projects, despite the
availability of firlancing for foreign exchange project componenis. In 1980, the Bank provided $72 million from ADF
resources for LCF, which represented 15 per cent of total
ADF lending for the year. Qut of $105 million in local costs
financed by the Bank during the year, nearly 69 per cent
was provided through ADF loans, and over 93 per cent of
the LCF in concessional toans was directed to the rural
areas of the poorest DMCs. Of the eight DMCs which
received LCF in +980, five were among the low-income
DMCs. These countries received $67.34 million, or 64 per
cent, of the total LCF provided in 1880. The share of LCF to
iotal lending that each received was as follows: Nepal (28.8

 

per cent), Sri Lanka (20.9 per cent), Bangladesh (18.3 per
cent), Cook Islands (14 per cent) and Pakistan (10.7 per
cent).

Ai the sectoral programming level, the Bank recognizes
that development of all economic sectors leads to benefits
to the poor by increasing their income-earning capacity,
either through greater national production or extension and
redisiribution of public services. Nevertheless, it is equally
recognized that certain sectors are particularly important
for providing the basic goods and services needed to improve the quality of life. Those sectors and areas of activity
which cover basic human needs — namely, agriculture,
education, health {including sanitation) and water supply
— ase quicker and more effective in efforts to alleviate
poverty.

In 1980, the Bank approved 33 loans, amounting to
$695.65 million, to these sectors, compared with $653.08
million in 1979.

Agriculture and rural development is considered particularly important if the Bank's efforts to reach the poor
are to succeed, since the vast majority of the poor in the
Bank's DMCs live in rural — and often remote — areas. During the year, Bank lending to this sector amounted to
$467.9 million, with 57.7 per cent of the funds being in the
form of concessional loans.

tn the Education secios, the Bank doubled its lending in
4980 for technical and vocational training. Many of the
trained workers will directly serve the poor as teachers,
health specialists, and agricultural extension workers.
Three projects amounting to $85 million will help turn out
about 12,000 trained workers, teachers, and craftsmen.

Increased attention has also been directed by the Bank
to the health and essential needs of the urban poor, in the
form of potable water supply, basic housing, public health
and other social services. Two sewerage projects, two urban development projects and two urban water supply projects, amounting to $144.35 million, were approved in +980
These projects will help combat contagious diseases which
spread quickly in areas without safe water supplies and
basic hygiene practices.

During the year, the Bank also approved a $32 million
sector joan — the Bank's first — for the Small Towns Water
Supply Sector in Indonesia, This Project will help establish
water supply facilities, in many instances for the first time,
in about 33 small towns in rural areas, and provide potable
water to about 720,000 people, half of whom are in the
lower-income sections of their communities.

Bank operations in other sectors during 1980 will also
bring significant benefits to the poorer segments of the
population. The Vientiane Plain Rural Electrification Project in Lac People’s Democratic Republic, for example, will
extend the benefits of the Nam Ngum Hydropower Project
— in which the Bank was also involved — by providing electrification for 76 villages. Similarly, the poor will de the principal beneficiaries of the Second Road !mprovement Project in the Philippines (which the Bank supported with a $30
million toan); the Mahaweli Area Roads Development Project in Sri Lanka ($10 million) and the Highway Sector Project in Thailane ($65 million).

Improved access to credit facilities at appropriate rates
is also vital for people who are engaged in small and
medium-scale entrepreneurial activities. Many of the
Bank's loans to development banks in the region, which in
1980 amounted to $127 million, are thus designed for on
 

:lending to small and medium-scaie enterprises and to encourage maximum employment? creation.

In the finai analysis, nowever, the linkages at the project
tevei are crucial for ensuring that the poor benefit from the
Bank's projects. The ultimate impact on ihe door of Bankfinanced projects wi!l be affected by decisions taken at all
stages in their iife-cycle — from the selection of the particular orojects to be financeo to project design and implementation, in order to ensure that the coor benefit in
direct anc tangible ways at the project level, the Bank in
1980 introduced guidelines wnich will contribute to
systematic project appraisal and subsequent Project
Benefit Monitoring end Evaluation. These new guidelines,
which at this stage will De followed on an experimental
basis for agriculture ance rural development projects. are
designed to integrate Project Benefit Monitoring and
Evaluation with the Logical Framework Pianning of projects so that tne iessons to be learned from eariier efforts
— faiiures as well as successes — can be systematically
tec inte new pro:ects in an effort to benefit the poor.

During +986, 33 ioans — representing over 64 per cent of
all ADF iending and 41 per cen? of OCR lending during ihe
year — were specificaily oriented towards denefizting the
poor, particularly in meeting basic human needs. The
degree of benefit is expected te vary from projec? to project, Dut the following highiighis indicate some of tne
benetits anticipated in six different areas of activity:

  
 

@ Irrigation: Eight irrigation projects were approved by
the Bank in 1980. The Cibaliung and Lower Citanauy Projects in Indonesia will provide direct benefits to about

70,800 rural famiiies in tne form of increased earnings from
improved agricultura: productivity. In aadition, the environmental impact of various oroject components, such as
flood control facilities, road networks, soil conservation
and erosion control, and vii:age water supply, wil! positively
improve tne living standards of the rurai population as well
as generally contribute to the country's program for jood
self-sufficiency. Other projects ir tield which were approved in 1980 were Northern Sumatra Irrigation Study in
indonesia, Secone Laguna de Say irrigation Project in the
Philippines. Kemasin Rural Develooment Project in
Malaysia, Tubewell Development Project in Bangladesh,
Hul Irrigation (Western Region) Project in Nepal anc OnFarm Water Management Project in Paxistan. In addition,
three irrigation-oriented agricultural development projects,
including Second Agricultural Crediz Project in
Bangiadesh, Agricultural Support Facilities Project in Lao
Peopie’s Democratic Republic ana Negeri Sembilan Timur
integrated Agricultural Development Project in Maiaysia,
were aporoved

 

 

® Dry Zone Agriculture: This Project in Sri Lanka ts expected to benefit about 23,100 farm families directiy, and a
further 20,100 rural families — many of whom iive on bare
subsistence — indirectly. The Project has wide-ranging
potential in that, based on the experience with this form of
agricuitura. technoiogy, it can serve as a modei for other
dry zone areas of the country.

@ Fisheries: Four fisheries projects, in Burma, indonesia, Nepal and Pakistan, were approved in 1980 which
together wii: create adgitiona: employment opportunities
for 40,000 low-income workers as well as increase the fish
catch by almost 320,000 m.t. for the benefit of over 14
million consumers.

@ Education: Technical and vocational training will de
provided in three projects approved in 1980, one each in Inoonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Under these projects, a
toial of aimost 12,000 sxilled workers, craftsmen and
technical teachers will annually enter the labor force from
these training institutions,

@ Health: in reiativeiy higher-income countries, the Bank
is apie to reach the poor through judicious project selec-tion. The Sewage Treatment Project in the Republic of
Korea and the Manila Sewerage Project In the Phitippines
are examples of this. In the Republic of Korea, about
485,000 people will benefit from improved sewage treatment. The Manila Sewerage Project will rehabilitate and extend the city’s sewerage system to benefit directly about
800,000 people and at the same time improve sanitation
facilities for about 2.4 million of the city’s population. The
majority of the beneficiaries will be urban poor, of whom
about two million live in more than 400 blighted areas scattered throughout the city. jn Bangladesh, the Bank will provide $15.6 million in the form of a program loan to increase
the supply of essential drugs for the primary health care
program of the country. The drugs will help combat various
diseases — particularly malaria — and about 20 million
people living in the rural areas are expected to benefit.

@ Housing: The Bang Plee New Town in Thailand is an
example of a concentrated effort by the Bank to help poor
areas in relatively higher-income societies. This Project
takes an integrated approach to the provision of public
housing and associated services for low-income
households currently living in substandard accommodation in urban areas. Over 30,000 people are expected to
benefit directly.

Although the Bank will further intensify its efforts to help
the poor, its activities can only be seen as modest when
viewed against the enormity of the problem of poverty in
the region, Concentrated thrusts in key sectors can
nonetheless do much to assist in improving some of the

basic conditions affecting the quality of life of the poor.
Progress in the DMCs has been achieved in the past two
decades, for example, in raising life expectancy averages,
in reducing infant mortality rates and in. raising literacy
levets. The long-term solution, however, must remain the
necessity to generate overall productive economic growth,
and, in this regard, the Bank can play an important supportive role in the development efforts of the’ DMCs
themselves.

Sectoral Review

Agriculture and Agro-Industry

Growth in the agriculture sector continues to be the main
determinant of overall growth in the majority of the Bank’s
DMCs. Food imports have to be contained in order to
reduce external payments deficits, and the ragion as a
whole has little option but to seek greater self-reliance
through a sustained long-term increase in agricultural production.

Agriculture contributes between 30 and 70 per cent of
Gross National Product, and the proportion of the national
labor force employed in agriculture ranges between 50 and
90 per cent in the majority of the Bank's DMCs. Over onethird of the value of exports of these countries is accounted
for by agricultural commodities — including those in processed form — and in many the share !s over one-half.

The Bank has consistently accorded high priority to the
agriculture sector (which covers Irrigation and rural
development, fisheries, livestock, agricultural credit and
support services, forestry, fertilizer and agro-processing) in
its lending and technical assistance activities and its
future strategy Is geared to meeting some of the major problems facing rural Asia In the coming decade. These include widespread underemployment and unemployment
and poverty among rural populatlons; the unsatisfactory
performance of agricultural production and distribution
systems; inadequate implementation capacities at both
government and grassroots levels; and continuing neglect
of certain vital eco-systems.

The Bank’s efforts are mainly aimed at increasing food
production and the productivity of food and other agricuitural crops through improvements in irrigation and other productive infrastructure, the supply of agro-inputs, and access to markets and storage facilities.

During 1980, the Bank continued to increase the range
and volume of its lending and technical assistance to this
vital sector. It also took specific measures to sharpen the
focus and the effectiveness of its developmental activities
by adopting new policy recommendations for Bank Operations in the Agriculture Sector in the South Pacific, and
preparing and distributing Guidelines on Logical
Framework Pianning and Project Benefit Monitoring and
Evaluation {see page 29).

During the year, Bank lending to this sector amounted to
$467.9 milllon for 22 projects, compared with $411.6 million
for 21 projects in 1979. Technical assistance amounted to
$9.8 million for 30 projects, compared with $7.7 million for
30 projects in 1979.

in terms of overall Bank lending, the Agriculture and
Agro-Industry sector received approximately one-third (32.6
per cent) of total loans during 1980, compared with 32.9 per
cent in 1979. This sector also received 69.2 per cent of theBank’s tecnnical assistance, compared with 55.4 per cent

in 1979.

In addition to the 22 loans approved for Bank financing in
this sector during the year, the Bank processed three loans
for exclusive financing by the Internaiionat Fund for Agricultural Development (iFAD). The Bank aiso appraised the
Oil Paim Deveiopmen: Project in Burma, which will be
financed by the Government of Switzeriand and the EEC.

Toial lending to this sector as of the end of 1980
amountec to. $2,264.4 million for 152 projects, while
technica! assistance amounted to $41.6 miliion for 188 projects.

irrigation and Rural Development: The Bank recognizes
that irrigation is a critical tactor in raising regiona! food
production as in most DMCs there appears to be little
scope for expanding the areas under cultivation. In rural
development, ihe Bank emphasizes an integrated approach
and pays special attention to strengthening rural institutions and to ensuring increased participation of small-scale
farmers and landless workers in Bank-assistec projects.

During 1980, the Bank approved loans and technical
assistance for severai projects containing unique or innovative features in the Irrigation and Rural Development
subsector. These inciuded:

* irrigation and a variety of rural development schemes

to be extended for the first time to the Hill Regions of

Nepal involving improvement: of village tracks, erosion

i, increase in fuei and fodder supply through

foothiil development and installation of a minihydropower plant (Hill Irrigation Project).
* Irrigation development by ihe rehabilitation of existing
as well as installation of new deep tubewells to allow
year-round cropping of about 44,000 ha. on irrigable Jand
in northern Bangtadesh including electric power supply
and command area development covering provision of
tertiary and on-farm water distribution networks and
water management extension (Tubewell Project).

* Watercourse reconstruction, complementary ground
water supply and improved ‘on-farm water management

to be provided on condition that legalized water-users'
associations are first established (On-Farm Water

Management Project in Pakistan).

* Agricultuyal production over a broad project area to be

increasec through irrigation, on-farm development,

replanting of old rubber areas, livestock and aquaculture

developmeni, various agricultural support services, a

program for increasing operating farm size and the con
struction and improvement of rural roads (Negeri Sembiian Timur Integrated Agricultural Development Project
in Malaysia).

* A comprensnsive staff training and development pro
gram — focusing on upgrading staff capanility of the

Government's Executing Agency in programming and im
plementing the country’s irrigation projects and on the

proper operation and maintenance of compieted irrigation facilities — to be included in an irrigation project

{Cibaliung Irrigation Project in Indonesia).

* Rehabilitation of ancient water storage tanks which

have faiien into disuse and disrepair (Anuradhapura Dry

Zone Agriculture Project in Sri Lanka).

During 1980, the Bank also extended post-construction
operation and maintenance assisiance to sirengihen the
institutional aspects of the on-going the Nong Wai Irrigation Management Project in Thailand through a technical
assistance grani of $360,000. This is designed to’ help
realize the fuil potential of the Nong Wai Pioneer
Agriculture Project, which was originally supported by the
Bank with a $5 million concessional loan in 1974. The
technical assistance alsc includes a Project Benefit
Monitoring and Evaluation component.

During the year, the Bank approved ioans which continued to encourage diversified cropping. The Second
Laguna de Bay Irrigation Project in the Philippines, for example, wili promote the cultivation of vegetables.

The Bank also continued its efforts to ensure that small
farmers in its DMCs benefit from its agricultural credit projects. The proceeds of a $28.1 million concessional loan for
the Secone Agricultura! Credit Project in Bangladesh, for
example, will be relent by Bangladesh Krishi Bank to inGividua! farmers, groups of small farmers and workshop
operaiors in three nortawestern districts of that country.
This Project will substantially increase cropping intensities, provide an opportunity for about 20,000 poor farm
families to maintain their land assets and raise their in-32

come levels. Il will generate about 41,000 additional jobs
annually.

In 1980, the Bank approved 11 loans amounting to
$283.45 million in the Irrigation and Rural Development
subsector, bringing the cumulative total to 81 ioans amounting to $1,261.4 million.

Fisheries: The Bank has three principal aims in its provision of financial and technical assistance to the Fisheries
subsector: lo increase the availability of fish and fish products for domestic consumption; lo increase fish exporls
andfor replace fish imporis in order to earn or save foreign
exchange: and to generate employment for and increase
{he incomes of fishermen, fish farmers and others in
related occupations.

The Asian and Pacific region contains substantial
fisheries resources with potential for expanded production,
both in the oceans and in inland water areas in which
fisheries and aquaculture can be developed. Moreover,
many DMCs have greally expanded fisheries resources
within their national jurisdictions by declaring 200 mile ex

marine (i.e. coastal and offshore) fisheries. aquaculture and
inland fisheries, and important infrastructure such as
fisheries ports, as well as landing, onshore and marketing
facilities. Attention is also increasingly being paid to
fisheries training and education

During 1980, the Bank made four foans amounting to
$75.8 million for the Fisheries subsector, including the Second Marine Fisheries Development Project in Pakistan, the
Inland Fisheries Development Project in Burma, a loan and
a technical assistance grant for the Aquacuhure Development Project in Nepal, and a loan and technical assistance
grant for the Sumatra Fisheries Development Project in Indonesia.

At the end of 1980, the Bank had made 26 loans amounling to $333.5 million for fisheries. 11 had also extended 21
technical assistance grants amounting to $3 million to this
subsector and an additional $742,000 for fisheries com:

Agro-Industry: The Bank's strategy in its lending to this
subsector is to replant and improve cultivation practices
relating to agro-Industrial crops, modernize the associated
processing Industries and provide facilities for marketing
in order to ralse productivity In both the public and
smallholder sectors. The Bank also pays close attention to
the development of marginal lands, the rehabilitation of old
estates and the provision of employment opportunities and
social Inputs in the projects it supports.

During the year, the Bank extended three loans amounting to $60.8 million to this subsector. These included: a
Rubber Rehabilitation and Expansion Project in
Bangladesh, the Third Tea Development Project in Sri
Lanka (in which a major component was improvements to
housing, medical facilities and schools for the labor force),
and the Palm Oil Processing and Smaliholder Development
Project in indonesia,

At the end of 1980, the Bank had provided a iotal of
$481.1 million in loans for 31 projects in the Agro-industry
subsector, and $3.4 million in technical assistance for 23
projects.

Forestry: The role of forestry in regional economic
development as a stabilizer of vital watersheds for sustained downstream agricultural production, as a supplier of
raw material for various wood-based industries and as a
promoter of environmental quality has been recognized by
the Bank. More recently, however, greater emphasis has
been placed on the implications of forestry for socio

economic development in view of the impact of forestry on
tural development and eco-systems.

The need for the Bank to expand operations in the
Foresiry subsector has become increasingly urgent in view
of the diminishing supply of traditional woodfuels in rural
Asia and widespread deforestation, and forestry programs
have mainly concentrated on the contribution of forests to
the welfare of poor rural communities.

During the year, the Bank provided technical assistance
for the development of forestry projects in Bangladesh,
Burma, Sri Lanka and Papua New Guinea. A Community
Forestry Project in Sri Lanka, for example, provided for a
feasibility study — to be undertaken by the FAO Investment Genter — for a 10,000 ha. fuelwood plantation and a
2,500 ha. pilot community self-help multipurpose village
plantation. The study wiil also review Sri Lanka's
Cooperative Reforestation Program as a basis for recommending a broad national community forestry strategy, and
analyze the country’s overall firewood requirements over
the next 20 years.

During the year, the Bank also approved a $1.74 million
concessional loan for a Forestry Development Project in
Western Samoa — to be co-financed with the New Zealand
Government — which will provide for exiensive reforestation and timber extraction, the construction of 52 km. of
roads, provision of a workshop and maintenance equipmeni, and overseas training for local staff.

At the end of 1980, the Bank had provided four joans
amounting to $39.7 million to the Forestry subsector, and
15 technical assistance grants amounting to $1.64 million.Energy

Recent steep increases in petroleum prices and the continuing uncertainty cf its worldwide supply have adversery
atfected many Asian economies, particularly as most
DMCs are dependeni or oil-derived energy for 75 per cent of
their commercial needs.

The énergy-importing DMCs’ baiance-of-sayments deficit
on current account — reflecting the rising bitl of petroieum
imports and the effects of inflation on the prices of industriat imports — increased from $4.2 billion in 1970 io
$18.6 billion in 1979, during which period the cost of
petroieum imparts in the total imgort bili of DMCs more
than doubied from 7.5 cer cent to over 15 per cent. The
shortfall was financed by subsiantial intiows of external
financing.

Moreover, the prospect of increasing scarcity continues
to exert upward pressure on petroleum prices. This, in turn,
piaces a greater burden on the non-oil exporting DMCs, as
seen in these figures: in 1973, imported petroieum costs of
DMCs amounted to about $2 bilfion, accounting for only 8
per cent of their total export earnings. In 1980, however,
this figure rose to $32.1 billion {23.4 per cent). and by 1990 it
is expected to increase to $83 billion (35 per cent).

The Bank and its DMCs nave long recognizes the key role
that energy plays in social and economic development. For
this reason, the Bank has given special support io the
priority accorded by the Asian region to the construction of
hydroeleciric power plants, gas pipelines, geothermal
power units, rural elecirification systems, and other projects directed at increasing the DMCs’ indigenous energy

 

supply and assisiing them to formulate policies and programs which are conaucive to efficient use and conserva:
tion of energy.

Traditionaity, eiectris power nas dominated Bank operations in the energy fie.d, accounting for over 90 per cent of
Energy sector iending. In 1976, the Bank decided to expand
its activities to include financing of coai mining projects. In
late 1979. the Banx decided that it should expand its activities in the fo:lowing areas:

« Increasing assistance for develooment of indigenous
sources of eiectric power, i.e. geothermal, coal, lignite,
natural gas, and hydroelec:ric (inciuding mini-hydro). in particular, the Bank wit consider financing rural mini-hydro

ment plans of OMCs — and of Bank lending activities —
with regard to their short and long-term impact on energy
availability and utilization.

Within this framework, the Bank will decide the weight it
should give to each of these activities in its lending and
technical assistance programs. In order to do this, the
Bank undertook a survey in the latter half of 1980 which
focused on such issues as the availability of and demand
for specific energy resources, the implications of increasing energy costs for economic growth, investment needs,
and institutional and policy matters (see page 50). With this
information, the Bank will now be able to determine intercountry and intra-couniry priorities in a systematic manner,
and plan its tending and technical assistance programs accordingly.

The relative weight that would be given to various forms
of lending and technical assistance in the Energy sector by
the Bank will be determined, in part, by the activities of
,other bilateral, multilateral and private organizations. In
this regard, the Bank's survey is designed to identify the
role that these other organizations could be expected to
play. Furthermore, this information will be of value in helping to determine an appropriate division of labor between
aid agencies and commercial enterprises, in order to obtain
the advantages of specialization and avoid duplication of

effort between them.

The Bank will heip its borrowing countries respond efficiently to changing circumstances in the Energy sector. institutional reform and manpower development — which are
essential complements to greater financial aid — will,
therefore, be increasingly recognized in Bank operations in
this sector.

{In 1980, the Bank approved nine loans for the Energy sector, five for energy utilization and four for energy-resource
development. In addition to undertaking the Regional
Energy Survey, it also approved four technical assistance
grants, one for a natural gas distribution project in
southeast Bangladesh and three for hydroelectric projects
in Lao People's Democratic Republic, Burma and Western
Samoa.

During the year, the Bank extended a $85 million joan to
Thailand — the single largest loan made by the Bank thus
far — for a Power System Expansion Project. The Bank's
credit will enable Thailand to develop its electric power
system efficiently and economically.

In line with its policy of meeting the requirements of the
low-income segments of the population, some of the
Bank's loans in the Energy sector are directed towards projects in relatively poor rural areas, where they directly
benefit a substantial proportion of the low-income popula-1980

Industry and Non-Fuel Minerals

industrial growth in many DMCs has been hampered in
recent years by several constraints, especially the continuous steep increases in imported fuel costs, but indusirialization remains a focal point in regional economic
deveiopment. industriaiization helps improve balance of
payments through impor? substitution and/or export diversification, and can provide higher empioyment, more
equitable income distribution and a wider ownership of the
means of production.

The Bank's fundamental strategy is to help DMCs

_ develop their basic inaustries by direct lending for large
scaie orojects and by indirect lending through DFls which
are involved in the promotion of small and medium-scale industries.

Higher imported iuel costs have also spurred many
DMCs to intensify the search for untapped mineral
resources which cculd help tnem save foreign exchange.
The «known mineral resources of the Asian and Pacific
region vary considerably from country to country, and the

    
   
   

  
    
      
     
 
   

37Bank follows a strategy of enhancing the capacity of its
DMCs to carry out geological surveys to seek out and prove
these resources, wlth a view to facilitating their systematic
explolitation.

Development of mineral resources for export and
domestic consumption could have a favorable impact on
the forelgn exchange earnings or savings of most DMCs, At
least flve DMCs — Burma, indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines
and Thalland — are known to have significant amounts of
untapped mineral resources. The implementation of
systematic geological, geophysical and geochemical
surveys could help facilitate a more rapid pace of mineral
fesources development in DMCs through generation of
rellable data on location, quantity, quality and mineability
of mineral ore deposits.

The Bank's first loan for mineral resources development
was approved in 1978 to help upgrade ihe institutional
structure and physical facilities of ihe Korea Institute of
Geosclence and Minerals (KIGAM) in order to Improve the
Republic of ‘Korea’s capabifity for carrying out mineral

and expansion of the Geological Survey of Bangladesh, the
national institution responsible for the collection and
dissemination of geological data and information relating
to the country and its continental shelf.

During the year, the Bank also extended six technical
assistance grants, amounting to $939,000, for mineral
resources development: $178,000 for Tin Mining in Burma,
$235,000 for a Mineral Survey in Indonesia, $45,000 for

DFIs in the Bank's region differ great: size anc operational scone, refiecting the reeds of various governmenis
2nd economies for industrial financing. In general, OFIs are
able to channel and disoerse meciurr-term and long-term
development funds to a iarge number of smaller deveiopment projects whicn are too smali for Girect Bank
assistance. This type of assistance tends to promote
strong and effective domestic investment institutions
which can play an imporcant role in mobilizing domestic or
foreign resources,

Drls also undertake promoiiona: activities contributing
to the deveiopment of the privaie industrial sector, the
development of entrepreneurship and the identification of
investment opportunities. In many cases they take the lead
in mobilizing and coordinating efforis of diverse agencies
at overcoming the obstacies to industrialization. They have
aiso contribuiec to the expansion of the financiai infrastruciure in isolated rural areas, bringing about greater
monetization of tne economy, increased incomes and savings mobilization. These institutions a!so function as major
centers for the dissemination of modern management
techniques, :hus helping to raise the leve: of industrial efficiency and productivity.

During the year, the Bank made six loans to DFls, amounting to $127 million. These credits ranged from iwo $40
million loans — one to the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Invesiment Corporation (PICIC) and another to the Small and
Medium Industry Bank in Republic of Korea (SMIB) — toa
$2 million credit to the Deveiopment Bank of, Solomon
Istands (DBS). The DBS! credit has attracted co-financing
of $1.5 million from the International Development Association (!{DA), which based its approval on processing carried
out by the Bank. These loans will be on-lent to smati and
medium-scale industriai enterprises and wil| also serve to
strengthen the institutional and management capabilities
of the DFls themselves.

In addition ta these loans, the Bank also extended additional credits to the Development Finance Corporation of
Ceylon {DFCC) in Sri Lanka and the Philippine Investment
Systems Organization (PISO}, and a first credit to the Myanma Economic Bank (MEB} in Busma. For maximum responsiveness to identified needs and considering the economic
Structures in each of these countries, the DFCC credit includes an allocation for preference share investments
whiie the MEB credit is intended to support the rehabilitation and exsansion of state-owned industrial enterprises
and possibly private sector cooperatives.

At the end of 1980, the Bank had approved 58 credit lines
amounting to $1,106 million to 25 development banks in 17
DMCs. This represented 13.7 per cent of total Bank lending.

 

 

 

Transport and Communications

Theré is a growing demand in the Bank's DMCs for
transportation infrastructure and services needed to accommodate passenger and goods traffic between major urban centers as weil as in the rural areas, increasingly so in
the latter case with the continuing emphasis on susiained
long-term increase in agricultura: production in most
DMCs. The high rate of population growth, increasing ur
SKILLED technician operating a lathe at the Automotive
Components Manufacturing Project in Pakistan which was
assisted by a Bank loan,

banization, rural urban migration, and other variables affecting the direction and growth of economic activities, all
have a direct bearing on the choice of viable transportation
policies and sectoral invesiments. With the rising costs of
energy, the relative energy efficiencies of the various
modes of transportation and the need to conserve energy
have become crucial factors.

During 1980, the Bank continued to support transportation projects, especially those designed to integrate the
rural sector into the total economy and to raise the productive capacity and income of the rural population. A significant development was the approval by the Bank of its first
sector loan for roads, $65 million to assist the Government
of Thailand implement its Highway Sector Development
Plan (1982-86). Sector lending is particularly well suited to
heiping the rapid improvement of rural road networks and
sirengthening the institutions concerned with road
development in the Bank's DMCs. The loan to Thailand will
heip upgrade provincial roads and strengthen national
roads serving rural areas, improve the country’s road infrastructure and strengthen concerned institutions.
Atthough about 80 per cent of Thailand’s population lives in
rural areas and 76 per cent of the labor force earns its
livelinood from agricu‘ture, a large proportion of rural roads
are unpaved and in poor condition and become impassable

 

3940

during the rainy season. The Bank's loan wilt help upgrade
unpaved roads, and improve deterlorating paved roads serying rural areas in support of the Government’s road
development plan for providing reliable, cost-effective
ttansport services which will help raise the living standards
of small-scale farmers.

The Bank also extended a $10 million joan to Sri Lanka
for the Mahaweli Area Roads Developméni Project. This
Project will serve the transport needs of selected areas of
the Mahaweli Ganga Development Program, and will
benefit low-income rural dwellers by creating employment
opportunities and facilitating the settlement of landless
families on viable farm holdings. A $30 million joan was
tade to the Philippines to help reconstruct 370 km. of
toads and improve drainage facilities and bridges connected with 170 km. of roads in rural areas with a view to
further developing the economic potential of some of the
less developed areas of the country, particularly the small
island provinces. A loan of $28 million was also extended to
Indonesia for the betterment of over 400 km. of provincial
and district roads in Central Java and Yogyakarta Provinces. This Project will facilitate the more efficient movement of goods and people in the densely populated rural
areas of Centrai Java. A project preparatory technical
assistance grant for the Rangoon-Prome Road Improvement Project in Burma was approved in the course of the
year as wel! as assistance for Causeway Geotechnical
Studies in Kiribati.

During 1980, the Bank extended four loans amounting to
$89.5 million for ports projects. In general, Bank assistance
for port development has been designed to improve and expand port facilities in DMCs so that increasing volumes of
cargo traffic and trade can be handied, taking into account
the requirements of changing technology in shipping and
cargo handling, in this respect, the emergence of container
traffic and the increasing use of roll-on/roll-off facilities are
particularly significant for many OMCs.

In 1880, the Bank extended $20 million in a biend loan to
Papua New Guinea to expand and improve the facilities at
Lae Port. The objectives of the Project are to provide additional port capacity at Lae to cope with projected traffic
growth up to the year 1990,

At Incheon Port in the Republic of Korea, a $54 million
loan — the Bank’s second loan for this Project — will
enable the port to increase its annual cargo handling
capacity by more than 3.6 million tons by the end of 1983.
The Bank also approved a $15.5 million loan to Burma fora
project to rehabilitate and improve eight outports. This Project, which follows technical assistance extended by the
Bank in 1877, is being co-financed by the OPEG Fund for International Development. A multiproject joan — the Bank's
second such loan — of $1 million was extended to the Gook
Islands to finance constructién and rehabilitation of ports
facilities among other components. ®

In 1980, nine loans totalling $223.4 million were approved
in the Transport and Communications sector, four loans for
ports projects accounting for 40 per cent of the amount
lent, and another five for road projects. At the end of 1980,
the Bank had made 88 loans amounting to $1,281.3 million
tor 79 projects in this sector. Within the sector, roads and
ports projects received the major share of assistance, 56
per cent and 32 per cent, respectively, followed by airports
{7 per cent), railways (4 per cent) and telecommunications (1
per ceni).

Water Supply and Sewerage

A large proportion of the people in Asia are without
reasonable access to a safe and adequate water supply,
and an even grealer number lack proper sanitation
Moreover, the region’s least developed countries are the
most affecied, and their poor the worst sufferers. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 80 per
cent of all diseases in the world are water-related. At any
given time, for example, there are about 150 million people

development of a domestic container terminal.in Asia suffering fror gastro-enteritis, 100 million from
scenistosomiasis, 80 miliion from malaria and over 15
miliion from oncrocerciasis (river blindness). Moreover, itis
estimated that if everyone hac access to safe drinking
water and sanitation, infant mortality would be reduced by
50 per cent woridwide.

In tine with tne United Nations’ international Drinking
Water anc Sanitation Decade, which started in November
1980 anc aims to provide safe drinking water and adequate
sanitation to everyone in the deveioping world by the year
1990, the Bank plans to become increasingly involved in the
Waier Supp'y and Sewerage sector. This sector is particularly important to the nealth and socio-economic progress of Asia, and the Bank is now emphasizing the provision of water supply loans to impoverished rural areas.

In 1980, the Bank approved its first Water Supply sector
ioan, amounting to $32 million, for a Project which will provide potable waiter to 33 small towns and help strengthen
the institutional capabilities of the Water Supply sector in
indonesia. i

Also during 1980, a $2.81 million joan and a technical
assistance grant of $150,000 were provided to assist the
Malaysian Government to empioy consuitants to establish
a Master Pian for the provision of adequate water suppiy
facilities to the entire rural population by 1990".

Two ioans were approved in 1980 for urban sewerage
schemes which wiit lead to significant improvements in the
environment: in the Philippines, a $42.8 miilion loan will
heip to benefit about 3.2 million peopie by rehabititating,
extending and improving the sewerage and sanitation
systems in Manila, and in the Republic of Korea a Bank
loan of $27.9 million will provide a sewerage system for the
two industrial cities of Banweol and Gumi. A $1.65 million
loan was also approved for the expansion of the water Supply system for Honiara, the major urban area in the
Solomon Islands.

In addition to the technical assistance for the Rural
Water Supply Master Plan in Malaysia, a project preparatory iechnical assistance of $100,000 was provided in 1980 for
the Smali Towns Water Suppiy Sector loan in indonesia,
and technical assistance of $125,000 was provided for the
preparation of an Environmental Master Plan for the Han
River Basin in the Republic of Korea.

The Bank approved five loans amounting to $107.16
mitiion for this sector in 1980. Total Bank lending for water
suppty and sewerage projects at the end of 1980 amounted
to $705.8 miliion, covering 36 projects in 13 countries.

Urban Development

The total population of the Bank's DMCs (1.2 billion) is
growing at a rate of 2.3 per cent per annum, while the urban
posulation growth rate is 4 per cent per year. Urban
authorities have not been able to plan for such rapid growth
or to mobilize the resources necessary to expand urban infrastructure and public services. The result is an acute
shoriage of adequate housing, severe traffic congestion,
and inadequate transporiation, public health and sanitary
(water supply, waste disposal and drainage) facilities. In
many cases this nas led to urban underemployment and
unemployment comparable to that found in rura! areas and
squalid urban-squatter settlements where inferior environmental conditions are refiected in a nigh incidence of
water-borne diseases, high infant mortality, high levels of

Bank operations in the Urban Development sector have
been designed to assist DMCs develop strategies for future
urban growth anc io act as a catalyst in implementing such
Strategies by financing projects and providing technical
assistance, and to improve tne capacity of local institutions for efficient urban management. Bank assistance has
traditionally concentrated on water supply and sewerage
projects, but in 1976 the Bank formulatec a comprehensive
and integrated approach, involving urban development

disposal projects, improvement of s!um areas and Shelter
and community facilities for low-income groups. } has
since assisted five DMCs — Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Reoublic of Korea, Malaysia and Thailand — in the implementation of seven urban projects.

Such Bank-financed studies as the multiourpose Bancung Urban Development Project in Indonesia and the Integraied Urban Development of Dacca Metropolitan Area in
Bangladesh, both approved in 1979, emphasize tne importance of a long-term strategy to guide urban growth. The
underlying emphasis is on anintegratec approach to urban
problems. Sanitation, shelter anc sheiter-reiated needs are
not tackled in isolation. These projects are designed to
benefit directly the urban poor and contain technica:

The Bank’s first loan with a major housing component,
approved in 1977, was In Hong Kong for the development of
Sha Tin New Town. Another urban project comprising new
urban centers to achieve a spatialiy-balanced hierarchy of
urban cities was the Trengganu Tengah Township Development Project in Malaysia, approved In 1978. In 1980, the
Bank extended a second loan, amounting to $20 million, for
the Sha Tin New Town Project in Hong Kong. The Bank also
approved a $20 million concessional loan to Thailand fora
project which will provide low-cost accommodation for
about 30,000 people at Bang Plee New Town, one of four
towns included in the Greater Bangkok Master Plan.

At ihe end of 1980, the Bank had approved seven loans
amounting to $139.9 million to the Urban Development sector.

Education

Bank assistance for education has increased markedly in
recent years, as the Bank aims to improve the quality of
selected education programs which help augment manpower resources and upgrade occupational skills in its
DMCs. To date, lending and technical assisiance has tend

ed to concenirate on technical and vocational education,
reflecting the Bank’s policy of supporting educational
development in coordination with overall development
aseds.

Bank-assisted projects have aimed at providing and improving education and training facilities geared to the craft
and middle-level manpower needs of industrial and
agricultural development; they have also frequently included upgrading of curricula, consultancies and fellowships,
educational facilities, staff and student facilities, coordination and management of training resources and manpower
studies. The Bank is also keenly aware of the additional
social and economic benefits which derive from improved
education. These include enhanced social mobility, individual participation in economic development, improved
living standards and additional income redistribution — all
of which are given due consideration in project appraisal.

The Bank's involvement in education is not, however, exclusive to projects in this sector, Attention is paid to educa:
tion and training in Bank-assisted projects in Agriculture
and Agro-Industry, Industry, Development Banks, Transport
and Communications and social infrastructure projects.
Several rural development projects, for example, include
components for the training of farmers and agricultural extension workers, and the training of local staff is a common
feature of Bank credits to DFis. The Bank is currently involved in the study, preparation and implementation of
about 25 technical/vocational education projects in nine
DMCs.

During the year, the Bank approved three loans amounting to $65 million for education. These covered the building
and equipping of additional secondary vocational schools
in Malaysia, the provision ot additional (and the upgrading
of existing) senior technical schools and teacher training
facilities in Indonesia, and the provision of new (and the
upgrading of existing) facilities for ihe training of skilled
workers at vocational institutes and the training of
teachers of vocational and trade skills in Singapore. Educational fellowships to upgrade the skills of teachers featured
in all three projects, and in two of them provision was made
for the revision and upgrading of curricula and the introductlon of the teaching of new technologies through the use of
educational consultants. The Bank also extended technical
assistance to Pakistan for the preparation of a project to introduce vocational subjects in secondary courses, to Sri
Lanka for the upgrading of technical institutes and to Indonesia ior vocational schools.

At the end of 1980, the Bank had approved 16 loans
amounting to $213.8 million for education. It had also extended $2.4 million in technical assistance for 15 projects
in this sector.

Health

The main thrust of the Bank's assistance to the Health
sector is aimed at extending primary health services to
those areas which are critically deficient in such facilities,
and to provide training, equipment and drugs for rural
health centers and district hospitals. The Bank also supports nutrition programs and preventive campaigns such
as malaria control.

The improvement of health and sanitation is also frequently included as a component in Bank-assisted water
supply and sewerage projects as well as rural and urbanIMPROVEMENTS to primary health care facilities are among the main objectives of the Bank’s first program loan to the
health sector in Bangladesh which was approved in 1980. Malaria control is another major component of the pragram.

development projects. During 1980. for exampie, provision
for cura! health centers was incluced in the Bank’s $1
miliion multiproject ioan to the Coox Islands.

In order to identify the primary health care needs of its
CNCs, the Bank undertakes reconnaissance missions. Five
such missions were conducied during 1980 — in
Bangladesh, !ndonesia, Pasua New Guinea, Sri Lanka and
Thailand. .

The Bank Aas greatly Denefitted from its close ties with
such agencies as the World Banx, WHO arc the United Nations Fund for Population Activitigs (UNFPA) in this secior
and, curing 1980, the Bank reached an understanding with

WHO on working arrangements between the two institu- .

tions (see pages 60 and 61).

During the year, the Bank approved its first Pubiic Health
Program ioan, a $15.6 miltion concessional loan for a program which aims to increase the suppiy of essential drugs
and strengthen mataria control operations in Bangladesn.
The Bank also extended technical assistance to four DMCs
— Bangiadesn, Burma, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea
— for studies covering tne entire range of health services,
planning and deiivery — including upgrading of hospitais
and rural nealth centers, drug production and distribution,
provision of medica: equipment and suppiies anc manpower training. At the end of ‘986, the Ban had provided
$54.1 million for three projects in the Hea!tn sector, and
just over $7 million in technical assistance for six projects.

Loan Administration

The main thrust of the Bank's loan administration activities in 1980 was directed towards strengthening project
monitoring and supervision. Improvements have been iniroduced in the Bank's interna! reporting system and review
procedures to ensure that existing or impending problems
or difficulties are discovered at an early stage and remedial
measures taken promptiy. Critica: Path Method (CPM) networks, which indicate the various tasks to be done and
identify the critical activities to be performed within a defined time frame, have been prepared for seiected projects
and are now being usec by staff for monitoring the progress of implementation. The Bank intends to computerize
CPM contro! in the future.

During the year, the Bank conductec¢ studies on general
implementation probiems encountered in some DMCs.
Discussions on strengthening central project impiemeniation agencies were held with concerned officials in two borrowing DMCs and the possibility of the Bank extending
technica! assistance for this purpose is being examined.

The Bank’s Guidelines on Procurement have been reviewed and the relevant working paper has been submitted te
anc initially considered by the Board. Work has also started
on the preparatior of sampie standard documents which

year were given extensive briefings on the Bank’s opera- $ Million
tlons as well as on procurement opportunities available
under the Bank's lending activities.

With regard to consultants, a new registration form —
Data on Consultants (DACON) — has been introduced and
initia! steps have been taken towards computerizing consultants' data available in Bank files. A review of the twoenvelope system for selecting consultants, which was
adopted in 1979, has commenced, together with a study on
the capabilities of local consultants in OMCs to undertake
project consultancy work.

A total of 326 loans were under administration in 1980.
Fifty-two loans became effective and 18 loans were closed!
during the year. The total! value of coniracts awarded during the year was $841 million, while disbursement
amounted to $578 million. The ratios of cumulative
amounts of contracts awarded and disbursed relative to
the total arnount of effective loans as of the end of 1980
were 57 per cent and 46 per cent, respectively, compared
with 55 per cent and 47 per cent, respectively, in 1979,

There were 315 projects reviewed in 1980, representing 104
per cent of the total number of projects under active imslementation. The number of projects reviewed in 1980 was
24.5 pe: cent higher than in 1979 and this was partly due to
the nigher number of multiproject missions undertaken in
1980. :

in order to help borrowers improve their capabitities for
implementing projects, the Bank conducted three seminars
in 1980 for staff of executing agencies, two on Procurement
and Disbursement and one on Project Impiemeniation
Management. A total of 59 senior and middle-level officials
from 47 project executing agencies, planning agencies and
state banks in 17 DMCs participated in these seminars. In
addition, Bank staff cooperated with some government
agencies in organizing and conducting seminars in Burrna,
Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Lao People’s Democratic
Republic, Nepal, Pakistan and Singapore. .

Projects Completed

A total of 15 projects involving Bank loans of $229.5
miltion were completed in 1980, bringing the total number
of projects completed to 152 out of 455 projects approved
to the end of the year. During 1980, 25 Project Completion
Reports (PCRs) were completed compared with 16 in 1979.
The {essons learned from the experience contained in these
reports are being consolidated and wili be made available
to Bank staff for their information and future guidance.

Post-Evaluation

During 1980, the role of post-evaluation was further
strengthened as an integral part of the Bank's operations.
The Post-Evatuation Office (PEO) continued to focus on the
preparation of Project Performance Audit Reports (PPARs)
which evaluate, verify and audit the findings of Project
Completion Reports (PCRs) prepared by the respective Project Departments. The purpose of ihe PPARs is to assess
completed projects independenily in terms of their design,
implementation and achievement of stated objectives. The
findings and recommendations of PPARs are examined by
the Bank with a view to improving its future operations.

During 1980, 13 Post-Evaluation Reports (PERs), including 12 PPARs, were completed. These reports covered
17 Bank loan and technical assistance projects.

A new feature of post-evaluation activities during 1980
was the issuance of reviews summarizing the findings and
recommendations of PERs. The first reviewed the 19 PERs,
covering 20 projects, which were completed prior.to 1979,
while the second summarized the findings of the eight
PERs. covering 11 projects, which were circulated in 1979.
t is now proposed that simitar reviews will be issued annually covering the PERs circulated in the previous year.

The Posi-Evaluation Office aiso reported on ihe implementation status of recommendations made in the
PERs issued thus far. For those compieted prior to 1979,
the impiementation status was shown in an appendix to the
first review. A separate report was circulated on the implementation status of the recommendations contained in
the eight PERs completed in 1979.

previous year. Project preparatory technical assistance
amounted to $8 million for 43 projects while advisory and
operational assistance amounted to $6.2 million for 13 projects. These amounts included technical assistance grant
components incorporated in nine Bank loans, amounting to
$6.1 million, of which $1.3 million was for project preparation and $4.8 million for advice and implementation.
Technical assistance grants are financed mainly from
the Bank's Technical Assistance Special Fund (see page

The importance of technical assistance to the Bank’s
lending program is underscored by the fact that by the end
of #980, 164 Bank loans, amounting to $2,769 million, had
resulted from earlier technical assistance provided by the
Bank, amounting to $37.2 million. In 1980, 32 loans amounting to $731 million resulted from earlier technical
assistance; of this, $352 million was from OCR and $379
million from SF, representing 37 per cent and 79 per ceri,
respectively, of the tota! loan approvals from these sources
in 1980, This also emphasizes the importance of technical
assistance in Bank lending operations to the low-income
DMCs.

A total of 37 technical assistance projects was completed in 1980, 26 for project preparation and 11 for adyisory and operational purposes, bringing the total number
of technical assistance projects completed to 251. The
total amount of technical assistance grants provided to
DMCs as of the end of 1980 stood at $75.2 million’ (see

Regional Energy Survey (RES): Work on the RES, approved by the Board in April 1980, commenced in early June
1980 with the help of a team of consultants. The primary
objective of the technical assistance was to obtain for the
Bank adequate information on the energy situation in the
DMCs for formulating a more effective program of
assistance to this sector. The survey included a broad
assessment of the existing and prospective energy demand
and supply situation in the DMCs, a review of their indigenous energy resources, evaluation of various energy
development and demand management options available
to them and identification of the areas and the manner in
which they most need external assistance. It is expected
that the survey will provide the Bank with information on
the DMCs' energy sector programs, problems and priorities
and help the Bank in shaping its sector assistance activities in the future. At the end of the year, the field work
and most of the analysis for the survey were completed and
the main report was under preparation.TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE APPROVALS BY SECTOR, 1979, 1980, 1967-1980* :

and Social Information.

Lending and Operational Policies

Lending and Relending Policies

The Board reviewed and ‘argely reaffirmed the Bank's
policies on choice of borrowers, lending terms and amortization, reiending of proceeds of Bank loans, anc dispasition of counterpart funds.

In choice of borrowers, the Bank in its OCR operations
preters iending direct to the entity carrying out the projects,
and in its SF operations to the Governmen: of the membder
country where the project is locatec.

The final maturity of an OCR loan wil: be determined by

roject considerations, especiaiiy the economic life of the
project. but due accourt may aiso be iaken of country cansiderations. The grace period wili be determinec mainly oy
the time needed before the project concerned becomes
operationai and starts to yie‘d returns, there may de slight
modifications on country and project grounds. Exceptions
to this method of determining final maturity and grace
period are OCR !oans to Hong Kong and Singapore, loans
to DFis, program loans anc technical assistance foans.

Baluchistan Livestock Development Project in Pakistan
which is being supported by a Bank joan following earlier
technical assistance.

In determining the terms of reiending or on-lending of the
proceecs of Bank loans, the Bank recognizes three
categories of beneficiaries. For Government agencies and
instrumentalities entrusted with impiementing the Government's special sociai and economic policies, the Bank will
be prepared — mainly in OGR lending — io alow loan proceeds to be relent on the same terms as those of the Bank
ican, however, the appiication of terms harder than those
of the Bank loan wil! not be ruled out. Such harder terms
would be more usual in SF iending. -or commercially-run
public corporations, relending terms harder than these of
tne Bank will generaily apply. For private enterprises, ihe
reiending terms wiil be determined by the cost of external
capita! and lending terms prevailing in the local market.

On the use of counterpart funds generazec in Bankfinanced activities, the Bank will not in principle exercise
control over them. However, when countersart funds accrue to a financia: intermediary, it may be recuired to use
the funds for particular deve:ooment aciivities.

Streamlining of Loan and Technical Assistance
Processing .

The Bank nas adosted severa! measures to streamline
loan and technica: assistance processing which has, in the
past, been subject to various de:ays and impediments. It
was decided tnat the President might acprove technica!56

assistance projects that do not give rise to unusual obligations or raise special policy issues, each involving an
amount not exceeding $250,000; that for project preparation technical assistance projects involving amounts not
exceeding $50,000 each, with no substantial underiaking
from the recipient country, no formal agreement or report to
the Board wouid be needed following approval by the President, and that approval by the Board on a no-objection
basis would be sought for technical assistance projects to
be executed by the Bank but financed entirely by other
sources, if these involve amounts exceeding $250,000.
Documentation for all technical assistance projects would
be simplified considerably, and in certain cases advance
action for the engagement of consuliants might be taken
with the prior approval of the Board on a no-objection
basis.

In loan processing, it was decided that the condition on
ihe effectiveness of loans involving co-financing by the
Bank and other sources be made more flexible in the interest of smoother implementation of the projects concerned and that, with the agreement of the country concerned,
the Bank might atiempt to limit to a reasonable number
other co-financiers in any single. project. For loans to be appraised and administered by the Bank but financed exclusively by other organizations under general co-operation
arrangements, specific Board approval of individual projects would not be required, provided that the Board be furnished in advance with the pertinent information. In addition, the Board agreed, among other things, to simplify the
approval procedure for loans not exceeding $10 million in
gach case,

It was also decided to introduce indicative three-year aggregate lending levels. This would be in addition to the present annual indicative aggregate fevels. There would be
over-programming of not less than 25 to 30 per cent of planned annual lending levels, and sector programming should

be given greater attention in the Bank's country program: *

ming exercises.

Sector Lending

In June 1980, the Bank decided to undertake sector lending in appropriate circumstances. The Bank's sector loans
will finance primarily the capital requirements of specific
sectors and will also help DMCs strengihen sector policies
and institutions, Such loans, for example, could be designed to expand the network of secondary and feeder roads or
sural water supply or power transmission and distribution
tacilities {including rural electrification). Sector loans may
also be well suited to meeting, among others, development
needs in agriculture and rural development, irrigation and
drainage, railways, highways, sanitation, public health and
population.

Sector tending will generally involve financing the foreign
exchange costs of subprojects in a sector which are consistent with the broad purposes of the sector loan. Sector
loans may, in appropriate cases, also finance local currency expenditures and recurring costs of the subprojects.

Since institution-building is a key element in sector lending, the Bank will extend the technical assistance
necessary to strengthen the capabilities of the borrower/executing agencies. Ai the same time, if technical and
management capacities of executing agencies permit,
there would be considerable delegation of responsibilities

from the Bank to the borrowertexecuting agencies, It 1s envisaged that sector loans will need lo be relatively large to
be effective. The additional responsibilities placed on the
borrower/executing agencies will also have to be recognized.

Bank Operations in the Agriculture Sector in
the South Pacific

During the year, the Board approved new policy recommendations for Bank Operations in the Agriculture Sector
in the South Pacific which are designed to streamline and
improve the quality of its assistance to its geographically
isolated DMCs, many ol which have smalier-based
economies, in the South Pacific region (see page 59)

These policy recommendations call for the Bank to involve itself in the examination of the need for a Regional
Research Cenler which would carry out research on a
number of root crops which are unique io the South Pacific
and on coconut, a crop of fundamental importance to the
economies of most South Pacific Developing Member
Countries {SPDMCs)}, The Bank's involvement should be in
the form of assistance in undertaking a pre-feasibility
study, in association with interested bilateral sources, subject to support for the study being given by the SPDMCs
themselves. It is also recommended ihat the Bank place
greater emphasis on project preparation of project components which can increase agricultural prodyctivity and
income through the introduction of suitable non-tabor inputs in those areas where labor is in short supply and
employment generation is not a dominant goal.

The policy recommendations also stressed the need for
the Bank to assist SPDMCs develop more commercially
oriented smaliholder management systems; upgrade and
expand agricultural extension services and management
training; develop nationai agricultural research; involve
more local personnel in the preparation of rural development projects; exploit their substantial marine resources;
and continue — if possible, increase — the channelling of
funds for agriculture through DFls.

The Bank will also have to recognize the critical role of
inter-island marine transportation and assist the SPDMCs,
wherever it is feasible, by ensuring greater integration between transport services and agricultural development projects. It was also recommended that the Bank should provide assistance where possible in developing markets and
assisting in the establishment and upgrading of marketing
organizations, especially for fresh food and fish.

Review of Arrangements for Lending from the
Asian Development Fund

The Board reviewed and reaffirmed the appropriateness
of per capita GNP and debi repayment capacity as the two
criteria for determining the access of DMCs to ADF lending
during the remaining years of the Second Replenishment of
ADF (ADF II!}, 1980-82. The main conclusions reached were
as follows:

(i) The classification of countries into three groups!

and the countries within each group remains unchanged.

1 Excluding India, which nas nol applied to Ihe Bank lor assistance.(iif

Group A — Afgnanistan, Bana!acesh, Burma. Cambodia, Cook Is:ands, Kiribati, Lao PDR,
Maidives. Nepal. Pakistan, So!omon
Islands, Sri Larka, Tonga, Viet Nam ane
Western Samoa.

Group 8 — Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines and Thailand.

Group C — Republic of China, Fiji, Hong Kong,
Repubiic of Korea, Malaysia and
Singapore.

Tre DMCs in Group A will continue te be given first
priority in the allocation of ADF resources. Among
OMCs in Group A, specia! attention will be given io
the least developed and the most seriously affected
DMCs. Some DMGs ir Group A may be provided with
mocest amounts of OCR ioans if their need for
deveiooment financing is greater than can be
reasonably provided from avaiiabie ADF resources
and the countries have the capacity to absorb such
modest amounts of OCR loans.

Considering the current economic circumstances
and prospects of Group B DMCs, it woud not be
necessary to provide access to ADF resources to Indonesia during 1980-82 unless there is any signifi
cant development during the period that adversely
affects the economic situation or prospects of the
country, Other OMCs in Group B, i.e. Papua New
Guinea, Phitiopines and Thailand, may be provided
with modest amounts cf ADF resources for financing

of projects having @ frigrk social content. Tris
criterion need not aways aoply to Papua New
Guinea which may continue to receive a softer blend.
The total amount of ADF lencing to these three
DMCs in Graup B should not exceed 10 per cent of
annual ADF program levels.

Review of OCR Lending Program in 1980-82

The OCR lending program of the Bank tor 1980-82 was apProved by the Board in 1978 uring its annual review of the
financial policies of the Bank. However, the persisting
severe inflationary pressures in recent years have led to
substantial increases in project costs. The current high
rate of inflatior 1s hkely 10 continue in the next few years,
reducing the volume of real assistance provided by the
Bank. In view of these developmenis, the Board reviewed
and approved an upward revision of OCR tending ievels for
1980, 1981 and 1982 from $900 million, $975 mitlion and
$1,050 million to $860 million, $1,105 milion and $1,270
miliion, respectively.

Review of DMC Resource Requirements and
the Bank’s Lending Program in 1983-87

At the 1980 Annuai Meeting, the Board of Governors
passed a resoiution requesting the Board of Directors to
undertake a study of the Bank’s future resource requirements. Two working papers — one examining the externa: resource requirements of the borrowing DMCs in the

LABORATORY work at Hankook Caprolactam Corporation's Ulsan plant in the Republic of Korea. This Bank-assisted Project
produces Caprolactam, w.
a :

  

hich is used in the production of nylon 6 filament, for domestic us

é and export.

_ 558

1980s and the other dealing with poticy changes and new
initiatives that would be relevant in the context of increased lending levels in the 1980s — were prepared and a first
round of discussion held by the Board in November 1980.

Environmental Considerations in Bank
Operations

In January 1980, the Board of Directors discussed a
paper on Environmental Gonsiderations in Bank Operations and agreed with steps to be taken to ensure that environmental implications were systematically considered
and monitored in the Bank's project activities.

Public Utility Tariffs

The Board also commenced consideration, on the basis
oi a working paper, of a possible framework of policies and
guidelines relating to tariff and connected provisions that
could be incorporated in loans given by the Bank to assist
various types of public utilities in DMCs.

Policies Under Review

At the end of 1980, two other papers on the resource requirements of the Bank — namely, Staffing Implications of
the Bank's Proposed Lending Program (1983-87}, Review of
the Bank‘s Resource Position and Proposal for an Increase
in the Bank's Capital Stock — were circulated for consideration by the Board in early February 1981. Papers on
other policy issues, namely, Technical Assistance Special
Fund: Arrangements for Resource Mobilization, a Currency
Pooling Scheme, Equity Financing, Review of Local Cost
Financing, Review of Program Lending, 6.2(0) Resources
and Resident Offices, are also under preparation and will
be circulated to the Board in early 1981, In addition, work
had commenced on a paper on the Third Replenishmeni of
the Asian Development Fund (ADF IV).

Inter-Agency Cooperation

During the year, the Bank continued to maintain close
contacts with other institutions interested in the economic
development of the Asian and Pacific region. These contacts ranged from high-level official meetings to more informal exchanges of information on operational activities and
policy, In particular, contacts with the World Bank group,
the International Fund for Agricultural Development, ihe
OPEC Fund for International Development and the European Economic Community were strengthened, leading to

co-financing of various projects in DMCs, and cooperation 
with the Food and Agriculture Organization was broadened. During the year, the Bank also entered into a
cooperative arrangement for financing development projects and technical assistance in DMCs with the Government of Switzerland.

Meeting of International Development
Financing Institutions

The President of the Bank attended the Annual Meeting
of the Regional Development Banks/World Bank and other
international Financial Institutions (IFis) in Washington,
D.C. in September 1980. The meeting was also aitended by
the Presidents of the African Development Bank and the

representatives of the Islamic Development Bank, the
OPEC Fund for International Development, the tnternational Fund for Agricultural Development, the Commission
of the European Community and the European Investment
Bank.

The participants in the meeting exchanged views on a
wide range of issues and problems currently confronting
the IFls. The issues and problems discussed included the
question of recycling, financing of energy resource
development, various techniques of lending, problems of
project implementation and the question of directing
resources to low-income groups. A general understanding
was reached that, in light of the increasing resources gap
faced by the oil-importing developing countries, the IFls
should play a larger role in the future and should do
everything possible to help increase the absorptive capacity of the borrowing countries so as to speed up and increase the transfer of resources.

World Bank Group (Including Development
Committee Meeting)

During the year, the Bank maintained close contact with
the World Bank through frequent visits of officials, ex-change of documents ana information on operational activities anc policies, the coordination of assistance activities in particular DMCs anc co-financing.

A high-levet coordination meeting Detween the Bank and
the World Bank was held in Apri: in Manila at tne Bank's
headquarters. The meeting discussed overail policy matters of interest to Doth institutions, covering a wide range
of togics including the maior doiicy issues confronting the
commor. borrowing countries in the 1980s. The meeting
also discussed responses to these issues inciuding
baiance of payments management, industry and trade
poiicies for export expansion, energy policy, aspects of
employment generation and poverty atleviation, constraints on and potentials for increased food production
and the consideration of environmenta: aspects in prorect
formulation and implementation.

The Bank was represented at the Thirteenth Meeting of

 

the Development Committee of the !MF-Worlc Bank neld in”

Hamburg in April. The Committee considered papers submitted by the Worla-Bank on sending for structural acjustmeni and on co-financing, and 2 progress renort by the IMF
on recent develooments relating to IMF faciiities. The Committee also reviewed recent deveiooments relating to the
propesals of the Group of 24 for a Program o? Immediate
Action.

The Fourteenth Meeting of the Development Committee,
held in Washington, D.C. in September, was attended by
the President of the Bank. The Committee discussed
medium-term prospects for the worid economy anc particuiarly their impact on the oil-importing developing countries. It also reviewed the recommendations of the Brandi

Commission, welcomed ine World Bank's initiatives to |

establish an energy affiliate and urged the Wortd Bank to
explore appropriate ways to increase its lending capacity in
light of the new requirements for structural adjustment and
energy iending as wel! as expected operations in ihe People’s Repubiic of China. The President made a statement
on the externa! assistance required by the Bank’s DMCs
and the rojie which the Bank expected to play in the coming
years.

During the year, the Bank was also represented in an
observer capacity at the aid coordination meetings convened by the World Bank for Bangladesh, Burma, Republic of
Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

Co-financing between tne Bank and the World Bank.

reached a high level in 1980, with five projects co-financed
dy the two institutions invoiving Worlc Bank loans of $202
million. Of this amount, $198.5 miliion was made available
by the World Bank for co-financing three projects, one each
in Indonesia, Pakistan and Philippines, and the balance of
$3.5 million for two projects, one each in Solomon Islands
and Western Samoa.

During the year, the Bank and the World Bank reached an
understanding on co-financing projects in three South
Pacitic countries which are members of both institutions,
namely, Fiji, Solomon Islands, ana Western Samoa. For
projects in these countries which the Bank and the World

Bank have agreed to co-tinance, the Sank will carry out pro
ject appraisai on behalf of the World Bank and itself, administer the World Bank co-financing, anc monitor the
overail project impiementation. This cooperation agreement has been applied to two projects in Soiomon tslands
and Wesiern Samoa which were co-financed by the two inStitutions in 1980.

international Fund for Agricultura!
Development

Under the aegis of the Cooperation Agreement detween
the Internationa: Fund for Agricui:urai Deve:opment (1FAD)
and the Bank, conciuded in 1978, ciose cocperation and
consultation Detween tne two bodies was maintained in
1980. The Bank appraised three projects for exciusive financing by iFAD during the year. These three — one each in
Banglasesn, Nepal anc Pakistan — involved IFAD financing amounting to $49 mii:ion. Two additional projects, in indonesia anc Western Samoa, were also processed by the
Bank for exciusive financing by IFAD. During 1980, a project in Sri Lanka was co-financed with IFAD, the respective
contributions being $14.5 milion by IFAB anc $15 milion
by the Bank.

 

 

OPEC Fund for International Development

The Bank continued to cooperate with the OPEC Func for
international Develapment {iormerly tne OPEC Special
Fund) in 1980. During the Bank’s Annual Meeting held in
Aprii-May 1980, discussions were held between the celegation of the OPEC Fund, ceiegations from several DMCs anc
Bank siaff on development assistance from the OPEC
Fund. In 1980, the OPEC Fund coniriduted $19 million for
co-financing three projects, one each in Burma, Philippines
and Sri Lanka, with tne Bank.

development of water supply facilities to meet demand up
to the mid 1980s.Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research

The Bank has been a member of the Consultative Group
on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) since the
Group was founded in 1971, GGIAR is an informal group of
countries, international development agencies, and private
foundations which supports 13 international agricultural
research organizations with the aim of developing improved technology to facilitate increased production and better
quality of food in developing countries. As the Annual
Meetings of the Group have always been held in
Washingion, the Bank has not normally been represented.
in 1980, however, the meeting was held in Manila and the
Bank actively participated with a four-man delegation led
by the Vice-President for Operations.

United Nations Development Programme

In 1980, the close cooperation between the Bank and the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in
assisting DMCs with technical assistance for project
preparation and advisory services was further enhanced by
the conclusion of a “provisional interest” procedure between the two institutions, similar to the arrangements
UNDP has with the World Bank and other regional development banks. Under this arrangement, the Bank is given the
opportunity to examine and comment on UNDP draft country programs and to express provisional interest in projects
which fulfil! Bank criteria in terms of Investment potential.
Apart from the frequent contacts between the Bank and
UNDP Headquarters and field offices, senior staff of the
Bank and UNDP visited each other's Headquarters during
the year for very fruitful consuitations and exchanges of information. The Bank was also represented at various UNDP
meetings such as the Twenty-Seventh Session of the
Governing Council, the Global Meeting of UNDP Representatives, and the Inter-Governmental Meeting on InterCountry Programming for the Least Developed Countries in
Asia and the Pacific. During the year, the Bank agreed to
act as Executing Agency for 10 projects wholly or partly
financed by UNDP, amounting to $5.7 million, UNDP also
approved additional financing, amounting to $461,497, for
two projects which were approved by the Bank in 4978 and
4979, and was expected to provide $527,220 for a project approved in 1980.

Food and Agriculture Organization

There was extensive cooperation between the Bank and
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAQ) in the
preparation of loan projects in 1980. This took the form of

-formal technical assistance projects involving cost-sharing

by the two organizations in six cases — Community
Forestry in both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh; Rice Storage
and Second Forestry Project in Burma; Cotton Development in the Philippines; and a Crop intensification Program
in Nepal. In addition, FAO assisted the Bank with the formulation of a fisheries project in Kiribati and it is also
preparing the Sulawesi Area Development Project in Indonesia on behalf of the Bank for exclusive financing by
IFAD in 1981, During the year, discussions were held between FAO and the Bank concerning possible revision of the

 

interim Arrangements for Cooperative Action between the
two bodies which were approved in 1968 and have guided
cooperative activities since that time.

European Economic Community

During the year, the European Economic Community
(EEC) agreed to provide grant funds amounting to $26.8
million from its aid budgets for financing four projecis in
cooperation with the Bank. Of this, $20 million was
allocated for co-financing three Bank projects, one each in
Indonesia, Nepal and Pakistan, and the balance of $6.7
million for exclusive financing of another project in Burma
jointly with the Government of Switzerland. ln addition,
EEC made available $35 million under its Special Action
Program for co-financing a project in Pakistan with the
World Bank, the Bank and a bilateral source. €EC also con:
tributed $658,000 for financing three technical assistance
projects in Indonesia, Pakistan and Thailand approved by
the Bank in 1980, as well as $350,000 for a technical
assistance project in the Philippines approved by the Bank
in 1979."

Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific

The Bank maintains close contact with ithe Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) in
order to benefit from the various development issues relevant {o DMGs thai are discussed in the meetings organized
by ESCAP. Among the important ESCAP meetings attended
by Bank staff during 1980 were the Thirty-Sixth Session of
ESCAP, held in Bangkok In March, and the Twenty-Third
Session of the ESCAP Committee on Trade, held in
Bangkok in November.

Other International Organizations

During the year, the Bank maintained and strengthened
its close relationship with the World Health Organization
(WHO), especially in view of WHO's ready capability for providing needed expertise in various fields of mutual interest.
The Bank has worked closely with the three WHO Regional
Offices concerned with the DMCs (located in Manila, New
Delhi and Alexandria) and with WHO country representatives, WHO representatives and experts have assisted
Bank missions in Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, Pakistan,
Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka and Thailand. WHO also provided an expert team to implement the technical assistance
study of Malaria Control, Training and Research in Nepal.
The Bank has also been represented at meetings convened
by WHO to discuss the financing of primary health care in
the Asian Region, and the establishment of a phar
maceutical service for South Pacific countries. During
4986, WHO also provided $150,000 for financing consultant
services for the Bank-assisted Public Health Program in
Bangladesh.

Working arrangements for cooperation and consultation
between WHO and the Bank have been discussed at staff

aiready been prepared ny other agencies. The cooperative
arrangements between tne major international devesiopment assistance organizations party to the Declaration wili
assist tne Bank considerably as it increases its efforts to
take proper account of environmental issues (See nage 58)

During 1980, the Bank maintained liaison and consultative arrangements with the International Labour

IORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES
AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Review of the Bank’s Resource Requirements

AT THE Thirteenth Generai Meeting. the Boare of Governors considered a report of the Board of Directors on tne
Resources of the Bank anc adopted Resolution No. 134.
The Board of Governors, recognizing the need for a study of
the Bank's future resource requirements, requestec the
Board o? Directors to undertake such a study and io report
its findings and recommencations to the Board of Governors for consideration and action. In this connection, four
Working Papers were sudmitied to ihe Board of Directors in
1980.

Capital

The authorized capital stock of tne Bank as of 31
December 1980 stood at $9,209.2 miliion (SDR 7,220.6
miilion}, of which the subscribed portion amounted to
$8,828.1 million (SDR 6,921.7 million).

Progress of Second General Capital Increase

As of 31 December 1980, 40 member countries had made
subscriptions, amounting to $4.913.8 million (SDR 3,852.7
million}, to the second genera! capital increase. During
1980, Italy and Kiribati took up their full capital subscription entitlements, amounting to $86.1 million (SDR 67.5
million) and $0.3 million (SDR 0.2 million), respectively. The
Unitec States also made a further partial subscription of
$162.6 million (SDR 127.4 million) in 1980."

Valuation of Capital

Since the coming into effect of the Second Amendment
to the Articles of Agreement of the International Moneiary
Fund (IMF) on 7 April 1978, currencies no longer have par
values in terms of gold. The implications of this change on
the basis o* valuation of the Bank's capital stock is still
under consideration by the Bank. Meanwhile, the Bank’s
capital stock has been valued for purposes of its financial
siatements on the basis of SDR 10,000 per share. The SDR
is expressed in tne Bank's financial statements in current

Borrowings

as summarized in the Tabie on page 74, amounting to the
equivalent of $457.8 miliion.? Although tne extremely

markets made selection and timing of borrowings particularly difficult, the Bank was able to arrange the borrowings on comparatively favorable terms. Furthermore, the
Bank was able to continue its efforts to secure longer
maturities, and for the second year in succession arranged
a long-term syndicated loan in Japan. This was the Bank’s
largest borrowing in the private capital markets in Japan.
The average maturity of the year's borrowings, weighted by
amount, was 10.01 years, compared with 10.25 years in
1979.

Two public bond issues were made in the Federal
Republic of Germany. The first, in May, for a principal
amount of DM200 million, was the largest Deutsche Mark
borrowing the Bank has undertaken so far. The second
issue, in November, was for DM100 million.

In April two-year US dollar bonds totalling $70 million
were placed with central banks and monetary authorities in
28 member countries. The Bank's two-year bonds have in
effect been an important source of long-term funds and
have been significant in sustaining cooperative efforts
among its members. The issue in April was to replace the
Bank's Two-Year Bonds of 1978, and carried an interest rate
of 14.45 per cent per annum which reflected the high interest rates prevailing at the time of issue.

Taking advantage of the comparatively low interest rates
in the Swiss capital market, the Bank, for the first time,
made two public bond issues in this market in a year.

BORROWINGS, 1986

Towards the end of the year the Bank arranged a private
placement with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency for
SwF 100 million, thereby facilitating the flow of funds to the
region from one of the oil exporting countries. The borrow:
ing was signed in February 1981.

Review of Financial Policies

The Annual Review of the Bank's Financial Policies took
place early in the year and encompassed the Bank's lending program, financial objectives and indicators, liquidity
policy, borrowing program and the determination of the
Bank's lending rate. The review concluded that the principles which underhe the Bank’s financial policies were
sound and should continue to guide the Bank's financial
operations. The review also proposed continuatian of the
phased program of borrowings bearing in mind the
developments of the past year and the neéd to achieve a
smooth progression of the Bank's borrowings in the future.

Lending Rate

The fending rate was set at 8.10 per cent per annum eftective 1 January, 1980, subject to a mid-year review. This
was done ta July and the tending rate was increased to 9.00
per cent per annum with effect from i July 1980. During ihe

Currency Scheme for Disbursement of Loans to
DFlIs

Earty in the year, the Bank introducec a disbursement
scheme, effective 15 February 1980, for equaiizing and
reducing the incidence of exchange risk of Development
Finance Institutions and other intermediaries in the OMCs
which borrow from the Bank's ordinary capital resources.
Under the scheme, disbursements are made 50 per cent in
United States dollars and 50 per cent in any other convertibie currency or currencies. in addition, subject to the
Bank's debt and asset management requirements, the
Bank accommodates as far as possibie borrowers’ proposals to repay the currencies on a pro-rata or other preferred basis.

holdings.” Further action on maintenance of value due to
changes in exchange rates have been held in abeyance
pending a decision on the valuation of the Bank's capital
stock.

Loan Disbursements and Repayments

Disbursements from ordinary capital resources in 1980
amounted to $428.7 miilion compared with $361 million in
1979, representing an increase of $67.7 million or 18.8 per
cent. Cumulative disbursements from this source at the
end of 1980 reached $2,304.7 million. Repayments during
the year on loans heid by the Bank under ordinary capital
resources amounted to $101.2 miilion, and on loans sold to
participants to $0.1 million, making a total of $101.3 miilion.
Corresponding figures for cumulative repayments up to ihe
enc of 1980 are $366.5 million anc $14.0 million, respectively, amounting to $379.5 milion.Investments

Al the end of 1980, the Bank's investments — held in 23
separate currencies — amounted to the equivalent of
$1,393.1 million, including investments of Special Reserve
Fund Assets. Of the total investments, 24.4 per cent was
held in securities issued or guaranteed by member governments and obligations of approved government agencies of
member countries. The rest was invested In time deposits
and certificates of deposit with banks in member couniries
and the Bank for international Settlements.

Of the government, agency and governmeni-guaranteed
securities, 23 per cent were in securities maturing within
one year and 77 per cent in securities maturing after one
year up io five years three months. Of the time deposits and
certificates of deposit, 41 per cent were in deposits maturing within one year and 59 per cent in deposits maturing
after one year up to five years.

Income and Expenses

The Bank's gross income in 1280 rose to $309.6 million,
representing an increase of $48.8 million or 18.7 per cent
over $266.8 miilion in 1979. This increase is primarily due to
higher income from both Joans and invesiments. Loan income in 1980 registered an increase of 16.5 per cent over
that of 1979 while investment income grew by 20.5 per cent
over the same period.

Buring 1980, total expenses amounted to $163.2 million
registering an increase of $20.8 million or 14.6 per cent over
1979, Financial expenses, administrative expenses (after
deducting: $20.3 million for Administrative Charge to
Special Operations) and Services to Member Countries
were 12.8 per cent, 27.0 per cent and 143.3 per cent higher,
respectively, than those of 1979,

Gain from Changes in Value of Currencies

In 1980, there was a net gain of $4.8 million primarily on
translations of currency holdings in excess of maintenance
of value ceilings as compared to a net Joss of $18.5 million
in 1979.

Net Income

Net income for 1980, after appropriation of commissions
io Special Reserve, amounted to $131.8 million, compared
with $83 million in 1979, The improvement was due to the increase in gross income and a net gain from changes in
value of currencies.

The accumulated net income as of 31 December 1979,
amounting to $83 million, was allocated to the Ordinary
Reserve in accordance with a resolution adopted by the
Board of Governors at the Thirteenth Annual Meeting. The
Ordinary Reserve was also credited with the $9.3 million
arising from the restatement of the Bank’s capital stock by

the substitution, for purposes of the financial statements,
of the SDR for the 1966 dollar as unit of value. The Ordinary
Reserve thus increased from $298.8 million as of 34
December 1979 to $391.2 million as of 31 December 1980.
The Special Reserve increased by $19.3 million from commissions on loans during 1980, from $59.3 million as of 31

77SPECIAL FUNDS

AT THE end of 1980; 14 donor countries had deposited Instruments of Contribution to the second Asian Development Fund replenishment (ADF Ill). Release of funds from
the Bank's 1980 concessional tending program was,
however, delayed by more than six months and did not occur until July when the first instalment of the United States
contribution and the second instalments of the other ADF
lll contributions became available for loan commitments.
With the availability of the second instalment of the United
States contribution in December, the third instalments of
other ADF II contributions became due for release on 1
January 1981, thereby assuring the Bank of adequate
resources for its 1981 concessional lending program.

By Governors’ Resoiution No. 136, adopted in October
1980, the final date for payment by the United States of the
last $60 million of its contribution to the first Asian
Development Fund repienishment (ADF Il) was extended to
30 September 1981. At the end of the year, the necessary
legislative action to enable the United States to make this
payment was pending.’

During the year the Bank transferred to ADF the remaining balance of resources in the Multi-Purpose Special Fund
(MPSF) and wound up its administration of MPSF?

Eight member countries made additional contributions
to the Technica! Assistance Special Fund (TASF) during the
year (see page 83) and one member country, France, made
its first contribution.

ADF Ill in an aggregate amount of $2,150 million (at 1 April
4978 exchange rates), consisting of a basic replenishment
total of $2,000 million plus a further $150 million in supplementary contributions. The replenishment, intended to
cover the Bank’s concessionai lending program over the
four-year period 1979-82, came into effect on 29 March 4979

when the Bank received unqualified Instruments of Contribution for an amount in excess of the trigger figure of
$1,000 million provided in the Resolution.

At the end of 1980, 14 countries had deposited Instruments of Contribution to ADF Ill. Of these, 13 countries,
namely, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,
Finland, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom, had
deposited unqualified Instruments of Contribution, while
one country, the United States, had deposited a qualified
Instrument of Contribution in accordance with the provisions of Resolution No. 121. The contributions provided for
under these Instruments amounted to a total of $2,014
million equivalent (at 1 April 1978 exchange rates). At the
end of the year, completion of legislative action to enable
Italy and Netherlands to deposit Instruments of Contribution was still awaited."

Resolution No. 121 envisages that unqualifieé contributions would be made available to the Bank for loan commitment over the replenishment period in four equal annual instalments. Pursuant to the Resolution, the first instalments
of unqualified contributions became available upon the effectiveness of such contributions. The Resolution envisages that the secand, third and fourth instalments of unqualified contributions would be released only if onefourth, one-half and three-fourths, respectively, of each
qualified contribution has previously become unqualified
and available for loan commitments. To meet the 1980 concessional lending program, release of the second instaiments was to occur on t January 1980. However, as the
United States was unable to deposit an Instrument of Contribution and make available its first instalment by that
date, release of the second instalments of the other contributions was delayed.

As a result of the ensuing shortage of ADF resources,
ioans considered during the first half of 1980 were approved by the Board of Directors subject to the condition that
they would be signed if and when adequate ADF resources
became availiable. To resolve this situation the Bank, in accordance with the Resolution, convened a special meeting
of ADF donor countries in Geneva on 29 and 30 May 1980 to
discuss measures for obtaining the necessary contribution

First Replenishment {ADF HI)

The first ADF repienishment (ADF I, authorized in
December 1975, by Resoiution No. 92 of the Board of Governors, was designed to finance the Bank's concessional lending grogram over the three-year period 1976-78. The total
amount author.zed was $830 million, later revised to $809
miilion to be provided by 17 donor countries. However, two
of the dono: countries were unabie to participate, and by
the end of 1978 the total of unquaitfied contribution commitments under ADF i} nad reached $7014 million, with ine
last $60 million of the United States contribution still to
come. This position was unchanged at ihe end of 1980."
Under the provisions of Resolution No. $2, as amended oy
Resolutions Nos. 103, 115 and 136, the Bank is authorized
to accept payment of this amount from the United Stazes
by the end of September 1981.

Arrangements for Lending from ADF

The arrangements for ADF lending were reviewed in October 1980. An account of the review ang its conciusions
may be found on cages 56 ana 57.

Resources and Utilization

At the Seginning of 1980 the net resources available for
concessional ioan commitments, after allowing a provision
for exchange rate fluctuations, was about $9 miliion, The
additional resources becoming available during the year
under ADF III amounted to $696 mil:ior. Individual cont ributions to ADF nave been made in the tational currencies of
the respective contributors. Depreciations anc appreciations during the year in the vaiues of some of the mayor contribuiors nationa: currencies against ihe United States
dollar resulted in a net increase of $131 mition ia ine total
value of contributed resources exoressed in terms of US
doliars. In addition, an amount of $31 million accrued to
ADF by way of net income.

At the end of 1980 total resources for concessional lending including contributed resources, Set-aside resources
anc net income stood at $2,916 milion, a net increase of
$851 million during the year.

New concessional joans approved during the year total
led $477 million, or $61 miliion more than in the previous
year. As of 31 December 1980, the cumulative amount of
concessional ioans (after allowing for exchange rate adjustments, cancellations and repayments) was $2,476
mitlion, leaving a balance of uncommitted resources at that
date of $440 million. After allowing for a provision against
exchange rate fluctuations, the net amount available for

further loan commitments stood at about $301 million.’ In
1980, disbursements under ADF resources amounted to
$350.3 million, bringing total cumulative disbursements to
$737.7 miilion. Repayments during the year and cumulative
fepayments up to the end of the year amounted to $10
mitlion and $30 million, respectively.

Income and Expenses

A substantial improvement in income from investments
of ADF resulted in a higher gross income of $49.9 million, or

31.4 per cent, over 1979. Although this was partly offset by
an increase in the Administration Charge to Special Operations, ADF realized a net income of $31,4 million, which includes net gain from changes in value of currencies amounting to $1.7 million. This is $10.7 million more than the $20.7
million net income for 1879.

MPSF incurred a net loss of $41,000 for the period from 1
January 1980 to 31 March 1980 due io changes in value of
currencies. This amount and the balance of Accrued
Resources amounting to $64,000 were transferred to ADF
when the Bank's adminisiration of MPSF was terminated
as of 31 March 1980.

Audit Committee of the Board

The Audit Committee of the Board held 17 formal

meetings in 1980 and submitted a special report and an annual report to the Board. The special report recommended
the appointment of outside auditors for 1981. The Committee’s annual report reviewed its activities in the period June
1979 to May 1980, with particular reference to internal and
external audit and post-evaluation, and recommended improvements in the work approach and programs of the
Post-Evatuation and Internal Auditor's Offices and in loan
implementation procedures. In addition, the Committee obtained for the Board's information the opinion of the outside auditors for 1980 on audit considerations related to
possible participation by the Bank in equity financing and
loan guarantees.

The Audit Committee was estabiished in 1977. The present Committee, comprising Mr, B.H. Kay (Chairman), Mr.
Rainer Goerdeler and Mr. A. Meicnor, Jr., was appointed in
June 1979 for a two-year term which wil! expire in May 1981,

 

85Committee on Administrative Matters Relating
to Members of the Board

The Committee on Administrative Matters Relating to
Members of the Board held two formal meetings in 1980
and submitted three reports to the Board.

Organization

The Bank’s efforts to strengthen tts economic research
capability were reflected in the appointment of a Chief
Economist to head the Economic Office, the steps initiated
to design long-term plans of economic research and
analysis and the proposed strengthening of staff engaged
in economic analysis in the Country Department. A number
of studies which will help improve understanding of
development problems and processes were initiated in
1980,

Owing to the increased activities and responsibilities of
the Advisor, Computer Services and his staff in terms of
developing and coordinating the Sank’s computerization
program, the Office of Computer Services was formed and
the position of Advisor, Computer Services previously attached to the Office of the Vice-President, Finance and Administration, was redesignated Chief, Office of Computer
Services.

Internal Audit

Internal auditing provides Management with periodic, independent and objective evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controis and related systems and
procedures, but has no direct responsibllity for developing

FRESH FISH at the dockside in Indonesta. The Bank Is supporting fisheries development In many DMCs in order to
raise Incomes, generate empioyment and increase the proteln levels in national diets.

 

and installing changes in such systems, procedures, and
internal controls. The Olfice of the Internal Auditor (OIA)
reports to the President and maintains regular liaison with
the Vice-President, Finance and Administration, and Audit
Committee of the Board. OIA assists al! levels of management in the effective discharge of activities within their
respective areas of responsibilities. Regular audit activities
are of the financial audit type and are geared towards giving appropriate audit attention to financial, administrative
and other Bank activities, but, more recently, greater attention has been paid to such aspects of the Bank's work as
efficiency and policy by conducting brief surveys in potentially critical areas. Reports on such surveys are conveyed
to appropriate parties in the same manner as special audit
reports (see below).

Special audits involve in-depth examination of particular
activities and subjects relating to the Bank’s financial administration. Though many criteria determine the selection
of topics for special audits, there has been a tendency for
special audits to concentrate on problem areas of the day.
The results of each special audit, comprising findings,
analyses, conclusions and recommendations, are conveyed to Management and departments concerned by
separate report, for information and action as appropriate.
Copies of such special audit reports are also conveyed to
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, who may
review such reports with the Internal Auditor and/or
representatives of departmenis concerned.

Consultations with other Bank departments include
OlA's early involvement in the Bank’s computerization and
safeguarding Bank assets from losses. OIA also assists
and coordinates with the external auditors when the latter
conduct examinations of the Bank's accounts and financial
statements.

Computer Program

In March 1980, the Office of Computer Services was formed to undertake the Bank's computer program and considerable prograss has been made in a number of areas to
meet the Bank’s long-term data processing requirements.
Systems analysis and design have been performed for the
major applications in lending operations, accounting and
finance, administrative management and project monitoring. In December 1980, acquisition arrangements were
finalized for computer hardware, software and services and
the computer system is expected io be installed in early
1981.

During the year, a number of applications were implemented satisfactorily on a mini-computer and a microprocessor. In-house Electronic Data Processing (EDP) concépts and orientation courses were developed and a
number of training sessions were organized for seniof staff
during 1980. Training courses in systems design, data base
management systems, structured programming and on-line
applications design were conducted for EDP staff.

Systems analysis, design and program implementation
tasks will continue during 1981 for other applications, such
as administrative expenses commitment and accounting
systems, manpower planning, financial projections, currency management, consultants’ data, project planning and
monitoring, socio-economic data bank and word processing and retrieval systems. Training sessions will also be artanged for staff in each user department and office in data
entry, data control and data access procedures,CHEMIST at work in a laboratory at the National Industria! Research institute in the Republic of Korea, part of the Bankassisted industria! Products Inspection Centers Project which aims to develop and maintain internationally acceptable standards for the country's industrial products.

Office Accommodation

During the year, congestion in the Headquarters building
was relieved, to some extent, by the transier of a major part
of the Budget, Persannei and Management Systems
Department to the Marbella I building located close to the
Bank. The planned transter of selected departments and offices to the new Marbella f1 building, which is also located
in the vicinity of the Bank, did not take place due to delays
in the compietion of the building.

In March 1980, the Board of Directors agreed in general
terms with a proposal to construct a new Headquarters
building in the Financial Center on the Manila Bay
Reclamation Area under arrangements to be agreed upon
between the Bank and the Philippine Government, on the
understanding that a detailed project appraisal will be submitted to the Board.

Building Safety Improvements

In view of the plan to relocate the Bank in a new Headquarters building within a few years, a reduced program of
safety improvements to the present Headquarters building,
covering essential work to be undertaken by the Philippine
Government in early 1981, has been prepared. Further safety improvements to the Headquarters building were also
implemented during the year as part of the building
maintenance program.

Staff Housing Scheme

The Bank’s rental assistance program was adjusted during the year in order to help expatriate staff meet ihe dif
ficulties they face in obtaining suiiabie accommodation at
reasonable cost. A consultant was also engaged to assist
in the preparation of a Bank-financed pilot housing
scheme.

Staff

On 31 December 1980, the Bank's staff had reached a
total of 1,147 from 33 member countries. Of these, 416
belonged to the professional staff category and 731 were
supporting staff. There were 94 professional staff appointments during the year — the highest number in any single
year so far — while 38 staff terminated their employment
with the Bank. In the supporting staff category, 127 appointments were made and 43 staff resigned.

The annual review of staff salaries and benefits was conducted in the second half of the year. In order to keep staff
salaries in line with the rising cost of living and in order to
maintain the competitiveness of Bank compensation vis-avis comparable organizations, the Board of Directors approved general salary increases for professional and supporting staff, effective 1 August, as well as a number of improvements in staff benefits.

During 1980, the Bank formuiated a new comprehensive
personnel management policy which will serve as a
blueprint for future activities in this important area. The
Board approved a new salary system for supporting staff in
connection with the introduction in August 1980 of a Position Classification Program. A comprehensive review of the
compensation system ‘or professional staff was similarly
initiated with the assistance of qualified consultants. During the secong half of 1980, work was mainly concentrated

 

8788

on the position classification phase of this review. Programs have also been initiated to establish a comprehensive manpower planning and career development system.

A Supplementary Budget for Internal Administrative Expenses for 1980 in the amount of $965,400 was authorized
by the Board of Directors on 17 December 1980, mainly to
provide for the costs of the general salary increase and
benefit improvements approved during the year. This revised the original budget from $42,372,000 to $43,337,400. Actual administrative expenses for 1980 totalied $42,619,604,
representing 98.3 per cent utilization of ihe revised budget.

The approved Budget for 1981 is summarized in Appendix
2, It provides for Internal Administrative Expenses in 1981
amounting to $58,746,000, an increase of $16.1 million over
actual expenses in 1980. This increase is largely attributable to: (i} additional staff; (ii) salary and benefit im

their output.

 

provements approved in 1980; (iii) increased consultants’
services and business travel required for the Bank's work in
1981; {iv) higher volume in office occupancy, communica:
tions, equipment, supplies, and other overheads required to
Support the Bank’s functions; and (v) past and prospective
price escalation. :

lt was recognized that the high rate of budget increase
was a matter for concern. In this respect, maximum efforts
would be exerted in the implementation of the budget to effect possible economies and to improve budgetary processes and controls.

In addition, provision is made under Services to Member
Countries for new Commitments and Disbursements in
1981 amounting to $11,000,000 and $9,573,000, representing increases of 31.5 per cent and 51.2 per cent over actual
commitments and disbursements in 1980, respectively. The
increases in both commitments and disbursements in 1981
are due to the higher volume of technical assistance to be
processed for approval and those under implementation.STATISTICAL ANNEX

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK — ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1980 and 31 December 1979

 

referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Bank has
for purposes of these financial statements express:
96 the value of its capital stock in terms of the SDR,
on the basis that each share has the value of SDR
10,000. For purposes of ihese financial statements, it
has also measured the mutual obligations of each
member and of the Bank with respeci to
maintenance of value of currency holdings by that
standard, However, the appropriate authorities of the
Bank could decide that the value of each share
should be fixed at $12,083.50, on the basis of a
substitution of 1.20635 current United States dollars
for each 1966 dollar.

When the SDR was introduced Into the IMF Articles
in 1968, tt was expressed in terms of a speclfled
weight of goid equal to the gold content of the 1966
dollar. Since 1 July 1974, its value has been based on
the weighted relative values of a number of major
currencies {a ‘currency basket”). On 7 July 1974, the
value of the SDR, expressed In terms of United States
dollars was $1.20635, namely the same value as the
1966 doliar, but subsequently the value in current
monetary terms has varied from day to day. Effective
1 July 1978, the IMF made certain adjustments in the
SDR currency basket, and established a method for
further adjustments at five-yearly intervals, to reflect
changes in the relative importance of currencies over
time, while ensuring continuity and reasonable
predictability for the valuation of the SDR. The IMF
further revised the currency basket effective 4
January 1981 by reducing the number of currencies
from 16 to 5. The adjustments made-at the time of the
changes are such that the value of the revised
baskets in terms of any currency was exactly the
same under both the then existing and the revised
valuations. As of 31 December 1980, the value of the
SDR in terms of the United States dollar was
$1.27541, giving a value for each share of the Bank's
capital equivalent to $12,754.10,

The substitution of the SDR rather than $1.20635 in
current United States dollars for the 1966 dollar does
not have a material effect on the financial position or
results of operations of the Bank. If the capital stock

as of 31 December 1980 had been valued in terms of
$12,083.50 per share, the “callable" capital subscribed would have been $6,700,092,000
{$6,488,233,000—1979) instead of $7,083,653,000
($7,085,128,000—1979) the “paid-in” capital subscribed would have been $1,649,949,000
($1,626,389,000—1979} instead of $1,744,403,000
{$1,776,011,000—1979}, the total subscribed capital
would have been $8,360,041,000 ($8,114,622,000 —
1979) instead of $8,828,056,000 ($8,861,139,000
—1979) and maintenance of value obligations would
have been $9,488,000 payabie te members instead of
$64,497,000 receivable from members ($5,467,000
recelvable from members instead of $113,273,000
receivable from members — 1979).

As of 31 December 1980, all matured instalments
amounting to $1,626,948,000 ($1,552,319,000 — 1979)
were recelved except $374,000 due. from two
members ($812,000 due from three members — 1979).
Instalmenis not die aggregating $117,455,000
{$223,692,000 — 1979) are receivable as follows:

the Board of Directors who elect to join the Plan. The
Staff Retirement Plan assets are segregated and
held in trust and are not included in the accompanying balance sheet.

From December 1974, each participant has conirfduted 9 1/3 per cent of his remuneration to the
Plan, and the Bank has contributed 48 2/3 per cent of
ihe participants’ remuneration. The Bank's contribu
tion is determined at a rate sufficient to cover that
part of the costs of the Plan not covered by the participants’ contributions. For the year ended 37
December 1980, the amount contributed by the Bank
was $3,414,000 ($2,647,000 — 1979).

The actuarial present value of vested and non-vesied

NOTE 1 —

NOTIONAL AMOUNTS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN VALUE
OF CURRENCY HOLDINGS

Prior to 1 April 1978, the Bank implemented
maintenance of value in respect of holdings of
member currencies In terms of 1966 dollars, in accor
dance with the provisions of Article 25 of its Articles

_ and refevant resolutions of the Board.of Directors. In
asmuch as the valuation of the Bank's capital stock
and the basis of determining possible maintenance
of value obligations after the effective date of the
Second Améndment to the IMF Articles are still
under consideration, notional amounts have been
calculated provisionally as receivable from or
payable to members in order to maintain the value of
currency holdings in terms of the SDR, The timing of
any establishment and settlement of such amounts
is uncertain. The notional amounts as of 31
Becember 1980, consisting of receivables of
$85,482,000 ($120,818,000 — 1979) and payables of
$22,571 ,000 ($9,141,000 — 1979} represent {a) the increase of $73,985,000 in amounts required to maintain the vatue of currency holdings to the extent of
matured and paid capital subscriptions due to the increase in the value of the SDR in relation to the

 

United States dollar, the Bank's unit of account, during the perlod 1 April 1978 to 31 December 1980, offset by(b) the net increase of $11,074,000 in the value
of such currency holdings in relation to the United
States doilar during the same period [(a) the increase
of $107,805,000 in amounts required to maintain the
value of currency holdings to the extent of matured
and paid capital subscriptions due to the increase in
the value of the SDR in relation to the United States
dollar during the period 1 April 1978 to 31 December
1979, and by (b) the net decrease of $3,872,000 in the
value of such currency holdings In relation to the
United States doliar during the same period].

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND
ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

Administrative expenses are net of Administration
Charge to Special Operations amounting to
$20,268,000 ($15,423,000 — 1979). The Administration
Charge to Special Opératlons was instituted in 1971.
It was based on a formula which took into consideratlon certain administrative expenses and the number
and amount of loans approved. Effective 1 January
1978, thie formula was revised to take into considera.
tion all administrative expenses (others than those appertaining directly to ordinary operations and special
operations} and the number of loans approved.

The outstanding conimitmients, as of 31 December
1980, for'tectinical assistance projects and programs
approved by. the Bank, were approximately
$12,670,000 ($11,844,000. — 1979); to the extent
available, contributions to the Technica! Assistance
Special Fund may be uséd to meét expenditures arislng out of the’ commitments. The amount shown is

Since 1967, the Bank has estabiisned Special Funds

Bank as provided in Article 19 of the Articles of
Agreement. Such Special Funds Resources consist
of a Technical Assistance Special Fund and a MuttiPurpose Special Fund.

tn 1974, the Asian Development Fund was established. Six contributors elected to have their contributions to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund made
after 31 December 1972 credited toward the amount
of their contributions to tne Asian Development
Fund. Accordingly, their contributions were transferred to the Asian Development Fund.

As a further step to streamline.and restructure the
Special Funds, transfer to the Asian Development
Fund of ‘the resources in the Multi-Purpose: Special
Fund was authorized in. 1975:.Accordingly,- ali. the

resources in--the Multi-Purpose Special Fund have 
since been transfered, to the Asian Development:

Resources and to certain other income derived from
Special Funds Resources credited, held and admolnistered by the Bank In the Multi-Purpose Special
Fund,

Pursuant to a Resolution adopted by the Board of
Directors, the amount representing accumulated net
Income and other credit of the Multi-Purpose Special
Fund as of 31 March 1980 was transferred to the
Asian Development Fund and the Bank’s administratlon of the Multi-Purpose Special Fund was terminated as of that date.

NOTE 5 —

LOANS

Loans ‘approved by the Bank on concessional terms
are classified as Special Funds loans. Where
necessary and when avallable, the resources of both
the Maulti- Purpose Special Fund and the Asian
Development Fund were used, prior to the termlna
‘tlon of the Bank's administration of the Multl

Purpose Special Fund on 31 March 1980, elther singly
or Jointly to finance such loans. The amounts shown
as “Effective.loans held by Bank” at’81 December

1979 represented only thé portions of loans outstand
ing which were.disbursed from the resources then reinaining ‘in the Multi-Purpose Special Fund.

NOTE 6—

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND
ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

The Administrative expenses for the year ended 31
December 1979 included Administration Charge to
Special Operations amounting to $47,000. The Ad
‘ministration Charge to Special Operations was in
 

stituted in 1971. It was based on a formula which
took into consideration certain administrative expenses and the number and amount of loans approved. Effective 1 January 1978, the formuia was
revised to take Into consideration al} administrative
expenses {other than those appertaining directly to
ordinary operations and special operations) and the
number of loans approved. Upon transfer of the bulk
of the resources to the Asian Develapment Fund [see
Notes i(b), and 1i(e)] the Administration Charge
Payable to Ordinary Capital Resources applicable to
such. resources and contributions was also transferred, resulting in a net credit arising from such
transfer of the liabillty.

NOTE 7 —

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

The outstanding commitments, as of 31 December
1980 for technical assistance projects and programs
approved by the Bank, were approximately
$12,670,000 ($11,844,000— 1979); to.the extent available, contributions to the Techniéal Assistance Spe¢lal Fund may be used to meet expenditures arising
out of the commitments, The amount shown:is excluslye of technical assistance services made

‘available on a reimbursable ‘basis; however, when

technical assistance rendered as a part of the commitment shown leads to leans for specific projects,
the portion representing the cost of design and
éngineéring and any balance of amount over
$160,000 will be <cofivertéed ‘to the subsequent loan.
Under such options, technical assistance expenditures of $148,000 ($183,000--1978) were charged to
loans and credited to in¢ome of Other Resources of
the Technical Assistance Special Fund during the
year ended 31 December 1980 (Mult!-Purpose Special

NOTE 3 —
SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

 

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph
i}, the Board of Governors has authorized the setting aside of 10 per. cent of the unimpaired “paid-in”
capital paid by members pursuant to Article 6,

paragraph’ 2(a) and the convertibte currenoy portion —

paid by memibers pursuant to Article 6, paragraph
2{b} as of 28 April 1973, to be used as part of the
Special Funds of ihe Bank. The capital so set aside
was allocated and transferred ‘from -the ordinary
capital resources to the Fund as Set-Aside
Resources.

The capital stock of the Bank is defined in Article 4,
paragraph 3 of the Articles of Agreement “in terms of
United States dollars of ihe weight ‘and fineness In

effect on 31 January 1966” (ihe 4966 dollar). ©

Therefore, Set-Asidé Resources had tiistorically been

-translated .inio the current United States doilar (the

Bank’s unit of account}, on the basis of Its par value
In tarms of gold. From 1973 until 31 March 1978, the
rate artlved at on this.basls was $1.20635 per 1986
doliar. Since 1, April 1978, at which time the Second
Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund {IMF} came into effect, currencies no longer have par values in terms of gold.
The Bank is examining ‘the implications of this
change on ‘the valuation of its capital stock but has
not made-a decision on the matter. Pénding such a

‘decision, the Set-Aside Resources has been valued

for purposes of the accompanylhg financial

statements In terms of the Special Drawing Right
(SDR), at the vaiue In current United States dollars as
computed by the IMF. As of 31 December 1980, the
SDR was valued at $1.27541. On this basis, Set-Aside
Resources amounted to $60,722,000. The substltutlon of the SDR rather than $4.20635 in current United
States doilars for the 1966 dollar does not have a
materlal effact on the financial position or results of
operations of the Fund, If the capital stock as of
31 December 1980 had been valued in terms of
$12,063.50 per share Set-Aside Resources would
have been $57,434,000.

NOTE 4 —

LOANS

Loans approved by the Bank on concessional terms
ara classified’ as Special Funds loans. Where
necessary and when avallable the resources of both
the Multi-Purpose Special Fund and the Fund were
used, prior to the termination of the Bank's Administration of the Mult+Purpose Special Fund on 31
March 1980, either singly or jointly to tinance such
loans. The portions of foans allocated to the MultiPurposé Special ‘Fund, representing disbursements

iN 1977 THE BANK maintained the rising tempo of its Jending and technical assistance activities, augmented its own capital resources and tapped important new sources of
development aid. Special efforts were made to help the poorest of its developing countries
(DMCs).

A detailed account of the Bank’s activities in 1977 appears later in the Report. Highlights are summarized below.

The Bank's capital resources were increased by 135 per cent — from $3,707 miltion to $8,711 million — with the coming into effect of the Second General Capital
Increase

Negotiations began with developed member countries for the second replenishment of the Asian Development Fund {ADF Ilf), to finance the Bank’s projected concessional lending program over the period 1979-1982

New loans approved from both ordinary capital and Special Funds resources totalled $887 million, an increase of 14.3 per cent on 1976

Total lending since 1968 passed the $4,000 million mark and cumulative disbursements reached $1,515 million

Technical assistance activities expanded sharply — 42 projects costing $7.2 million were approved, as against 24 projects costing $4.6 million in 1976; preparations were made for further expansion, designed especially to accelerate investment in DMCs and also to attract project financing from other sources

The Agriculture and Agto-Industry sector received 29 per cent of total lending and
nearly 60 per cent of concessional lending; the percentage shares of other sectors
were: Power — 25; Transport and Communications — 16; Industry (including
Development Banks} — 16; Water Supply and Urban Development — 12; and
Education — 2

ECONOMIC BACKGROUND

International Setting

DURING 1977 THE wortd.economy continued to recover,
although at a modest pace, from the severe recession experienced in 1974 and 1975. The overall growth in Gross
National Product (GNP) was substantially lower than that
attained in 1976. World trade increasedin volume by only 5

per cent, compared with 11 per cent in 1976. The results .

for the year were affected by the difficulties encountered by
many countries in reducing high rates of inflation and
unemployment, the generally depressed levels of investment, and serious imbalances in the external accounts of
major trading countries, leading to unstable exchange
rates.

On the other hand, the output of foodgrains was ata high
level for the third consecutive year; the worid stock’ af cereais increased from about 124 million metric tons (m.t.} in
4976 to about 160 million m.t. in 1977. As a result, the
global food situation has improved considerably since the
early 1970s, this has helped to contain inflationary pressures,

The aggregate GNP, in real terms, of the industrial couniries which are members of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation: and Development (OECD) is estimated to
have increased by 3.6 per cent in 1977, as against 5.2 per
cent in 1976. In several major industrial countries, inflation
and unemployment levels remained high, the policy
measures adopted to contain inflation generally affected
ihe pace of economic recovery. The aggregate current
account deficit of the OECD ccuntries during 1977
($32,000 million) was substantially larger than in 1976
{$26,500 million), Moreover, the distribution of the
increased deficit among these countries was more
uneven. Some OECD countries resorted to restrictions on
certain imports on grounds of severe external imbalances
and persisting unemployment.

The oil-exporting (OPEC) developing countries continued to sustain high levels of investment and fairly rapid
rates of economic growth in 1977, although some slowing
down occurred as several of these countries faced bottlenecks in implementing their expanding development programs. The aggregate current account surplus of the oilexporting countries declined marginally from $42,300 million in 1976 to about $40,000 million in 1977. This surplus
accrued largely to a few countries, whose capacity to
absorb imports remains comparatively small. On the other
hand, some of the more populous countries had to accept
sizeable current account deficits in supporting their

1 Tote: carryover of cereals (exctuding the People's Reoublic of China and
U.S.S.R,} estimated by the Food ang Agriculture Organization (FAQ).

development programs.

There are indications that most of the non-oil developing
countries were able to sustain fairly satisfactory rates of
increase in their GNP in 1977, although the aggregate rate
is likely to fall short of the 5.4 per cent rate achieved in
1976. This performance was accompanied by continuing
high current account deficits — $45,400 million in 1977
compared to $44,000 million in 1976." While the total foreign exchange reserves of the non-oil developing
countries continued to increase in 1977, the improvement
was largely accounted for by a few countries and was
made possible by inflows of capital which exceeded their
combined current account deficit.

The economic prospects for 1978 of the world economy
appear, on the whole, to be less promising than in the previous two years. Due to unfavorable weather, the production of foodgrains in the 1978 crop year? is expected
to be below the ievel attained in 1977. On the basis of the
policies and economic situation prevailing at the end of
1977, the oyerall growth rate of OECD countries for 1978
was forecast at3.5 per cent.? Unless higher rates of growth
are achieved by major industrial countries, nat only will
they continue to experierice unsatisfactory leveis of unemployment but also the growth of world trade will be
retarded, and many developing countries, especially those
that are highly export-oriented, will suffer as a result.
Increased restraints on imporis by industrial countries
could further affect exports of manufactured goods by developing countries, resulting in larger deficits in their external accounts. According to OECD estimates, the aggregate current account deficit of non-oil developing countries
is expected to increase substantially from $45,400 mittion
in 1977 to $59,006 million in 1978 — alevel which would be
difficult to sustain.

To maintain their growth momentum, the developing
countries will have to intensify their efforts to mobilize
higher domestic savings, exploit domestic natural resources, increase efficiency in industrial and agricultural
production and expand exports both of traditional and nontraditional items. The success of these efforts will greatly
depend upon the extent to which the major industrial countries reflate their economies, maintain growth in their imports from developing countries and also raise the level of
their external assistance.

LOGGING in Burma, where the Bank’s first Forestry

Project will contribute to better use of the country’s
timber resources,Economic Developments in the Region

in terms of severa! majos indicators, such as growth in
real incomes, food production, export earnings and foreign
exchange reserves, the economic performance in 1977 of
the developing member countries {DMCs} of the Bank, on
the whole, gave cause for satisfaction. However, jower
rates of growth in GNP were experienced by many DMCs,
largely because the sharp rate of increase in production
achieved in 1976, particuiarly in industry, was not sustained in 1977. Also, inflation rates, which had abated considerably in 1978, generally moved upward during 1977.

On the basis of preliminary estimates tor 13 DMCs listed
in Table 1,’ it seems that rates of growth In reat Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) were generally satisfactory in
1977. In Burma, Fiji, Singapore and Sri Lanka the rates improved from 6 per cent, 2.6 per cent, 6.8 per cent and 3 per
centin 1976 to 6.6 per cent, 4 per cent, 7.5 percent and 4.5
per cent, respectively, in 1977. Ih each of these countries,
a general improvement occurred in ail major economic
sectors. In Indonesia, despite its poor performance in the
agricultural sector, the rate remained steady at around 7
per cent. In the Philippines the rate declined from 7.3 per
cent in 1976 to 5.8 per cent in 1977, reflecting slower
growth in agriculture, manufacturing and construction activities and continued low prices for some important export

products. in Thailand also the rate declined from 8.2 per
cent in 1976 to 6.2 per cent in 1977. in most of the more
industrialized and economically advanced DMCs' —
Republic of China, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea and
Mataysia — there was a decline. However, GDP growth
tates for this group ranged from 7.7 per cent to 11.6 per
cent, Though impressive by international standards, these
were below the high rates achieved in 1976 when the
region as a whole benefited from the sharp recovery of the
world economy from the relatively depressed conditions
prevailing in 1975.

Bangladesh and Pakistan experienced considerably
lower growth rates during 1977. In Bangladesh, agricultural production, on which the economy is heavily dependent, felt somewhat from the level achieved in 1976. As a
result, the overail growth rate declined, despite improved
performance in the non-agricultural sectors. In Pakistan,
manufacturing output declined sfightly in 1977, as ithad in
the previous two years, due mainly to a deterioration in the
business climate and shortages of raw materials, including
cotton, Moreover, heavy losses oceurredin the agricultural
sector due to severe ficods. As a result, the overall growth
rate in 1877 was negligiole.

Of the DMCs for which national income data for 1977 are
not yet available, production statistics for certain major
sectors suggest that India may have achieved an increase
in real income of around 5 per cent, which is much higher
than that for 1976, due to a bumper food crop and growihin
production in other sectors, The growth rate of Nepal is
expected to remain more or less at the 4 per cent level
achieved in 1976. In Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam,
floods and prolonged droughi seriously affected their agricultural production and, consequently, their overall GDP
growth rates must have suffered. In respect of the Pacific
countries, the information available on production and
international prices of their principal exports indicates that
they achieved a moderate growth in real income during
1977, with the exception of Giibert Islands, which was
affected by reduced prices for its principal export
{phosphate}.

Overall agricultural production in the region in 1977
showed a substantial improvement over 1976. However,
the performance of individual DMCs varied widely. Some
of the predominantly agricultural countries (Bangladesh,
Lao Peapie’s Democratic Republic and Socialist Repubtic
of Viet Nam) experienced unfavorable weather, which
resulted in reduced output. However, in many other DMCs
(Republic of China, India, Republic of Korea, Malaysia
and Nepal), agricultural production increased, due both to
favorable weather and continued improvements in development efforts in this sector.

During 1975-1977 considerable gains were made in
food security. Production of foodgrains (rice, wheat and
maize) in the region declined marginally from the record
level of 222 million m.t. achieved in 1975 to 218 million m.t.
in 1976. For 1977 a new record of 231 miflion m,t. has been
estimated — 6 per cent more than in 1976 (Tables 2 and
3)? As a result, food stocks in many countries have
reached high tevels. For the DMCs as a whole, food im

posts fell from 20.7 million m.t. in 1976 to 19.2 million m.t. in
1977, of which an increased proportion was met from
surpluses within the region.

Among the foodgrains, the greatest gain was made in
the output of rice, the staple food of the majority of the population in the region. Total rice production in the DMCs
increased trom 158 million m.t. in 1976 to 172 million m.t. in
1977, exceeding the previous record of 168 million m.t. set
in 1975. Wheat production also was at a record level —
about 42 million m.t. Maize productién, which declined in
1976, faited to improve in 4977.

Preliminary data for ten DMCs, including most of the
more industrialized countries, reveal that, with the exception of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, the expansion in industrial production slowed down in 1977. The deceleration in
growth rates was very sharp in the Republic of China (from
24.9 per cent in 1976 to 11.2 per cent in 1977}, India
(from 10.9 per cent to 5.8 per cent), the Republic of Korea
(from 33.2 per cent to 14.1 per cent) and the Philippines
(from 4.9 per cent to 3.3 per cent). This deterioration was
due largely to sluggishness in domestic demand and a
slowing down in the growth of exports to industrial
countries. Restraints on exports of textiles was ah important factor in the latter regard. New investment in manufacturing industries also remained generally depressed
during the year.

Within the industrial sector, however, production of fossil
fuels made significant gains. The output of crude petrofeum in five DMCs (Burma, India, Indonesia, Malay
sia and Pakistan) increased by 11.8 per cent from 92.1
million m.t. in 1976 to 103 million m.t. in 1977. Even excluding Indonesia (which is a member of OPEC) the increase
was 10.5 per cent — from 18.1 million m.t. in 1976 to 20
million m.t. in 1977. Production of natural gas also
increased substantially during the year — mostly in indonesia, which is the major producer of natural gas in the
region.

The DMCs succeeded, on average, in containing inflation in 1977 to about the same rate asin the previous year
(Table 4). Excluding India, which has a very large relative
weighting and which experienced considerable swings in
price movements in each of the past three years, the
weighted average rate of consumer price increases in 21
DMCs fell from 13.5 per cent in 1975 to 8.4 per centin 1976
and to 8 per cent in 1977. This overall performance was
much better than in the developing world as a whole and
was about the same as the average rate of inflation in
OECD countsies in 1977. Price changes experienced by
India during the same period were 6.6 per cent in 1975,
minus 7.7 per cent in 1976 and 8.5 per cent in 1977.

While the average rate of inflation was slightly less than
in 1976, the number of countries which experienced higher
inflation in 1977 was much greater than the number which
experienced the reverse (Table 4}, The causes of inflationary pressures varied from country to country. In those
industrialized DMCs which experienced higher price increases, the boostin monetary demand came largely from
increases in international reserves and expansionaryfinancial policies pursued to sustain the rate of growth in
GNP. The higher rate of inflation in some of the agricultural
DMCs was mainly attributable to shortages due to poor
performance of the agricultural sector. A general factor
exerting upward pressure on prices in all DMCs was the
continued high rate of inflation in the world economy. Any
further major improvement in the situation in the region in
this regard wilf therefore depend on greater price stabilization in world markets.

In the sphere of international trade, the aggregate merchandise trade deficit of the DMCs substantiaily increased
from $5,000 million in 1976 to $5,700 million in 1977, The
data on exports, imports and trade balances givenin Table
5 show that some countries experienced a substantial improvement over 1976. Important among these countries
were the Republic of Korea, the Philippines and Singapore, all of which experienced considerably reduced trade
deficits in 1977; the Republic of China, whose trade surplus increased; and india, whose previous small trade deficit was converted into a surplus. However, these improvements were more than offset by larger trade deficits (or
reduced surpluses} recorded by several other DMCs.
Notable among the countries which increased their deficits
in 1977 were Hong Kong, whose deficit more than dou-~
bied; Thailand, whose deficit nearly doubled; and Pakistan, whose large trade deficit increased further to a record
level of $1,300 million. Among the surplus countries, Indonesia’s favorable balance was reduced by almost

two-thirds, while Malaysia also experienced a substantial
reduction in its trade surplus.

It may be noted that the four more industrialized DMCs
and India reduced their aggregate trade deficit from $3,000
tmiilion in 1976 to $2,000 million in 1977 (Table 5}. On the
other hand, the remaining DMCs experienced a deterioration of $1,700 million in their balance of trade — their
overall deficit increasing from $2,000 million in 1976 to
$3,700 million in 1977. For the four more industrialized
OMCs and India, exports — particularly of manufactured
goods — increased at a much faster rate than imports; for
the remaining DMCs, export performance failed to keep
pace with the growth in imports.

Overall, exports of DMCs increased in value by about
49.5 per cent in 1877. Although below the level achieved in
1876 (34 per cen), this was higher than the aggregate
growth in world exports (estimated at 11 per ceni). it was
made possible by both an improvement in the unit prices of
major export items and higher export volumes. This
enabled the DMCs to provide for their import requirements
somewhat more liberally than in the past. Aggregate imports increased by 19 per cent in 1977, as compared with
41 per centin 1976. This was also substantially higher than
the growth in world imports, reflecting the growing share of
DMCs in world trade.

Data on the direction of trade flows of DMCsin 1976, the
Jatest year for which such figures are avaiiabie, show that

1976 E__j 1977the United States, Japan and Western Europe were the
largest export markets, absorbing 24.3 per cent, 19.1 per
cent and 18.7 per cent, respectively, of the exports from
DMCs. These three markets were also the most important
sources of imports, accounting for 16.9 per cent, 23.2 per
cent and 15.7 per cent, respectively, of DMCs’ total imports. intra-regional trade was nextin importance, absorbing 17.2 per cent of the region's exports arid supplying
15.4 per cent of its imports in 1976. The only major development in the direction of trade in recent years has been
the emergence of the Middle East countries as trading
partners. Imports from these countries increased from 5.4
per cent of the total imports of DMCs in 1972 to 14 per cent
in 1976; DMC exports to these countries increased similarly from 2.6 per cent of their total exports in 1972 to S.6 per
cent in 1976. Over the same period several DMCs,
including india, the Republic of Korea, Pakistan and the
Philippines benefited from a substantial increase in remittances from their nationals working in Middle East
countries.

Indices of the terms of trade in 1977, available for eight
DMCs, show animprovement for four countries, a deterioration for three, and no change for one country. For several
countries, the terms of trade, with 1972 as the base year,
remained at very low levels during 1977. For Bangladesh,
the index stood at 53 — the same as in 1976. For the Republic of China, the index declined from 90 in 1976 to 86in
1977. For the Philippines, the index has deteriorated every
year since 1974, standing at 71 in 1977. For the Republic
of Korea, the index rose, but was still only 83 in 1977. lmprovements over the base year occurred only for Malaysia,
Pakistan and Singapore; their indices in 1977 reaching
114, 102 and 105, respectively.

The aggregate international reserves of the DMCs continued to increase during 1977, although at a somewhat
slower rate than in 1976. Data available for 19 OMCs
{Table 6} show that their combined reserves increased
from $20,300 million at the end of 1976 to $25,800 million
by November/December 1977. Aggregate reserves rose
from the equivalent of 3.4 months’ imports in 1975 to 4.6
months’ imports in 1976 and again to 4.9 months’ imports
in 1977. However, most of this increase was experienced
by five DMCs — India, indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Singapore. Of the rest, some had to draw down
their reserves to meet their current deficits while for others
the gain in reserves was modest.

Despite the DMCs’ success in containing the level of
their trade deficits in 1976 and 19877 much below the high
levels prevailing in 1974 and 1975, external debt seems to
have continued to grow at a rapid pace. The data
presented in Table 7 show that, for 17 DMCs," total public
debt outstanding increased by 19 per cent — from $33,400
million to $39,700 million — between 1974 and 1975, and
by a further 18 per cent to $46,900 million in 1976.
Although no comprehensive data are available for 1977,
there are indications that the external public debt of DMCs
might have increased by about the same amount as in
1976. Debt-service payments in 1976 (the latest year for
which data are available) were higher than in 1975. However, due to increased exports, the aggregate debt-service
ratio, on the whole, declined from 6.2 per cent in 1975 to
5.9 per cent in 1976 (Table 7).

Domestic Efforts and Policies

The satisfactory economic performance recorded, by
many DMCs in recent years is largely attributable to the
pragmatic responses of the governments concerned to the
changed international economic situation resulting from
the events of the mid-1970s. In 1975 most DMCs sustained their growth targets, even though this invoived
sharp increases in external deficits and domestic price
levels. The expansionary economic policies pursued at
that time contributed in a modest way to cushioning the
severity of the international recession. In 1976, as the
recovery of the world economy began to exert expansionary impulses on their exports and economic growth,
the DMCs adopted stabilization measures which, on
the whole, were successtul in curtailing inflation and
sustaining relatively high GNP growth rates, as well as in
reducing their trade deficits. In 1977, in view of the slowdown in international economic recovery, several DMCs
resorted to expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to
sustain their economic growth, while generally keeping intlation rates within manageable limits. Towards this end, a
number of governments increased taxes and/or reduced
subsidies and also adopted selective credit policies.
Nevertheless, many DMCs continued to suffer from inadequate domestic savings to finance their investment programs.

The DMCs generally continued to pursue policies designed to realize the objective of increasing self-reliance.
In respect of socio-economic priorities, more attention
was devoted to rural development, the narrowing of regional imbalances and the encouragement of production to
meet basic human needs. The emphasis placed on
increasing production of foodgrains was maintained, since
in the past imports of foodgrains had accounted for the
major drain on foreign exchange resources of many — and
in particular the poorer — DMCs. The record level of
foodgrains production in the region in 1977, despite adverse weather in some countries, attests to the vigorous
efforts being made by DMCs to improve agricultural
productivity.

The need to reduce the incidence of urban unemployment and rural underemployment, while economizing on
the use of capital resources, led the more populous DMCs
to search for effective methods of promoting small-scale
industries and development projects employing indigenous technologies because of their valuable impact on
employment generation. Efforts to develop indigenous
energy resources were also intensified. In several DMCs
family planning measures received added emphasis,
including budgetary allocations.

During the year several DMCs undertook measures designed to make their exports more competitive to stimulate private investment and to attract farger foreign capital
inflows through the adoption of realistic exchange rates
and the provision of fiscal and other incentives. A greater
emphasis on liberal trade policies aimed at the expansion
of both exports and imports was perceptible in public pronouncements, as well as in the policy changes made in @
number of DMCs. The relatively good export performance
and the availability of external resources to finance current
account deficits helped in the adoption of such policies.

Regional Cooperation
During 1977 several initiatives were taken to foster bila-10

teral and multiiateral economic cooperation among DMCs.
Members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) granted tariff concessions on a large number of
items in intra-regional trade. A swap facility of $100 million
was ratified by ASEAN members in August to help bridge
temporary international liquidity problems. Further progress was made during the year towards integrating the
economic infrastructure of ASEAN countries, notable
among which was the allocation of certain major industries
on the basis of regional specialization. Discussions were
also held on the establishment of a regional shipping service and a pooling of expertise in port services and
management.

The Asian Clearing Union, established in November
1975, handied an appreciably highér volume of transactions in 1977, amounting to 68 million Asian Monetary
Units (AMU) as compared to 22.6 milion AMU in 1976. It
was also decided to extend the settlement period for
unpaid balances accumulated by participating countries
from one month to two months. Progress was made with

PUSRI ii fertilizer plant near Paiembang, South Sumatra,
indonesia, where production of urea has been expanded from
100,000 tons to 480,000 tans annually with Bank assistance.

 

respect to the establishment of institutions under the sponsorship of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific (ESCAP}, such as a Regional Centre for
the Development of Indigenous Technology in Asia and
the Asian institute for Broadcasting Development, in which
most DMCs will participate.

South Asian countries took further steps to improve cooperation in that sub-region. An important development
was the treaty between India and Bangladesh on the sharing of the waters of the River Ganges. india and Nepal
agreed to strengthen their economic cooperation and
decided to execute expeditiously several projects in order
to exploit for their mutual benefit the water resources of
four major rivers flowing from Nepal to India. They aiso
agreed to execute appropriate trade and transit treaties
Trade relations between india and Pakistan continued to
improve during the year.

Significant developments occurred in 1977 in cooperation among the Pacific countries. Through the efforts of the
South Pacific Bureau for Economic Cooperation — the
economic arm of the South Pacific Forum (SPF} — anc the
South Pacific Commission, eight countries entered into an
agreement in June to explore the possibility of establishing
a regional shipping line. in August the SPF decided to establish a South Pacific Regional Fishing Agency for controlling the expicitation of fishery resources. All DMCs in
the Pacific are participating in these two cooperative
arrangements.

Developments in International Cooperation

Between 1974 (when the current deficits of DMCs
surged upward) and 1976 there was a steady increase in
the flow of external resources’ to the region, from $10,000
million in 1974 to $14,300 million in 1976 (Table 8). Most of
this increase was in non-concessional official and private
capital inflows. Concessionai aid inflows actually registered a decline. Official Development Assistance (ODA)
from the Development Assistance Committee (DAC)
countries and multilateral institutions combined, which increased from $4,800 million in 1974 to $5,300 miffion in
1975, declined to $4,400 million in 1976. This has particularly affected the poorer countries, which cannot afford
the alternative of borrowing at market terms.

No firm estimates of the total flow of external resources
to the region during 1977 are yei available. However, a
rough estimate based on data relating to trade deficits,
preliminary figures of net receipts from services and
private transfers, and movements in international reserves, suggests that net capital inflows in 1977 may have
been at the level of 1976. While net official assistance is
expected to be higher than in 1976, there was an offsetting
decline in private export credits, bond issues and Eurocurrency credits,

Several important measures were initiated during 1977
which either have contributed to increasing the availability
of external resources to DMCs or will assist in doing so in
future. First, the international Fund for Agricultural Development ({FAD), which has an initia! capital of approximately $1,000 million, became operational. by the end of the
year. Its primary objective is to help developing countries

1 Other than the flow from centrally planned economies, for which complete data
are not available.increase their food production. The poorest food-deficit
developing countries will be eligible for “special loans”
from IFAD which will carry a service charge of 1 per cent
per annum and be repayable over 50 years, Second, the
Trust Fund established by the IMF in May 1976 from the
proceeds of its gold auctions commenced operations. The
Fund wili be used to provide special balance-of-payments
support for eligible developing countries on‘concessional
terms. Third, a temporary Supplementary Financing
Facility amounting to $10,000 million was created by the
iMF to help member countries meet their urgent
balance-of-payments needs. Fourth, the Fifth Replenishment of the International Development Association ({DA
V}, amounting to $7,600 million for the three-year period
4977/78 to 1979/80, was approved by member countries
of the World Bank, This will enable IDA to increase
considerably its concessional lending, of which the DMCs
of the Bank can expect to receive a substantial share.

During the year developing countries continued to place
great emphasis on efforts to stabilize commodity prices, to
improve access to worid markets, to diversify and expand
the loca! processing of primary commodities, and to modernize the marketing and distribution systems for such
goods, with a view to expanding merchandise trade in
order to stimutate economic growth.

At the final Ministerial-level Meeting of the Conference
on International Economic Cooperation (C!IEC} held in
Paris in May-June 1977, while severa! issues remained
unresolved, there were also some concrete results. The
industrial countries agreed to a $1,000 million Special
Action Program to meet the needs of the poorest developing countries. Agreement in principle was aiso reached on
the establishment.of a Common Raw Materials Fund with
further negotiations on modalities to take place in the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
Meanwhife, several existing specific commodity arrangements (e.g., wheat, tin, sugar, coffee and cocoa)
are helping to improve the operations of commodity
markets for the benefit of both developing and developed
countries.

On the initiative of the World Bank, a new Internationat
Commission on Development Issues was set up under the
chairmanship of former Chancellor Willy Brandt of the Federal Republic of Germany to consider the major international issues confronting the world today, including
those discussed by CIEC, and to suggest solutions which
may be of long-run interest and benefit to both developed
and developing countries. Several eminent Asians are
included among the 16 members of the Commission
chosen by the Chairman.

There was further progress during the year in the development of an action program to eradicate world hunger. in
June, the United Nations World Food Council approved a
22-point International Action Program to solve the problem
of world hunger and mainutrition. This called for, among
other things, a substantial increase in economic assis
tance to expand food production in developing countries,
and the establishment of an international food reserve
system for wheat and possibly other foodgrains, including
rice. Follow-up action on such a world food program will
have a significant impact on the eradication of hunger and
malnutrition, the incidence of which still remains heavily
concentrated in DMCs of the Bank.

A central problem of development facing DMCs is that
the vast majority of their population live in “absolute
poverty”. The Declaration on Relations with Developing
Countries adopted by OECD member governments in
June acknowledged the necessity to continue working
towards improved and more effective development cooperation policies aimed at fostering growth in incomes
and meeting basic human needs in developing countries.
in particular, these governments expressed their determination to assist developing countries which seek to
expand their own capabilities to meet more effectively the
basic needs of their people, within the context of achieving
self-sustaining growth.

The Bank remained responsive to the varied and changing requirements of its DMCs and expanded subsiantially
both the size and range of its loan andtechnical assistance
operations during 1977. Particular attention was devoted
to efforts to promote an increased flow of official development assistance to the region. For this purpose, the
Bank, in addition to maintaining and expanding ‘existing arrangements, entered into new cooperative and
co-financing agreements with the EEC and the OPEC
Special Fund, and made considerable progress in arriving
at similar arrangements with IFAD.

The amount of concessional tending by the Bank to
poorer countries increased substantially in 1977, and within tt the already high share of loans for agriculture and
agro-industries was further increased. Special emphasis
was given to integrated rural development projects, which
aimed at directly reaching the marginal farmers and the
rural poor, and to the creation of additional non-farm rurat
employment opportunities. This emphasis accords with
the recommendations in the Second Asian Agricultural
Survey‘ undertaken by the Bank. The use of appropriate
technology and income and employment aspects were
given careful consideration in the selection and formulation of projects. The search for innovative and challenging projects led the Bank into new areas of activity.
Measures aimed at furthering local institution- building and
improving the project implementation capabilities of DMCs
through an expanded technical assistance program were
introduced.

During the year the Bank's Second General Capital !ncrease became effective and initial steps were taken in the
mobilization of additional Special Funds resources to
enable the Sank to carry out its concessional lending
program in future. These, and other efforts, are dealt with
in subsequent chapters of this Report.

ahOPERATIONS AND POLICIES

Lending Operations

THE BANK achieved steady growth inits assistance to the
region in 1977. Project loans totalled $887 million, nearly
one-third of which was on concessional terms to the poorer
countries. Significant advances were made in co-financing
and in cooperation generally with other aid agencies.
Technical assistance expanded sharply, much of it designed to increase the capacity of the poorer countries to
accelerate their development efforts. Special attention
was given to improving loan implementation and to
strengthening the social impact of project loans.

A total of 45 loans for 45 projects in 16 developing member countries (DMCs) was approved during the year,
compared to 37 loans for 36 projects in 16 DMCs in 1976.
At $887 million, totat lending represented an increase of
14.3 per cent’ over the previous year’s total of $776 million.

Loans from ordinary capital resources amounted to

$615 million, an increase of 13.9 per cent over the 1976

total of $540 million.

Despite uncertainties about the availability of resources,
Special Funds loans amounted to $272 million, an
increase of 15.3 per cent over the 1976 total of $236
million, and 96 per cent of this amount wentto DMCs with a
1975 per capita GNP of less than $200.

Seven DMCs received loans exclusively from ordinary
capital resources, namely, Hong Kong ($20.5 million),
Indonesia ($136 million), Republic of Korea ($135.2 million}, Malaysia ($43.3 million), Papua New Guinea ($17.7
milion}, Philippines ($147 million) and Thailand ($47
million).

Eight DMCs received loans exclusively from Special
Funds, namely, Afghanistan ($14.7 million), Bangladesh
($84.8 million), Burma ($25.1 million), Nepal ($23.5 million), Solomon Islands ($5.6 million}, Sti Lanka ($41.5 miloe Tonga ($370,000) and Western Samoa ($5.3 miiion).

Pakistan received loans totalling $139 million from both
ordinary capital resources ($68 million) and Special Funds
($71 miltion).

The Bank continued to pay special attention to its small
Pacific Island DMCs, which received a record number of

JUTE mill in Nepal, one of several being modernized

seven loans totafling $29 million during the year. Five of
these loans were from Special Funds and four were also
formulated under technical assistance previously provided
by the Bank. Special attention was given to supporting
efforts to expand productive capacity, both export-oriented
and import-substitutive, and to the extension andimprovement of economic infrastructure. The total of Bank loans to
OMCs in this sub-region now totals 24 for $91 million.

Loan approvals during the year inciuded four supplementary loans totalling $69.4 million.’ Two of these loans,
trom ordinary capital resources and amounting to $61 million, went to Indonesia ($23 million) and Pakistan ($38 million}, while two from Special Funds {totalling $8.4 million)
went to Nepal. One technical assistance loan, for $1.7 million, was approved for a feasibility study and preparation of
detailed designs and tender documents for the expansion
of a large power generation plantin the Republic of Korea.

The average size of loans approved in 1977 decreased
slightly to $19.7 million, or $20.4 million if the supplementary and engineering foans are excluded, compared to $21
million and $23.6 million, respectively, in 1976. The decrease was due to the approval of 12 smalter loans totalling $49.5 million from Special Funds to Afghanistan,
Nepal, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Western Samoa. The
smatlest loan for the year was $370,000 trom Special
Funds for the Smail Industries Center Project in Tonga; the
largest was $47 million from ordinary capital resources for

the Third Power Project in Thailand. The largest Special .

Funds loan was $39.5 million for the Faisalabad Water
Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Project in Pakistan.

The total cost of projects approved in 1977, excluding
development finance institution (DFI) projects, is estimated at $1,738 million, of which Bank financing accounted
for 46 per cent. The subloans in the three loans to DFls
have not yet been’ fully identified, but on the Bank's past
experience, the total costs of the projects financed by
these three loans could be expected to reach about $395
million.

By the end of the year the Bank’s cumulative tending had
reached $4,246 million for 309 projects in 23 DMCs. Of
this, loans totalling $3,079 million were made from ordinary

social benefit from its project loans, especially in the agricultural sector, where many opportunities exist for applying labor-intensive methods.

Following the completion of a review of its methodologies for economic and financial appraisal, social costbenefit and social equity analyses are being gradually
introduced into appraisals for Bank-assisted projects,
initially on a selective and experimental basis. Further
studies have, been: organized towards formulating appropriate guidelines in this field for operational use.

Co-Financing

The Bank has continued to seek opportunities for
co-financing, both with traditional aid-donors from inside
and outside its membership, and with existing and newly
established international organizations.

Co-financing enables the Bank to maximize its catalytic
rolein encouraging greater investmentin the region. A key
factor in the process of co-financing is the expertise
already developed by the Bank in project appraisal and implementation. The willingness of other donors to join in
co-financing enhances the impact of the Bank’s own
financial and technical resources.

During the year the Bank commenced co-financing operations with the OPEC Special Fund, and DMCs received
the first benefits from the arrangements with the European
Economic Community (EEC), which were finalized late in

1976. Thelinks created with the newly established International Fund for Agricultural Development are expected to

. lead to additional opportunities for co-financing in the near

future. Cooperation with member countries in bilateral
co-financing continued, and this led to the completion of
co-financing arrangements with Canada and New Zealand
in three of the loan projects approved in 1977. A formal
co-financing agreement with Norway was completed in
August. The groundwork was also laid during the year for
co-financing of other projects in future.

Altogether, co-financing arrangements were approved
for eight Bank-financed projects during the year. The
various co-financers provided more than $56 million in all,
the Bank's share was $111 million and the total cost of the
projects involved was estimated at $438 million.

Since the first co-financing arrangement in 1970,
co-financing has been arranged for 29 projects, for which
the Bank has provided $567 million and other donors $664
million.

Sectoral Activities

The Bank's operations in 1977 again reflected the high
priority placed by DMCs on the agricultural sector and a
continuing attention to infrastructure, particularly those of
high social content, such as water supply and urban development. The Agriculture and Agro-industry sector received 29 per cent of total lending, followed by Power, 25
per cent; Transport and Communications, 16 per cent,
Industry {including Development Banks), 16 per cent,
Water Supply and Urban Development, 12 per cent; and
Education, 2 per cent.

The Bank's strategy for agricultural assistance has
placed emphasis on an integrated approach to rural development, land utilization, water management and expansion of rural employment, as a means of dealing with the
persisting problems of unemployment and underemployment, poverty and mainutrition among the rural population
in DMCs. in addition to raising productivity and Increasing
food supplies, this integrated approach has also been
used as the main vehicle to bring about general improvements in the quality of life of the rural masses. The Bank
has stressed the need for creating conditions in rural areas
which encourage greater use of techniques that are appropriate to local resource ‘availabilities, including organizational capacity and managerial skills, and which
strengthen and improve existing institutions so that they
can operate more efficiently and equitably. The Bank has
supported efforts to encourage socially underprivileged and
economically deprived segments of the rural population to
form themselves into groups which, by facilitating their
involvement in economic activity, increases the scope of
rural dévelopment and improves the share of the poor in
productivity gains. Provision has been made in the Bank's
agricultural projects for farmer training centers, and pilot
schemes to demonstrate better water management and
other improved cultivation methods.

The Bank's agricultural development strategies have
been guided by surveys and sectoral reviews undertaken
from time to time, The Second Asian Agricultural Survey
was finalized during the year and the report on the Survey
was circulated to member governments. (A summary ofits
findings may be found on the opposite page.)

’ The Bank approved 16 loans totalling $259.7 million to
the Agriculture and Agro-industry sector in 1977, compared to 12 for $200.9 million in 1976. These inctuded ten
loans amounting to $196.4 miftion for irrigation and land
development projects. For the first time, the Bank provided

projects amounting to $21.6 million, a fertilizer and
agrochemicals storage project for $6.7 million and an agricultural credit project for $6 million were also approved.

An exampie of the integrated development approach
referred to above is the Nakdong River Basin Development Project in the Republic of Korea, which includes provision for flood contro! and irrigation works, warehouses,
small power tillers and extension services. The Second
Pahang Tenggara Regional Development Project in
Malaysia will assist in developing the whole of the Pahang
Tenggara region through the provision of access roads,
water supply schemes, housing units and commercial infrastructure. The Chashma Right Bank Irrigation Projectin
Pakistan will provide irrigation canals, drainage, service
roads, agricultural support services and consultant services, and is expected to benefit 23,000 farm families. The
Tago River Irrigation Project in the Philippines, apart from
providing irrigation and infrastructure works, includes rural
water supply and health facilities. Expansion of irrigation
facilities in the dry zone in the Hambantota district in Sri
Lanka through the Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement
Project will develop uncultivated dry areas into productive
farm tands, and also foster new ‘settlements through the
provision of basic infrastructure.

In the fisheries sub-sector, the Aquaculture Devetopment Project in Bangladesh, besides helping to meet the
protein requirements of an estimated 3.7 million people,
will employ labor-intensive methods of construction, which
are expecied to generate nine millicn man-days of
employment for unskilled workers over a five-year period.

The forestry projects will, apart from the generation of
additional employment opportunities, contribute to the
conservation of forest resources and the environment,
thereby reducing the uncontrofled destruction of forests
and mitigating associated problems of soi! erosion.AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
PROBLEMS AND STRATEGIES

An Outline of the Main Findings of the Second Asian Agricultural Survey

Asa follow-up to the Asian Agriculivral Survey that it undertook in 1967, the Bank conducied the Second
Asian Agricultural Survey (AAS il) in 1976, the results of which were disseminated in 1977. The second Survey
was directed towards an evaluation of significant aspects of recent agricultural and rural Gevelopment
experience in Asia, particularly during the period since the first Survey, and to an analysis of the tasks ahead for
the next decade, in order to evolve the elements of strategy to deal with the emerging situation and problems.

The Decade in Retrospect. Priority in AAS Ilis placed on tracing the origins of problems rélating to the
level of effective demand for foadgrains, employment, the disiribution of ownership of productive asseis and
income, and linkages between the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors of the economy. AAS II notes ther,
despite the introduction of superior agricultural technologies, the rural population has not shared much in the
benefits, Rural poverty is widespread and what evidence is available suggesis that it has worsened in the past
decade.

There continues to be @ substantial gap between yields obtained at the experimental station and these
obtained by farmers. Major problems appear to be a lack of properly trained operators; the inability to organize
farmers and rural workers effectively so that the potential for higher levels of production, efficiency and
employment can be realized; inadequate extension and input delivery systems, and structures of asset
ownership in the village, which allow the better-off farmers to benefit disproportionately from new methods of
production,

lt has been found that intersectorai linkages are constrained Dy many factors. The demand for
agricultura: production inputs from the non-agricultural sector and rural demands for non-agriculiural consumer products continue to be weak.

The impression gained from the experiences of the past decade is that many government programs
were worked out as responses to short-term situations, and that insufficient consideration was given to
assessing the implications for the long-run orientation of policy.

Tasks Ahead. Attentionis focused in AAS li on the nature and relative magnitudes of pressures in three
critica’ areas of the economic system:

(i) The capacity of domestic agriculture to provide food relative to both consumption needs and
demands. :
(i) The ability of agriculture tc absorb labor relative to the workforce available for ruralemployment.
(4) The prospects for the agricuitural sector of earning and saving foreign exchange relative to
import requiremenis.

Elements of Strategy. The broad objectives of agricultural and rural development during the next
decade have been identified as:

{i} Acceleration of growth in agricultural output.

(iil) Maximum benefits of this growth to go to the srnall farmers.

(iii) Additiona! opportunities for wage-paid employment or supplementary occupations in both farm
and non-farm activity in rural areas.

(iv) Strengthening of links between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. :

(v) Organization of production and trade in agricultural commodities in such a manner that the
DMCs’ economies can share in global increases in productivity and income, and be more
adequately safeguarded from vulnerability to fluctuations in international trade.

AAS II examines the technological requirements for agricultural growth with special emphasis on the
interaction between technological change and rural institutions. It also points out the shortcomings of present

agricultural credit systems and suggests new approaches for dealing with the problem of designing viable 
credit programs for small farmers. AAS {I also indicates other institutional changes, the reforms needed and the
directions for agricultural price policies.

Analyzing the extent and characteristics of agricultural unemployment and underemployment, AAS 1
stresses the need for increasing off-farm employment and outlines key elements ina sural employment strategy.

More Effective Foreign Aid. AAS tl examines the role of foreign aid in the context of agricultural and
tural development and discusses the self-help measures required to make such aid mere effective. In this
context, among other things, ihe need for more program (as opposed to project) assistance, more local cost
financing, further uniying of aid, and the simpiitication of procedures have been noted as requiring closer
attention.

The Report on the Second Asien Agricultural Survey was published in 1978 by Praeger Speciat Studies, New York, under the ttle
“Rural Asia: Chaltenge and Opportunity”.

Industry (including Development Banks)

The Industry (including Development Banks) sector
received seven loans (four for industrial projects and three
for DFls) totalling $137.6 million in 1977, compared to nine
loans for $204.5 million in 1976.

Bank lending to the industry sector has aimed at helping its DMCs to develop their basic industries and to
strengthen institutions which are involved in the promotion
of small and medium-scale industries, Four industrial
projects received loans amounting to $42.6 million. These
included a supplementary loan to finance the cost overrun in the Bank-financed Baturaja Cement Project in
indonesia. With the objective of promoting better quality
control in small and medium-scale industries in the
Republic of Korea, the Bank approved a loan for the
Industrial Products Inspection Centers Project — the first
loan of its kind — aimed at upgrading facilities in Korea for
the testing and inspection of indusicial products. Two
Pacific Island countries received assistance for industrial
projects — the Small Industries Center Project in Tonga
wilt assist the establishment of infrastructure facilities for
the promotion of small-scale industries in that country, and

the Coconut Oil Mill Project in Western Samoa will assist
that country fo process its main agricultural output for
export.

In 1977 three credit lines amounting to $95 million were
approved for three DFls to meet the foreign exchange
needs of industries in the countries concerned; the loan to
the National Development Finance Corporation in Pakistan
{$30 million) will finance socio-economic development
projects in the public sector in that country, while that fo the
Bank Pembangunan Indonesia ($30 million) — the first by
the Bank to a DFI in that country — will finance similar
projects in the public and private sectors in Indonesia, The
credit line to the Development Bank of the Philippines (335
million), the second to this institution, is intended for mining
and manufacturing projects in the private sector.

Through its loans to DFis, the Bank has been able to
channel and disperse medium and long-term development funds to a large number of small and medium-sized
projects, whose individual financing requirements are not
large enough to warrant the direct supervision of the Bank.
In addition, assistance to DFls tends to promote strong
and effective domestic investment institutions which couldPRINTING plant in Fiji financed with a Bank subfoan through
the Fiji Development Bank.

play an important part in mobilizing and channelling
domestic and foreign resources for investment projects.
Also, DFis have increasingly engaged in promotional
activities by identifying and formulating projects and by
assisting entrepreneurs of small and medium-sized
projects. Finally, DFls function as important centers for the
dissemination of modern business management practices
and promote adoption of appropriate technologies.

Power

In its lending to the Power sector, the Bank gives priority
to meeting the growing energy requirements of its DMCs,
with an emphasis on the development of indigenous
energy resources, as well as on the balanced growth of
transmission and distribution facilities to ensure a better
quality of supply and reduced energy losses.

Nine lodns totalling $217.6 million were approved in this
secior in 1977, compared to three loans for $128.7 million
in 1976. Five of the projects were for power generation and
related facilities, three for power transmission and distribution facilities, and one (a technical assistance loan) for
a feasibility study, detailed design and preparation
of tender documents for a large thermal generating unit.
All the generation projects were for hydropower development emphasizing the utilization of indigenous energy
resources. They included a project for setting up mini-hydropower facilities in four provincial centers in Papua New
Guinea — the first project of this nature to be assisted by
the Bank — which is well suited to meet the peculiar demand conditions in Papua New Guinea. Similar attention
was paid to particular local features in two of the distribution projects: the Power Distribution Project in Indonesia

includes a provision for coordinating the integration of vatious local and provincial projects financed by different aid
agencies into a single compatible system; while the Chittagong Power Distribution Project in Bangladesh contains a
large technical assistance component to prepare a project
for rehabilitating the power systems in that country's east
and west zones.

Power projects contribute towards improving the standard of living of the people in the areas served, and also
open up new industrial investment and employment
opportunities. The mini-hydropower project in Papua New
Guinea mentioned above will enable development fo take
place in rural areas themselves and thus minimize the
tendency for migration to urban areas with consequent
socio-economic problems. The hydropower projects in
Pakistan and Afghanistan will meet a significant power
demand for irrigation purposes, and thus help improve
agricuiturai incomes and accelerate more broadly based
regional growth in those countries.

Water Supply and Urban Development
Four loans totalling $105.3 million were approved in
1977 for the Water Supply and Urban Development sector,

FLOOD controf works on the Wampu River near Medan,
provincial capital of North Sumatra, a project designed to
benefit oif palm and rubber estates, padi fields, and about
110,000 people living in an agricultural area of about 28,000
hectares.22

compared to five loans for $75.3 million in 1976. These
included three water supply projecis, one each in the
Repubtic of Korea, Malaysia and Pakistan, and one urban
development project in Hong Kong.

The water supply project in the Republic of Korea
involves the construction of independent water supply
systems in two regional areas and will supply potable
water to various cities, towns, rural centers and industrial
complexes. The Sabah Water Supply Project in Malaysia
invoives the expansion and improvement of water supply
systems in Kota Kinabalu and Tawau and nearby rural
areas. The project in Pakistan will rehabilitate and expand
existing water supply ang sewerage systems, and help to
upgrade the present inadequate drainage system for the
city of Faisalabad. These three projects together wilt
provide an additional 700,000 CMD (cubic meters per day)
of water, increasing the aggregate system capacities
almost threefold to 1.1 million CMD. The additional number
of people who will have access to safe potable water under
these projects is estimated at nearly 1.9 million, including
500,000 in rural areas, This will be made possible by
extensive pipelaying, amounting to about 500 km., to
service additional areas. In one case, in addition to house
connecticns, an estimated 800 standpipes will be set upto
serve approximately 120,000 people from the low-income
group. The project in Pakistan will make sewerage facilities available for the first time to approximately 120,000
peopie.

The urban development project in Hong Kong will assist
in overcoming the present state of overcrowding and
substandard tiving conditions for low-income families, and
will alleviate the sociai problems associated with severe
density of population in certain areas of Hong Kong.

Transport and Communications

The Bank's lending in the Transport and Communications sector continued to emphasize the improvement of
rural road networks and feeder roads, as also rehabilitation
and development of port facilities. The main objective was
to meet growing transport needs at low cost, particularly in
the rural and undeveloped areas of the countries concerried.

Seven loans totalling $146 million were approved in
1977, four for road projects and three for part development
projects, compared to eight loans totalling $166.6 million in
1976. The loans for the road projects, one each in Bangladesh, the Republic of Korea, Papua New Guinea and the
Philippines, amounted to $116.5 miltion, involving between
them the construction and improvement of approximately
4,200 km. of roads. The projects in the Republic of Korea
and the Philippines are designed to improve road networks
in tural areas and will serve an estimated population of
three million people, providing improved access to marketing facilities and stimulating economic activities in
the areas influenced by them. These projects also include
built-in provisions for feasibility studies of further packages
of road networks for improvements envisaged in the
coming years. The remaining two projects (in Bangladesh
and Papua New Guinea}, each involving a loan of $15
million, are primarily aimed at providing improved access
between deep-water ports and their hinterlands

Apart from increasing incomes through better communications and improved access to markets for foodstuffs
and goods produced in such areas, road projects are expected to generate various socio-economic benefits for
rural people. Since, in the implementation of projects in
fabor-surpius countries, emphasis is taid on the use of
more jabor-intensive methods of construction, new job
opportunities are also créated for unskilfed labor; for instance, about 4,000 such workers are expected to find jobs
during the construction of the Khuina-Mongla Road Project in Bangladesh. Rural roads also promote baianced
development by narrowing the gap between the rural and
urban sections of society, as in the case of the projects in
the Republic of Korea and the Philippines mentioned
above.

The foans for three ports projects amounted to $28.5 milfion. The Bank's main objective in this field has been to
prepare ports in DMCs to cater for the development needs
of the countries concerned and to handle an increasing
volume of traffic as well as changing traffic demands, e.g.,
from conventional to specialized (container) vessels. Apart
from the economic benefits which usually resuft from port
improvements, namely, the reduction in overalt costs in
transferring cargo between ship and shore, port projects also
assist in facilitating access to overseas markets for domestic products from the hinterland, Among the projects
approved during the year was the Second Penang Port
Expansion Project in Malaysia, which will enable that port
to cope with growing seaborne container traffic (including
roll on-roil off and lift on-lift off operations), and the Honiara
Port Development Project in Solomon Islands. The need
for port facilities for domestic shipping also received
attention, with additional berths for inter-island ships being
provided under the Fourth Port Project in indonesiaHIGHLIGHTS OF THE BANK'S LENDING
OPERATIONS TO THE END OF 1977

Since its first oan in 1968, the Bank's lending operations have been directed towards a wide spectrum of
economic and social improvements in its OMCs. Some illustrations are as follows:

41 irrigation and area development projects covering about 849,000 ha., which support about
762,000 farmers. Total population expected to benefit — about 4.3 million.

17 fisheries development projects which will create additional employment opportunities for
about 30,000 fishermen, raise fish catch by about 333,000 m.t. per year and benefit about 17.6
million consumers.

6 fertilizer projects which will help increase the region's fertilizer supplies by 1.6 million tons of
nitrogen nutrients and 76,000 tons of phosphate nutrients per annum.

2,045 subloans to smali and medium-scale enterprises through credit lines to DFis.

64 projects for creation of 2.42 million kW of generation capacity and for about 23,000 km. of
transmission-distribution circuits; of the generation capacity to be developed, over threequarters will be in the form of low-cost hydropower,

26 water supply and sewerage projects, which will help increase water supply capacity by 5.6
tnillion cubic meters per day to 13.5 million cubic meters per day, benefitting a population of
nearly 36 million in metropolitan areas, smaller towns and provincial districts.

Construction or upgrading and improvement of 3,633 km. of roads in 29 projects, serving an
estimated population of 35.9 million

Construction, rehabilitation, modernization and expansion of ports in ten countries to increase
cargo-handling capacity by about 20 million tons per year.

Establishment of new technical and vocational education facilities in 10 separate institutes with
an annual output of 3,750 skilled workers, 3,550 technicians and 600 engineers.

Upgrading of technical and vocational education facilities in 26 separate institutes which have an
annual output of approximately 500 skilled workers, 1,850 technicians and 10,000 engineers.

By the end of the year, 81 of the 309 approved projects had been completed, and the benefits of many
other well-advanced projects were already beginning to be felt.

Education

In the Education sector, the Bank provided two loans,
totalling $20.2 million during the year, both the result of
earlier technical assistance provided by the Bank. The
Vocational Education Project in Nepal will establish a
campus of the Institute of Engineering in the eastern region
of the country, where basic technicat skills will be taught,
with specific reference to immediate focal needs and
employment opportunities, The loan includes provision for
new buildings, equipment, fellowships, expert services
and student and staff housing. The Engineering Education
Project in the Philippines is aimed at the graduate level
Through an accreditation program, staff upgrading,
curricula development and the construction of buildings
and provision of equipment, some 20 universities will be
able to provide more practically oriented programs
relevant to regional development needs in future. This
project will effect an improvement in the quality of
education provided to about 50 per cent of the total of
engineering students throughout that country.

Loan Administration

At the end of the year the Bank was administering 213
active loans, amounting to $2,900 million. Cumulative loan
disbursements since 1968 then exceeded $1,500 million
and disbursements had been completed in a total of 81
loans. As more projects entered the critical phases of
physical construction and initial testing and operation,

assigned and further efforts were made to improve and
streamline relevant procedures through the preparation of
operational manuals and staff training. A comprehensive
review of disbursements and other loan administration
matters was undertaken in order to see where further
improvements couid be made in existing practices and
procedures. At year-end, the Guidelines on Uses of Consultanis were under review.

Improvemenis introduced during the year in procedures
for the review of procurement transactions have resulted in
faster and more systematic action on the part of the Bank.
A computerized monitoring system has been developed
and is now being employed to analyze disbursement
trends and to forecasi future loan withdrawals, both on a
Project and sub-sectoral! basis. Efforts were also made to
widen the field of eligible consultants registered with the
Bank, particularly in some of the more specialized areas of
expertise.

Thirty loans became effective during the year and
disbursements were completed in 23 loans. The total value
of procurement contracts awarded during the year was
$349.1 million, while disbursements amounted to $356.2
million, compared to $365.2 million and $326.6 million,
respectively, in 1976. The percentages of cumulative
amounts of contracts awarded and disbursements, relative to the total amount of effective loans as of the end
of 1977, were 53 per cent and 44 per cent, respectively,
compared to 52 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively, in
1976.

:
Post-Evaluation

A Program for Action for evaluating completed projects
was approved by the Bankin 1974. By the end of the year a
total of 17 post-evaluation studies had been completed; 13
of these were carried out internally by staff and the
remaining four were conducted by fully independent
external evaluating agencies.

The primary purpose of post-evaluation is to ascertain
the extent to which Bank-assisted projects have achieved
their intended objectives, and to apply the experience
gained thereby to improving the Bank's operational activities.

During 1977 the Bank completed three post-evaluation
studies prepared by staff with the assistance of short-term
outside consultants, covering an agricultural credit project,
a petro-chemical (caprolactam) project, and a fisheries
project. Two other studies, one on a port project and the
other on a power project, were substantially completed. fn
addition, a group of outside experts completed a study of a

DFI project, while negotiations with another group for
carrying out a study of another fisheries project were nearing compietion.

Evaluation results show that the path towards successful project implementation has not always been smooth
and that some common probiems have been encountered
during various stages of implementation in the project
cycle. For example, virtually alt projects experienced implementation delays and, in some cases, there was the
problem of cost overruns. Another common problem was
shortfall in physical performance, particularly in agricultural projects. .

Based on the findings of post-evaluation studies, conditions for success and causes for failure of the projects
reviewed have been identified. Such findings have cot
iributed to a better understanding of project behavior which
provides a basis for improving project design and implementation of subsequent projects. The nature of feedback
of evaluation lessons varies. Some findings are project
specific, while others show promise of sectoral applica:
bility. As thes number of completed projects increases,
post-evaluation results, systematicaly compiled and
analyzed, will become an important tool of management
for the Bank as well as for the executing agencies con”
cerned. In the meanwhile, a review has been initiated of
the post-evaluation policies and procedures of the Bank
with a view inter alia to streamlining them and increasing
their impact on the Bank's operational functions. The re
cently constituted Audit Committee" is fully involved in this
matter.

Technical Assistance and Regional Activities

Technical Assistance Activities

An important element of the Bank's developmental rote
is the provision of technical assistance to DMCs,
especially to improve their capability to make effective use
of external project financing, whether from the Bank or
from other sources.

The main vehicie for Bank financing of this nature is the
Technical Assistance Special Fund, established in 1968,
to which both developed and developing member countries of the Bank had contributed a total of $31.1 million by
the end of 1977. Technical assistance operations are also
financed trom net income from the Bank's ordinary capital
resources from time to time. !n addition, the Bank administers technical assistance projects financed by other
sources, such as UNDP and the EEC, while it cooperates
with FAO on a cost-sharing basis in providing project pre
paratory technical assistance in the field of agricuiture.

Among the more specific objectives of technical assistance activities are efforts to improve the technical, managerial and organizational capabilities of DMCs; to identify,
formulate and implement development projects more effectively; to establish and strengthen DMCs’ various development institutions; and to formulate national or sectoral development strategies and pians.

The Bank's technical assistance operations expanded
substantially in 1977, both in the amount of assistance provided and the number of projects assisted. Forty-two technical assistance projects amounting to $7.2 million’ were
approved during the year, compared to 24 amounting to
$4.6 million in 1976. Of these, 14 projects were wholly or
partly financed from other sources in 1977, with the Bank
acting as Executing Agency.

Project preparatory technical assistance amounted to
$6 million for 34 projects, while advisory and operational
technical assistance amounted to $1.2 million for eight
projects. in addition, technical assistance components
were included in many of the Bank's loans — amounting to
$6.8 million in all, $2.6 million for project preparatory purposes and $4.2 million for project implementation.

Seventeen DMCs received technical assistance in 1977
— Cook Islands for the first time. The fully eligible Special
Funds countries received $4.5 million for 24 projects, compared to $3.3 million for 15 projects in 1976.

Technical assistance continued to be a large and highly
effective component of the Bank's activities in the Pacific
region, where there are generally substantial gaps In technical know-how and expertise. A total of seven technical
assistance grants, amounting to $605,000, were provided
to Pacific DMCs in 1977 — four advisory and three for project preparation.

On a sectoral basis, 55 per cent of the total amount of
technical assistance approved in 1877 was provided for
agriculture {irrigation, livestock, fisheries, forestry, paim oil
and integrated rural development) and agro-industry
{cotton storage and sugar). Of the remainder, about 13 per
cent was provided for industry, 10 pey cent for power development, 10 per cent for ports and roads, $ per cent for
education and 3 per cent for water supply and urban development.

Seventeen loan projects approved in 1977 resulted from
earlier technical assistance provided by the Bank. The
total amount of such loans was $348 million. The total cost
of the earlier technical assistance was $7.5 million, comprising $2 million provided on a grant basis and $5.5 million
provided on a {oan basis. By the end of 1977, cumulatively,
91 loans totalling $1,281 mitlion had resulted from technical assistance provided by the Bank costing $13.7 million
in all.

Twenty-two technical assistance projects were completed in 1877, 18 for project preparation and four for advisory and operational purposes, bringing the total number
of technical assistance projects completed thus far to 144.

The total amount of technical assistance approvais to
the end of 1977 stood at $35.4 million’

Regional Activities

Seven regional activities, mainly in the fields of agriculture and development banking, were financed by the
Bank in 1977 at a total cost of $908,820 (see opposite
page for details).

An amount of $91,000 was approved for Follow-Up
Activities on the Findings of the Second Asian
Agricultural Survey (AAS I!). The Report on the Survey,
which was undertaken in 1976, was provisionally printed
in Aprit for circulation primarily to member governments
and for the Bank’s own internal requiremenis. A summary of the major findings of AAS II may be found on page
19, The follow-up activities undertaken in 1977 were the
printing of the edited Report for wide commercial distribution — the Report will appear early in 1978 — anda
Press Seminar in Tokyo in October in conjunction with the
Nomura Research institute. Two sub-regional seminars,
to analyze and discuss implications of the Survey with
senior policy-makers from DMCs, and the production of a
television program and radio broadcasts for dissemination
in interested member countsies, were scheduled for early
1978.

A grant of $500,000 was made to the International Rice
Research Institute (IRRi) at Los Bafos io increase the size
of its rice variety development program and to expand its
genetic evaluation and utilization program. The grant will
be used to procure equipment for a Rice Genetic Resources Laboratory, the construction cost of which ($1.6
million) is being financed by Japan under the auspices
of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural
Research. The Laboratory will expedite the development
of superior rice lines and varieties for use throughout
the world, especially in Asia, and will be the focal point for
an international complex which will collect, preserve, disseminate and test rice germ plasm, IRR! received an earlier grant of $300,000 from the Bank in 1975 for the expansion of its research and training facilities, and the
high-yielding rice varieties and breeding lines developed
by IRR} over the fast decade have been of great benefit to
Bank-financed irrigation projects.

A Regional Seminar on the Application of Appropriate Technology in Road Construction and Maintenance was sponsored by the Bank in collaboration with
the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the Swedish International Development Authority. The Bank contributed an amount of $33,500 towards the cost of the Seminar, which was held in Manila from 16 to 25 May. Its main
aim was to show how resource allocation in the roads sector, which often represents a substantial proportion of government investment in developing countries, can be made
more effective by the inclusion of labor-intensive methods.

The Seminar was atténded by senior government officials from 17 DMCs, specialists in particular aspects of
appropriate technology in road construction and maintenance, representatives of various international organizations and institutions, and ILO staff members concerned with appropriate construction technology. Various
aspects of labor-based and intermediate technologies in
road construction and maintenance were examined and
the current practices prevailing in the countries of Asia and
the Pacific reviewed. Guidelines for future action to
promote the use of appropriate technology in the region
were formulated.REGIONAL ACTIVITIES iN 1977

The Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO)
sponsored a six-day Working Group Meeting on PreInvestment Planning for Water Supply and Sewerage
Development at WHO's Regional Headquarters in Manila
in- October. The Meeting was attended by senior government officials involved in development planning for
this sector,in 12 DMCs. It was conducted against the
background of the emerging “basic needs" strategy, which
emphasizes the commitments of governments to the provision of minimum human necessities of food, water, sanitation and housing as a major development abjective.
Ways and means of reducing investment backlogs and of
accelerating investment in rural water supply and sanitation, and urban water supply and waste disposal, were examined and recommendations were made on ways of
overcoming constraints on development in this sector, with
special emphasis on institution-buildirig and information
transfer. The need for longer-term national and regional
planning, and coordination with other sectors in the context
of area development, was highlighted. The Bank contributed an amount of $22,600 to the cost of the Meeting.

A Training Program on Development Banking for
the South Pacific Region was held in Papua New Guinea
{Port Moresby and Goroka) and Fiji (Suva) from 12 September to 29 October, in collaboration with the Papua New
Guinea Development Bank and the Fiji Development
Bank. An amount of $114,500 was provided for this purpose by the Bank. Twenty-two professional staff from six
Pacific DFis and seven concerned government departments attended the Program, which was geared to an
analysis of small agricultural and industrial projects. Particular.emphasis was placed on the financial aspects of
project appraisal and on the role of promotional activities in
the development of the Pacific region. The Bank has so far
organized five regional programs on development
banking, which have helped to train 110 staff members

from 35 DFIs and seven concerned government departments in 20 OMCs.

The Bank held a Regional Course on Agricultural
Development Banking (the second undertaken by the
Bank) in Jakarta from 7 November to 16 December, in collaboration with the Bank Rakyat Indonesia, the Foundation
for the Development of Banking in Indonesia and the
German Foundation for International Development. The
Course was attended by 25 participants trom 18 agricultural finance corporations, cooperatives, commercial
banks and other institutions dealing with the agricultural
sectors in 11 DMCs. The Course, designed for training officers of agricultural credit institutions, covered institutional
aspects of agricultural banking, particularly as these concern small farmers. Special consideration was given to a
study of various possible for ms of agricultural creditinstitutions, including their lending policies and procedures. The
Bank provided an amount of $116,320 for the Course.

A grant of $31,500 was approved for the Asian Productivity Organization's (APO} Eighth Project Feasibility Study Training Course, to be held in the Philippines
(Stage 1) and Japan (Stage [}) from January to March 1978.
The Bank had earlier provided assistance for the preceding
five APO Project Feasibility Study Training Courses. The
Seventh Course was held in the Philippines in January and
February 1977 and was attended by 29 participants from
12 countries, including 11 regional member countries of
the Bank.

Throughout 1977 the Bank continued to assist in the implementation of Phase I} of the Nam Ngum Hydropower
Project in the Lao Peopie's Democratic Republic inits role
as Administrator of the Second Nam Ngum Development
Fund and Coordinator of the execution of the Project. With
the Bank's assistance, sufficient funds have been mobilized from ten Contributor Governments for financing the
Project, now estimated to cost approximately $44 million.
Project works progressed considerably during the year,
and the commissionjng of the Project is expected to take
place substantially on schedule in June 1978.

By the end of, the year total approvals for regional
activities amounied to $7.3 million.

Lending and Operational Policies

Review of the Criteria for Lending from the Asian
Development Fund

A review of the criteria for lending from the Asian Development Fund (ADF}, the Bank’s concessional lending
window, was carried out in September. The main conclusions reached were as follows:

(i} The eligibility of a DMC for ADF loans should cantinue to be determined on country considerations, i.e.,
on the basis of a country’s economic situation. (ii) Per
capita GNP should be used as a basic indicator of a
DMC's economic situation for the purpose of grouping
DMCs into those eligible and those not eligible for ADF
loans, with $380 in terms of per capita GNP in 1975 as
the benchmark. tn determining eligibility, a DMC's
debt-repayment capacity should also be considered.
{iit} Certain DMCs in the Pacific, because of their peculiar economic circumstances, should continue to receive
special consideration in the application of the per capita

GNP and the debt-repayment capacity criteria in deter
mining their eligibility for ADF loans,

in allocating ADF resources among eligible DMCs, the
general principle to be observed is that DMCs which are
least developed, or most seriously affected by recent world
economic developments, will have first priority. A DMC
fully eligible for ADF loans may also receive ordinary loans
on a case-by-case basis if the size of the Bank’s operational program in the country is farger than can reasonably
be financed from the ADF, and if the country has the capacity to absorb the harder terms of ordinary loans. In applying the blending principie, priority in the allocation of ADF
resources should be given to projects with a high social
and economic value but a low financial rate of return, or low
foreign exchange earning capacity, or long gestation period.

The criteria for lending from the ADF wiil be further reviewed in 1978.

Guarantee Operations

The possibility of the Bank engaging in guarantee operations was considered during the year. This was done in
response to a recommendation by the Development Com
mittee! that the World Bank and the regional banks should
use their existing powers to consider requests for guarantees, or partial guarantees, of bond issues made by
interested developing countries. The genera! question of
guarantees by international financial institutions and the
Bank's own position in the light of the limitations placed on
such operations by its Charter was carefully examined. In
the event it was decided that the Bank should take no further initiative in regard to this matter at the present time.
However, the Bank would be prepared to consider, on its
merits, and in partial substitution for a direct loan, any proposal that might be received from a potential borrower for
the use of the guarantee mechanism in relation to specific
major projects where the total foreign exchange costs are
too large to be fully financed through Bank loan and cofinancing arrangements. In the meantime, the Bank would
continue to assist DMCs in obtaining co-financing on reasonabie terms, including co-financing with commercial
Danks.

Review of Loan Regulations

Revised Ordinary Operations Loan Regulations (formerly Loan Regulations No. 1} and revised Special Operations Loan Regulations were adopted in February.
The main objective of the revisions was to simplify and clarify the existing Regulations. Pursuant to Section 11 of the
Bank's By-Laws, the revised Loan Regulations were reviewed and noted by the Board of Governors at ihe Tenth
Annual Meeting.

Review of Technical Assistance Activities

in May the Bank's technical assistance policies were
reviewed and modified, with a view to making technical
assistance operations more responsive to the needs of
OMCs in future.

lt was decided that technical assistance would be provided by the Bank not only to prepare projects for its own financing, but also for financing by other aid agencies, and
that technical assistance aimed at improving technical,
managerial and administrative capabilities in borrowing
countries would be expanded. In addition, increasing attention would be given to sectoral and problem-oriented
studies, which may or may not be related to specific development projects. In all these endeavors, special attention would be paid to the needs of the less developed
OMCs in view of the particular problems which they faced

in preparing and implementing development projects. A
further objective set was to encourage, through technical
assistance operations, closer cooperation among DMCs.

In order to pave the way for the realization of these
objectives. operating procedures were liberalized in certain respects. The specific changes made were:

{i} The limit which the Bank may provide as a grant
in technical assistance for project preparation
(e.g. for a feasibility study) would be $150,000 in
tuture, instead of $100,000.

(i) Technical assistance programs, involving Ihe
preparation of a number of sub-projects, would
be eligible for technical assistance loans

(iii) Retroactive financing of technical assistance
would be provided under certain conditions,
mainly in respect of consultants services for feasibility studtes and detailed engineering.

(iv) The services of loca! consultants would be financed on the same basis as if a foreign firm had
been engaged, subject to conformity with the
Bank's normal selection procedures for consultants.

{v) Foreign exchange financing of certain local currency expenditures would be provided on a caseby-case basis, up to a maximum of 10 per cent of
the amount of the relevant technical assistance
grant.interagency Cooperation

The Bank continued to recognize the importance of
keeping in close contact with other institutions interested in
economic development in Asia. Special attention was paid
in 1977 to setting up institutional arrangements for
cooperation with the newer funding agencies — initially the
OPEC Special Fund and later IFAD — and for strengthening operational links with the EEC and with such
specialized agencies as FAO,ILO, WHO etc. Working relations with the World Bank and UNDP continued to be
close.

The annual consultations between the Presidents of the
African, the Asian and the Inter-American Development
Banks — the eighth in the series — were held in Washington, D.C. in September 1977. The World Bank was aiso represented, Topics discussed included the role of these
international institutions in the development of mineral and
energy resources, matters related to their financial policies
and the status of the replenishment of their respective resources. A separate session was held with representatives
of the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development,
the OPEC Special Fund, the European Investment Bank
and the European Development Fund.

World Bank Group

Cooperation between the Bank andthe World Bank continued through frequent visits by officers and exchanges of
information on operational activities and country ecsnomic
developments. The Bank was represented as an observer

at the IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings held in Washington, D.C. in September. Furthermore, the President
attended meetings of the Development Committee of the
IMF-IBRD in Washington, D.C. in May and September. The Bank was also represented at the aid coordination
meetings held in 1977 under the auspices of the World
Bank for Bangladesh, the Republic of Korea, Nepal,
Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

International Fund for Agricultural Development
{iFAD)

The year 1977 marked the formal establishment of
IFAD. After two further sessions of its Preparatory Commission in April and July, IFAD came into existence on
30 November. The inaugural sessions of the IFAD Governing Council and Executive Board were held in Rome
in mid-December. The Bank was represented as an
observer at the sessions of the Preparatory Commission
and the Governing Council and strengthened its close association wiih, and assistance to, IFAD in various ways.
The secondment of a staff member to the Preparatory
Commission for IFAD was extended to almost the entire
year. Close consultations were held with the Preparatory
Commission, particularly on operational and financial
matters. A draft cooperation agreement between IFAD
and the Bank was provisionally approved in June. This
took into account corresponding draft cooperation
agreements between IFAD and other multilateral financial
institutions, Potentiai projects suitable for early iFAD
financing were discussed with IFAD representetives. From

1978 onwards the Bank expects to be actively involved in
co-financing and administering projects financed by
IFAD, with a view to accelerating agricultural development
in the region.

European Economic Community (EEC)

The framework for cooperation between the EEC and
the Bank, which was established towards the end of 1976,
came into effect with a Financing Agreement concluded in
January. Under this agreement, the EEC offered a grant of
$1.98 million from its 1976 budget to finance a number of
technical assistance projects to be prepared and executed
by the Bank in several of its less developed DMCs. Of
those proposals considered, seven technical assistance
projects totalling $1.5 million were approved in 1977 for
EEC financing with the Bank acting as Executing Agency.
in addition to the above, the EEC provided $200,000 for
the inland fisheries portion of the Second Fisheries
Development Project in Bangladesh approved by the Bank
in 1976.

In September the Bank entered into discussions with the
EEC on its offer to co-finance selected rural development
loan projectsin less developed DMCs. As aresult, the EEC
agreed to co-finance projects with the Bank on a grant
basis to the extent of about $140 million from its 1977
budget. Part of this amount has already been allocaled to
two projects in Pakistan and Afghanistan (see Table on
page 16). In addition, the EEC has agreed to allocate
$448,000 from its 1977 budget for financing various technical assistance projects to be executed by the Bank in
1978.

OPEC Special Fund

During the Tenth Annual Meeting of the Bank in April, he
Director-General of the OPEC Special Fund had substantive discussions with delegations from several DMCs and
Sank staff on possible cooperation between the Bank and
the OPEC Special Fund. As a result of these discussions

finalized (see Table on page 16), Loan agreements were
entered into between the Fund and the DMCs concerned,
and letters have been exchanged between the Fund
ard the Bank in regard to the execution of these projects.

United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)

The Bank continued its cooperation with UNDP during
the year. There were frequent consultations and
exchanges of information between UNOP Headquarters
and field offices and the Bank. The Bank was represented at the Twenty-Third and Twenty-Fourth Sessions
of the Governing Council of UNDP and aiso at the meetings of the Committee on Technica! Cooperation among
Developing Countries. During the year the Bank agreed to
act as Executing Agency for UNDP-financed ($470,000)
technicai assistance for the Sikta Irrigation anc Rural Deveiopment Project in Nepal and for UNDP financing
($150,000) of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Project in Bangladesh, to which the Bank itself contributed
$350,000.

Food and Agriculture Organization (FAC)

The Bank's association with FAO in project activity was
more extensive in 1977 than in any year since the Interim
Arrangements for Cooperative Action were established in
1968. FAO provided teams of experts on a cost-sharing
basis for project preparatory technical assistance for five
separate projects, two of which led to loans from the Bank
within the year. An FAO specialist also participated in a
Bank project identification mission to Bangladesh early in
the year, while close contact has been maintained with
FAQ concerning its other activities in most DMCs.

Other International Organizations

Cooperation with WHO was continued through informal
meetings and regular exchanges of information. Bank
missions held discussions with WHO regional officers and
experts on matters of common interestin pursuing relevant
operational activities. In March the Bank approved, and
co-sponsored with WHO, a Working Group on Pre-Investment Planning for Water Supply and Sewerage Deveiopment (see page 29).

in December 1976 discussions were held with senior officials of the ILO about the possibilities of cooperation between the Bank and that institution in future. This resulted
in technical assistance being provided by the Bank for the
Regional Seminar on the Application of Appropriate Technology in Road Construction and Maintenance (see page
28).

There was continuing cooperation, including exchanges
of staff visits, between the Bank and other international
organizations, such as the United Nations Educational,

AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Review of Financial Policies

EARLY IN 1977 a comprehensive review was made of the
Bank's financial policies, including the lending rate and
commitment charge, liquidity policy and borrowings, and
other factors affecting the Bank's financial position (see
page 57). The maintenance of the Bank's net income and
reserves at satisfactory levels was accepted as an impertant financial objective. The liquidity policy was
modified; this resulted in a slight reduction in projected
liquidity requirements. The Bank's financial policies are to
be reviewed annually at the beginning of each year.

Increase in Capital Stock

The Second Genera! Capital Increase authorized under
Board of Governors’ Resolution No. 104' became effective
on 30 September 1977, the date originally approved, when
subscriptions were received from 20 member countries
amounting to $3.257 million, As of 31 December 1977
subscriptions amounting to $3,272 million from a total of 24
member countries had been received.

Capital

As of 31 December 1977 the authorized capital stock of
the Bank was $8,711 million (722,057 shares), having
been increased by $5,004 million (414,800 shares) when
the second general capital increase mentioned above
became effective. The subscribed capital stock was
$6,961. million (577,025 shares), consisting of $5,457 million (451,873 shares) in callable capital and $1,510 million
(125,152 shares) in paid-in capital. The subscribed capital
was increased during the year by $3,273 million (271,277
shares) on account of: (i) a subscription by Western Samoa of $108,572 (nine shares) under the first general capital increase authorized by Resolution No. 462 and a subscription by the same member country to a special capital
increase of $120,635 (ten shares); and (ii) the subscriptions by 24 member countries of $3,272 million (271,258
shares) under the second general capital increase.

$117 million were undertaken,

Deutsche Mark Public tssue

In April the Bank made @ public offering in the Federal
Republic of Germany of DM100 million with an interest
rate of 7 per cent per annum payable annually, a full maturity of eight years and an issue price at par.

Two-Year United States Dollar Bonds

Also in April, Two-Year Bonds totalling $70 million, with
an interest rate of 62 per cent per annum payable semiannuaily, were sold at par to central banks and monetary

- authorities of 30 member countries. For the most part, pur
chases of the bonds were made by rolling over holdings of
the maturing 1975 issue of Two-Year Bonds, the aggregate principal amountof which was also $70 million.

Lending Rate

The lending rate of the Bank was reviewed in February
1977, and also in April, July and October. Taking into
account the trends in capital markets, the lending rates of
other financial institutions and the financial situation of the
Bank, the lending rate, which had been fixed ai 8.70 per
cent per annum with effect from 1 January 1977. was revised to 8.30 per cent per annum with effect from 1 July
1977." Pursuant to the decision taken in July, the raie
remained unchanged thereafter.

Member Currencies

In terms of the decision taken on 31 August 1972. the
Bank adopted new exchange rates in respect of the currencies of 27 member countries for translaticn in its accounts and for purposes relating to the maintenance of
value of such currencies held by the Bank. Most amounts
receivable from or payable to member countries in respect
of such maintenance of vatue obligations falling due in
1977 had been settled by the end of the year.

Loan Disbursements and Repayments

Bank and $1.5 million on portions of loans sold to participants. Cumulative loan repayments up to the end of 1977
reached $131.7 million, consisting of $121.1 million on
loans held by the Bank and $10.6 million on portions sold to
participants.

Participations

A decline in interest rate tevels in the United States in the
fatter part of 1976 led to some revival of investor interestin
participating in the Bank's loans. Sales of participations in
several ioans were negotiated with a number of financial
institutions in late 1876/eariy 1977, resulting in sales
during 1977 of $2.4 million. Aggregate sales of participations as at the end of the yearfamounted to $17.2
million.

Investments

At the end of the year the Bank's total investments —
held in 22 separate currencies — amounted to the equiv~
alent of $1,009 million, of which 33.6 per cent was held in
government securities and government-guaranteed obligations of member countries and 66.4 per cent in time deposits and certificates of deposit with banks in member
countries and the Bank for International Settlements,

Of the total investments in government securities and
government-guaranteed obligations of member countries,
53.9 per cent was invested in securities maturing within
one year and 46.1 per cent in securities maturing after one
year. Of the total investments in time deposits and certificates of deposit with banks in member countries and the
Bank for International Settlements; 50.2 per cent was
invested in deposits maturing within one year and 49.8 per
cent in deposits maturing after one year.

Income and Expenses’

Gross income of the Bank in 1977, before net gain from
changes in the value of currencies, was $168.6 million, an
increase of $40.3 million, or 31.4 per cent on that for the
preceding year.

Administrative Expenses, after deducting $7.1 million
attributable to Special Funds operations, were $14 million.
Services to Member Countries amounted to $1.2 million,
while Financial Expenses were $90.9 million. Gross
Expenses for the year thus amounted to $106.1 million,

Net income for the year before net gain from changes in
the vaiue of currencies was therefore $62.5 million. There
was anet gain of $19.9 million on account of changes inthe
value of currencies during the year which increased the net
income to $82.4 million, of which $10.1 million was appropriated as commission to Special Reserve. The Bank's Net
Income after Appropriation of Commissions to Special
Reserve was therefore $72.4 million, as shown in
Appendix 1-1I.

Accumulated Net Income and Reserves

As of 31 December 1877, Ordinary Reserve amounted
io $142.2 million, having been increased by the Net Income After Appropriation of Commissions to Special Reserve for 1976 totalling $40.6 million, which the Board of
Governors allocated to Ordinary Reserve at the Tenth
Annuat Meeting.

The Bank also has a Special Reserve representing commissions appropriated pursuant to Articles 16 and 17. The
amount was $18.7 mitlion as of 31 December 1976. This
was increased by $10.1 million during the year to $28.8
million as of 31 December 1977.

The combined total of the two Reserves maintained by
the Bank therefore amounted to $171 million at the end of
1977.

SPECIAL FUNDS

THE Asian Development Fund (ADF) was established in
June 1974 in order to provide a systematic mechanism for
mobilizing and administering resources for the Bank to
lend on concessional terms. Administration of the earlier
Speciai Funds — the Multi- Purpose Special Fund (MPSF)
and the Agricultural Special Fund (ASF) — had been compiicated by the fact that contributions of individual donors
had been made voluntarily at the initiative of the countries
concerned and were frequently tied to procurement in
those countries. Under the restructuring proposals, the
ASF was wound up in the first half of 1973 and its resources consolidated with those of the MPSF. Nearly all of
the resources of the MPSF have now been transferred to
the ADF.

The initial mobilization of ADF resources (ADF |) was
intended to finance the Bank's concessionaf tending program for the three-year period ending 31 December 1975.
Contributions to ADF | totalling $486.1 million have been
received from 14 countries. At the end of 1975 the Board of
Governors authorized’ a replenishment of the resources
of the ADF (ADF Hi}, intended to finance the Bank's concessional lending program over the period 1976-1978. The
amount initially authorized was $830 million, but this was
subsequently reduced to $809 million, By the end of 1977,
14 of the Bank’s developed member countries had participated in ADF II with total contributions of $581 million.
During 1977 negotiations commenced on a second ADF
replenishment (ADF Ili).

Progress of the First ADF Replenishment (ADF 11)
The scheme envisaged for ADF I! had contemplated the
release of contributions in three annual instalments in
1976, 1977 and 1978. The first instalments were released
in June 1976, when the Bank had received instruments of
contribution exceeding the trigger amount of $475 million.
By the end of 1976 eleven countries, namely, Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Federal Republic of
Germany, italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway and United
Kingdom, had contributed to the replenishment, In the first
quarter of 1977 Switzerland deposited its instrument of
contribution, thereby bringing contributions to $565 million,
of which the first instalments, totailing $188.3 million, had
been released to the Bank. The trigger figures specified in Resolution No. 92 for the release of the second
instalments assumed, however, that the United States
would have commiited to the Bank its coniribution of $180
million and paid its first instalment of $60 million. By the

early months of 1977 it had become clear that the United
States would not be in a position to release its first instalment before the last quarter of 1977, at the earliest. Consequenily, in order to enable the Bank to continue its concessionai tending program for 1977, the Board of Governors agreea on 14 April 1977 to reduce the second instalment trigger figures from $650 million to $550 million in
terms of commitments, and from $200 million to $185 million in terms of payments.* As a result, the second instalments of the 12 contributions committed as of that date became effective. :

During the second quarter of 1977 the Bank received
instruments of contribution from New Zealand and
Sweden, thus bringing to 14 the number of countries which
had contributed to ADF tl. The total amount so committed
by these 14 donor countries was $581 million; of this
amount, $389 million, representing the first two instalments? was unconditionally available to the Bank. In
the final months of the year legislative action was
completed for the appropriation of a portion amounting to
$49.5 million of the United States’ first instalment, thus
clearing the way for the release of the third and final
instalments of the contributions of the other donor
countries.

Inflow of Resources

The resources of the ADF and the MPSF at the end of
41976 totalled $932 million at prevailing exchange rates.
Against these resources, loan commitments totalling $890
mitlion had been approved, leaving a balance of only $42
million available for further lending on concessional terms.

The second instalments of ADF fl contributions added a
total of $206 million (at the exchange rates as of 31 December 1977) to the resources becoming unconditionally
available to the Bank during 1977. The first instalments of
the new contributions committed during the year by New
Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland added a further $9 million to available resources.

In June 1977 the Bank received the remaining $25 million of the United States’ contribution to ADF |. The Board
of Governors had amended Resolution No. 68 in October
1976 to permit the Bank to accept the outstanding contribution of $50 million to ADF } by the United States in two
equal instalments.* The first such instalment was received

which had indicated their intention to participate in ADF |
and brought their total contributions to $486 million.

Individual contributions to the MPSF and ADF have
been made in the national currencies of the respective
contributors. Maintenance of value obligations, which
apply in the case of subscriptions to the Bank's capital
stock, do not apply to these contributions. Consequently,
the total value of the resources made availabie to the Bank

‘for these Funds fluctuates with changing exchange rates.

In some years, partly as a result of significant depreciations in the currencies of some major contributions
against the United States dollar — in which the Bank’sioan
commitments are denominated — the Bank has found the
resources available for meeting its lending targets to be
substantially jess than it had expected when those targets
were established. However, sharp appreciations in some
major currencies during 1977 resulted in an increase in resources of the equivalent of US$116 million. Totai resources of the ADF and MPSF at the end of 1977 stood at
$1,285 million, an increase of $353 million since the end of
1976.SPECIAL FUNDS LOANS APPROVED IN 1977

Utilization’

The total of ADF loan commitments in 1977 was $272
million, $36 milion above that of the previous year. As of 31
December 1977 the cumulative amount committed in
loans (after allowing for exchange rate adjustments, cancellations and repayments) from the combined resources
of the ADF and MPSF was $1,192 million, leaving a balance of uncommitted resources at that time of $93 million.
Loan disbursements in 1977 amounted to $83.8 million,
bringing total disbursements from Special Funds resources to $295 million. Loan repayments in 1977 totalled $3.2
million; cumulative repayments up to the end of 1977
amounted to $5.9 million.

+ See chagier on Overaticns ard Poticies for description of lending from Special Funds and also tab:es above and on page 58.

Criteria for Lending from the ADF

The criteria for ADF lending were reviewed in September. An account of the review and its conclusions may be
found on pages 29 and 33.

Income and Expenses '

At the end of 1976 the MPSF nad an accumulated net
income of $289,378. In furtherance of the general objective of consolidating in the ADF to the greatest extent possible the resources still being administered in the MPSF,
this amount was transferred in 1977 to the ADF, as reported to the Board of Governors at the Tenth Annual Meeting. In 1977 the MPSF had a gross income of $555,480.

- expenses of $186,946, a net gain from changes in the

value of currencies of $99,576, and a resultant net income
of $468,110. This has been credited to Accrued Resources
of the MPSF in accordance with the Special Funds Rules
and Regulations. :

In 1977 the ADF had a gross income of $22.6 million,
gross expenses of $6.9 million and a net gain from
changes in the value of currencies of $1.6 million. Net
income for 1977 was therefore $17.3 million, bringing
accumulated net income to the end of 1977 to $28.6 million (see table on page $5).

Second Replenishment of the Asian Development
Fund {ADF If}

A meeting of ADF donor countries was held in Manila in
April 1977 at the time of the Tenth Annual Meeting to consider the resource position of the ADF, and the steps
needed to be taken towards a second replenishment. The
Bank's proposals for ADF Ill, designed to cover the program of lending on concessional terms envisaged over the
four-year petiod 1979-1982, were considered at a meeting
of donor countries in Kyoto in October. Although not alt
donor countries were then in 4 position to express definitive views on the amount of the proposed replenishment,
the need for a substantial replenishment was generally
accepted. It was decided that a further meeting would be
held in Geneva in February 1978 to discuss the Bank's
proposals, as well as the matter of an appropriate framework for the implementation of those proposals.

Transfer of Resources of the Multi-Purpose Special
Fund

A further step was taken in April 1977 towards completing the transfer to the ADF of the resources previously
administered in the MPSF, when an agreement for the
transfer of Australia's initial MPSF contribution (which had
been fully disbursed by the end of 1976) was concluded. At
the end of 1977 the only amounts remaining in the MPSF
were the uncommitted balance of $7.4 million of Canada’s
initial contribution and an amount of $773,346 on account
of accrued income and other credit. (Agreement for the
transter of Canada’s tied contribution had been reachedin
March 1976 whereby a portion was then untied and transferred immediately, with the balance to be transferred as
committed).

Procurement and Drawdown Arrangements
In February new arrangements were approved govern
+ Exglud:ng Techrical Assistance Sreczal Furd

5354

ing the determination of procurement eligibility under loans
financed from ADF resources, and the drawdown of such
resources to finance loan disbursements. Under these
atrangements, procurement under ADF toans is to be
limited to suppliers from alt developed member countries
with contributions currently under administration in the
ADF, as well as from DMCs. The drawdown arrangements
are designed to give effect to the requirement of the ADF
Regulations that contributions to the ADF be drawn uponin
such a manner that, over reasonable periods of time, the
Proportion of ail contributions drawn down would be
uniform. Pursuant to these arrangements, a total of $116
million was drawn down in 1977 from reciprocally untied
ADF contributions. Until the Bank has accumulated in the
ADF a substantial amount of resources other than contributed resources, disbursements under ADF loans are to
be financed as far as practicable by drawing upon contributions. Net income, repayments of ADF loans, and
set-aside resources are to be retained primarily as a
source of investment income. Wherever possible, the
Bank is to give priority to the utilization of tied contributions,
which by their nature cannot be treated under the uniform
drawdown arrangements. A total of $2.9 million was
drawn down from tied contributions in 1977.

Technical Assistance Special Fund
During 1977 initial contributions to the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) were made by two member

countries, while further contributions were made by slx
other countries, as follows:

The contribution from Japan was substantially untied,
while those from Hong Kong, India, the Netherlands and
Sweden were conditionally untied to procurement of goods
and/or services from the donor country concerned and
from DMGs generally. The contributions from Canada, Pakistan and the United Kingdom were tied to procurement of
goods and/or services trom those countries. The total
amounts of substantially or conditionally untied contributions represented 74.8 per cent of ali contributions made
during the year.

As of 31 December 1977 total contributions to the Fund
amounted to $31.1 million, of which $15 million had been
utilized by the Bank.

close proximity to the Headquarters, on which the Bank
proposes to construct a building to provide additional office
accommodation, for which there is a pressing and growing
need. Meanwhite, the host Government has kindly offered
the Bank the temporary rent-free use of space in the
Central Bank building complex. The transfer of certain staft
units to these temporary offices will take place early in
1978.

Staff

By 31 December 1977, the Bank's staff had reached a
total of 803 from 32 member countries. Of ‘these, 304
belonged to the professional staff category and 499 to the
supporting staff category. The overall increase during the
year was 44, comprising 16 professional staff and 28 supporting staff.

The Secretary of the Bank,’ Mr. D. C. Gunesekera,
retired on 31 August and was succeeded by Mr. S. Sardadi
on 30 November.

Budget for 1978

Administrative Expenses for 1977 totalled $22,064,387,
representing 97.5 per cent of the original Budget figure of
$22,628.000.

The Budget for 1978 is summarized in Appendix 2.

Internal Administrative Expenses for 1978 are estimated
at $25,957,000,’ representing an increase of 17.6 per cent
on actual expenditure in 1977. This increase is attributable
largely to: (i) the growth in loan, technical assistance and
other activities, requiring additional staff, more business
travel and greater use of consultants’ services; (ji) the
full-year effect of the salary increases arid improvements
in staff benefits approved in 1977; and (iii) anticipated
general price increases in 1978.

Disbursements on Servicesto Member Countriesin 1978
are estimated at $4,756,100, which is 57.6 per cent above
actual disbursements in 1977. This is mainly due to the expected impact on 1978 disbursements of the larger
number of projects approved in 1977.

(1) Unit of Account
The Ordinary Capital Resources financial statements are
expressed in current United States Dollars.

Assets and liabilities in currencies other than United
States Dollars were translated at the applicable rates
of exchange which prevailed at the end of the year,
except that, starting in 1977, unamortized issuance costs
of borrowings in such currencies were translated at
applicable historical rates.

The capital stock, which is defined in Article 4, paragraph
7 of the Articles of Agreement in terms of the United
States Dollar of the weight and fineness in effect on 31
January 1966, was translated into current United States
Dollars on the basis of 1.20635 current dotlars per 1966
dollar.

Except for the 1977 amortization of issuance costs of
borrowings, income and expense amounts in currencies
other than United States Dollars were translated for each
quarter generally at the rates of exchange which prevailed
at the beginning of the quarter; such practice approximates the apptication of average rates in effect during the
quarter. Starting in 1977, amortization of issuance costs
was translated at applicable historical rates. This change
did not have a material effect on the 7977 financial
statements. $

maintenance of value of currency holdings under Article
25 (see Note D}, were charged or credited to income.

CAPITAL STOCK

The authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 722,057
shares of $10,000 par value each in terms of the United States
Dollar of the weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966.
This is equivalent to $8,710,534,620 in terms of current United
States Dollars.

The authorized capitel stock consists of “‘callable’’ capital
stock and “paid-in capital stock. The “‘callable’’ capital stock
is subject to call only as and when required by the Bank to meet
obligations incurred on borrowings or on guarantees. The
“paid-in capital stock is paid or payable partly in gold or
convertible currencies and partly in the currency of the member.
In lieu of the portion paid or payable in the currency of the
member, provided such currency is not required by the Bank
for the conduct of its operations, the Bank shall accept nonnegotiable, non-interest-bearing demand obligations in accordance with Article 6, paragraph 3.

As of 31 December 1977, the subscribed capital stock wes
$6,960,941,087 {$3.688,390,998 -— 1976). All matured
instalments amounting to $1,118,351,794 ($1,069,881,657 —
1976) were received except $253,334 due from Cambodia on
6 April 1975. Instalments not due aggregating $391,419,357
($112,594 677 — 1976) are receivable as follows:

Some members have made payments in respect of their capital
subscription instalments in advance of the due date. Such
payments are shown in the balance sheet (under the caption
“CAPITAL AND RESERVES") as "Advance payments on
subscriptions’’ pending the determination of the fuil value
cf such payments based on the rate of exchange to be used
by the Bank as of the date on which such payments are actually
due.

On 29 October 1976, the Board of Governors approved 6
proposal for a second general incresse of 135 per cent in the
authorized capital stock (from 307,257 shares valued at

APPENDIX 1-VIil

CONTINUED

I

$3,706,594 820 to 722,057 shares valued at $8,710,534.620).
This increase consists of 10 per cent “paid-in shares and 90
per cent “callable” shares. The “paid-in shares are required
to be paid for in four equal annual instalments commencing
in 1878, 40 per cent of each instatment being in convertible
currency and 60 per cent in the national currency of the
subscribing member. The increase became efiective on 30
September 1977 when subscriptions from members for shares
in excess of 240,000 shares were received by the Bank.

In April 1976, the Board of Governors of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) approved proposed amendments to its
Articles of Agreement which will become effective upon the
acceptance by 60 per cent of its members representing 80
per cent of its total voting power. As of 24 February 1978,
approximately 60 per cent of the members of the IMF
representing approximately 71 per cent of its total voting
power had accepted the amendments. Under these amendments, gold wii be abolished as a common denominator of tne
monetary system, currencies will no longer nave par values, and
all computations relating to currencies of IMF members for
the purpose of applying the provisions of the Articies of the IMF
will be made on the basis of the Special Drawing Right {SDR}.
Asa result, upon the effectiveness of the amendments to the MF
Articles, it will no longer be possible to determine, in current
monetary terms, the value of the unit in which the Bank's share
capital is denominated, namely, the United States Dollar of the
weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966. The Bank has
under consideraticn the effect of the !MF amendments on the
unit of denomination of its capital and the rights and obligations
of members with respect thereto. If the SDR were substituted
for the 1966 United States Dollar in the Bank’s Articles of
Agreement, the Bank’s capital stock would then consist of shares
having a par value of SDR 10,000 each, the value of which in
current monetary terms would vary from day to day
corresponding to variations in the current monetary value o7 the
SDR. Therefore, the Bank's capital stock, expressed in United
States Dollars, couid differ from the amounts shown in these
financial statements. }f such a substitution had been made as of
31 December 1977, the amounts for ‘‘callable’’ shares subscribed,
“paid-in” shares subscribed and total shares subscribed would
have been $5,488 900,000, $1 ,520.200,000 and $7,009,100,000,
respectively, as compared to $5,451,169,936, $1,509,771,151
and $6,960,941,087, respectively, shown in the financial statements. Such a substitution would not then have had a material
effect on the financial position or resufts of operations of the
Bank.

to the subsequent lean. Under such options. technical assistance

and credited to income of Ordinary Capital Resources during the
year ended 31 December 1977.

GENERAL

{b)

{ce}

(d)

Since 1967, the Bank has established Special Funds
Resources to finance the special operations of the Bank
as provided in Article 19 of the Articles of Agreement.
Such Special Funds Resources consist of a Technical
Assistance Speciai Fund and a Multi-Purpose Special
Fund,

In 1974, the Asian Development Fund was established,
Six contributors elected to have their contributions
to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund made after 31 December 1972 credited toward the amount of their contributions to the Asian Development Fund, Accordingly,
their contributions were transferred to the Asian Development Fund.

As a further step to streamline and restructure the
Special Funcs, transfer to the Asian Development Fund
of the resources in the Multi-Purpose Special Fund {with
the concurrence of the relevant contributor} was authorized in 1975. Accordingly, since 1 October 1975, all the
resources in the Multi-Purpose Special Fund, except a
portion of the contribution of Canada, the net income of
the Accrued Resources for the year ended 31 December
1977 and other credit, have been transferred to the Asian
Development Fund. 4

Since the Special Funds Rules and Regulations do not
apply to the Asian Development Fund, the accompanying
financial statements do not include the operations and
activities of that Fund.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

{a}

i a ne tA ltt dT NL i

Unit of Account ~

{b}

{c}

(d)

The Special! Funds Resources financial statements are
expressed in current United States Dollars,

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities and unexpended balances in currencies
other than United States Dollars were translated at the
applicable rates of exchange which prevaifed at the end
of the year.

Income and expense amounts in currencies other than
United States Dollars were translated for each quarter
generally at the applicable rates of exchange which
prevailed at the beginning of the quarter; such practice
approximates the application of average rates in effect
during the quarter,

Translation adjustments relating to funds representing
the unexpended balances of contributions were offset by
increases or decreases in the contribution accounts. Other
translation adjustments were charged or credited to income,

Contributions

Amounts contributed by member countries are included
in the financiai statements as contributions committed
from the date contribution agreements are signed and
related formalities are completed. As to those member
countries which have agreed to consider specific requests
for financing, the amounts shown in the financia} statements as contributions committed are based on the
specific requests approved through 31 December 1977
and 31 December 1976.

Restatement of Certain Amounts
Certain 1976 amounts have been restated to conform to
1977 classifications.

NOTE 3
FECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SPECIAL FUND

Since 1967, contributions have been made by 23 memberAPPENDIX 1-!

in i

countries to be used by the Bank for financing technical
assistance activities. In most cases. the initial use of the
contributions shall be for the procurement of expert
services and facilities from the contributing member
country. There has been, however, a trend towards
liberalization of the procurement terms, Therefore, some
of the contributions are substantially or wholly untied.

NOTE 4 —

MULTI-PURPOSE SPECIAL FUND

{a}

{b}

Since 1968, contributions have been made by 14 member
countries to be used by the Bank for financing special
operations {other than non-reimbursable technical assistance}. However, as 2 result of transfers of contributions
to the Asian Development Fund [see Notes 1(b) and 4
{c)] , a portion of the contribution of Canada is the only
contribution remaining in the Multi-Purpose Special Fund
at 31 December 1977.

The term "Accrued Resources’ refers to the resources
derived from the service fee charged by the Bank in its
special operations in accordance with the Special Funds
Rules and Regulations for the Bank's administration of
the Special Funds Resources and to certain other income
derived from Special Funds Resources credited, held and
administered by the Bank in the Multi-Purpose Special
Fund.

NOTE 5 —

LOANS.

Loans approved by the Bank on concessional terms are
classified as Special Funds loans. Where necessary and
when available, the resources of both the Multi-Purpose
Special Fund and the Asian Development Fund may be
used ejther singly or jointly, to finance such loans.
The amounts shown as “Effective loans held by Bank’
at 31 December 1977 represented only the portions

of loans outstanding which were disbursed trom the
resources remaining in the Multi-Purpose Special Fund.

NOTE 6 —

ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

An Administration Charge to Special Operations was
instituted in 1871. It is based on a formula which takes
into- consideration certain administrative expenses and
the number and amount of loans approved. Upon transfer
of the bulk of the resources to the Asian Development
Fund [see Notes 1{b) and 1 ic], the Administration
Charge Payable to Ordinary Capital Resources applicable
to such resources and contributions was also transferred,
resulting in a net credit arising from such transfer of the
liability.

NOTE 7 —

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

The outstanding commitments, as of 31 December 1977,
for technical assistance (services to member countries)
projects and programs approved by the Bank, were
approximately $10,101,000 ($7,182,000 — 1976}; to the
extent available, contributions to the Technical Assistance
Special Fund may be used to meet expenditures arising
out of the commitments. The amount shown is exclusive
of technical assistance services made available on a
reimbursable basis; however, when technical assistance
rendered as a part of the commitment shown leads to
loans for specific projects, the portion representing the
cost of design and engineering and any balance of
amount aver $150,000 ($100,000 prior to 31 May 1977)
will be converted to the subsequent loan. Under such
options, technical assistance expenditures of $475,344
($304,582 — 1976} were charged to loans and credited
to income of Special Funds Resources during the year
ended 31 December 1977.

In April 1973, the Board of Governors authorized the
establishment of a new Special Fund to be known as the
Asian Development Fund {the Fund). Subsequently,
the Board of Governors also authorized initial resource
mobilization arrangements for the Fund during the
three years ended 31 December 1975 under a two-stage
Programme providing for a total amount equivalent to
US$525,000,000. In April 1974, the Board of Directors
adopted Regulations for the administration of the Fund.
On 28 June 1974, the Fund was established when
Instruments of Contribution were deposited with the
Bank by ten contributors with contributions in an
aggregate amount exceeding the equivalent of
US$225,600,006, this being the minimum amount
required to establish the Fund.

Six contributors elected to have their contributions to the
Multi-Purpose Special Fund mace after 31 December
1972 credited toward the amount of their contributions
to the Fund, Accordingly, their contributions were
transferred to the Fund.

Three contributors have requested and the Board of
Directors has agreed, that the initial use of their
contributions in the First Stage, aggregating the
equivalent of US$105,038,559 at 31 December 1977
(US$104 940,935 — 1976) be restricted to procurement
of goods and services from their respective countries.
¢

Gn 30 June 1975, the Second Stage of the initia! resource
mobilization arrangements for the Fund became effective
when instruments of Contribution were deposited with
the Bank by 11 contributors with contributions in an
aggregate amount exceeding the equivalent of
US$94 000,006, this being the minimum amount required
to bring the Second Stage into effect.

As a further step to streamline and restructure the Special
Funds, transfer to the Fund of the resources in the MultiPurpose Special Fund (with the concurrence of the
relevant contributor} was authorized in 1975,
Accordingly, since 1. October 1975, the Set-Aside
Resources, the contributions of nine contributors, a

(f)

Portion of the contribution of Canada and the
accumulated net income of the Accrued Resources up to
31 December 1876 have been transferred from the MultiPurpose Special Fund to the Fund.

in December 1975, the Board of Governors authorized
the first replenishment arrangements for the Fund during
the three years ending 31 December 1978 under a threeinstalment programme providing for a total original
amount equivalent to US$830,000,000. On 28 June
1976, the first instalment of the first replenishment
arrangements became effective when Instruments of
Contribution were deposited with the Bank by eight
contributors with contributions in an aggregate amount
exceeding the equivalent of US$475,000,000, this being
the minimum amount required to bring the first instalment into effect. On 14 April 1977, the second instalment also became effective after payment of the revised

minimum amount equivalent to US$185,000,000 was
received,

NOTE 2 —

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

fa}

{b}

Unit of Account
The financial statements of the Fund are expressed in
current United States Dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities end unexpended balances in currencies
other than United States Dollars were translated at the
applicable rates of exchange which prevailed at the end
of the year. The capital stock of the Bank is defined
in Article 4, paragraph ¢ of the Articles of Agreement
in terms of the United States Dollar of the weight and
fineness in effect on 31 January 1966. Capital set-aside
was . therefore translated into current United States
Dollars on the basis of 1.20635 current dallars per 1966
dollar {see Note 3).

Income and expense amounts in currencies other than
United States Dollars were translated for each quarter
generally at the applicable rates of exchange which
prevailed at the beginning of the quarter; such practiceAPPENDIX 1-6

 

approximates the application of average rates in effect
during the quarter.

Translation adjustments relating to contributions were
offset by increases or decreases in the contribution
accounts. Translation adjustrnents relating to capita!
set-aside were recorded as receivable from or payable to
Ordinary Capital Resources. Other trans!ation adjustments were credited or charged to income.

{ce} Contributions
Amounts contributed by member countries are included
in the financial statements as contributions committed
from the date contribution agreements are signed and
related formalities are completed.

{d} Restatement of Certain Amounts
Certain 1976 amounts have been restated to conform
to 1977 classifications.

NOTE 3 -CAPITAL SET-ASIDE FOR SPECIAL OPERATIONS

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1{i}, the
Board of Governors has authorized the setting aside of 10 per
cent of the unimpaired ‘’paid-in” capital paid by members
pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(a) and of the convertible
currency portion paid by members pursuant to Article 6,
paragraph 2(b} as of 28 April 1973, to be used as part of the
Specia! Funds of the Bank. The resources so set aside, amounting
to $57,433,902 ($47,609,651 in terms of the United States
Doliar of the weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966),
were allocated and transferred to the Multi-Purpose Special
Fund. On 1 October 1975, these resources were transferred to
the Fund.

In April 1976, the Board of Governors of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) approved proposed amendments to its
Articles of Agreement which will become effective upon the
acceptance by 60 per cent of its members representing 80
per cent of its total voting power. As of 24 February 1978,
approximately 60 per cent of the members of the IMF
representing approximately 71 per cent of its total voting
power had accepted the amendments. Under these amendments,
gold will be abolished as a common denominator of the

 

monetary systern, currencies will no longer have per values, and
all computations relating ‘to currencies of IMF members for
the purpose of applying the provisions of the Articles of the IMF
will be made on the basis of the Special Drawing Right (SDR).
As a result, upon the effectiveness of the amendments to the IMF
Articles, it will no longer be possible to determine, in current
monetary terms, the value of the unit in which the Bank’s share
capital is denominated, namely, the United States Dollar of the
weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966. The Bank
has under consideration the effect of the IMF amendments
on the unit of ‘denomination of ‘its capital and the rights and
obligations of members with respect thereto. If the SDR were
substituted for the 1966 United States Dollar in the Sank’s
Articles of Agreement, the Bank's capital stock would then
cansist of shares having a par value of SOR 10,000 each, the
value of which in current monetary terms would vary from day
to day corresponding to variations in the current monetary
value of the SDR. Therefore, Capital Set-Aside for Special
Operations, expressed in United States Dollars, could differ
from the amount shown in these financial statements. If such a
substitution had been made as of 31 December 1977, Capital
Set-Aside for Special Operations would have been $57,832,000

as compared to $57 433,902 shown in the financial statements.
Such a substitution would not then have had a material effect on
the financial position or results of operations of the Fund.

NOTE 4 —

LOANS

Loans approved by the Bank on concessional terms are classified
as Spacial Funds loans. Where necessary and when available the
resources of both the Multi-Purpose Special Fund and the Fund
may be used either singly or jointly to finance such loans. The
Portions of foans allocated to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund,
representing disbursements in respect of individual loans made
from the resources remaining in that fund, are shown as an
adjustment to the Summary Statement of Loans.

NOTE 5 —

ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

An Administration Charge to Special Operations was instituted
in 1971. It is based on @ formula which takes into consideration
certain administrative expenses and the number and amount of
loans approved.

Our examinations were made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered
necessary in the CHCUNSIANEES:

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly the financial position of the Asian
Development Fund at 31 December 1877 and 31 December 1976 and the results of its operations and the
changes in its financial position for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis.

iN 1977 THE BANK maintained the rising tempo of its Jending and technical assistance activities, augmented its own capital resources and tapped important new sources of
development aid. Special efforts were made to help the poorest of its developing countries
(DMCs).

A detailed account of the Bank’s activities in 1977 appears later in the Report. Highlights are summarized below.

The Bank's capital resources were increased by 135 per cent — from $3,707 miltion to $8,711 million — with the coming into effect of the Second General Capital
Increase

Negotiations began with developed member countries for the second replenishment of the Asian Development Fund {ADF Ilf), to finance the Bank’s projected concessional lending program over the period 1979-1982

New loans approved from both ordinary capital and Special Funds resources totalled $887 million, an increase of 14.3 per cent on 1976

Total lending since 1968 passed the $4,000 million mark and cumulative disbursements reached $1,515 million

Technical assistance activities expanded sharply — 42 projects costing $7.2 million were approved, as against 24 projects costing $4.6 million in 1976; preparations were made for further expansion, designed especially to accelerate investment in DMCs and also to attract project financing from other sources

The Agriculture and Agto-Industry sector received 29 per cent of total lending and
nearly 60 per cent of concessional lending; the percentage shares of other sectors
were: Power — 25; Transport and Communications — 16; Industry (including
Development Banks} — 16; Water Supply and Urban Development — 12; and
Education — 2

ECONOMIC BACKGROUND

International Setting

DURING 1977 THE wortd.economy continued to recover,
although at a modest pace, from the severe recession experienced in 1974 and 1975. The overall growth in Gross
National Product (GNP) was substantially lower than that
attained in 1976. World trade increasedin volume by only 5

per cent, compared with 11 per cent in 1976. The results .

for the year were affected by the difficulties encountered by
many countries in reducing high rates of inflation and
unemployment, the generally depressed levels of investment, and serious imbalances in the external accounts of
major trading countries, leading to unstable exchange
rates.

On the other hand, the output of foodgrains was ata high
level for the third consecutive year; the worid stock’ af cereais increased from about 124 million metric tons (m.t.} in
4976 to about 160 million m.t. in 1977. As a result, the
global food situation has improved considerably since the
early 1970s, this has helped to contain inflationary pressures,

The aggregate GNP, in real terms, of the industrial couniries which are members of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation: and Development (OECD) is estimated to
have increased by 3.6 per cent in 1977, as against 5.2 per
cent in 1976. In several major industrial countries, inflation
and unemployment levels remained high, the policy
measures adopted to contain inflation generally affected
ihe pace of economic recovery. The aggregate current
account deficit of the OECD ccuntries during 1977
($32,000 million) was substantially larger than in 1976
{$26,500 million), Moreover, the distribution of the
increased deficit among these countries was more
uneven. Some OECD countries resorted to restrictions on
certain imports on grounds of severe external imbalances
and persisting unemployment.

The oil-exporting (OPEC) developing countries continued to sustain high levels of investment and fairly rapid
rates of economic growth in 1977, although some slowing
down occurred as several of these countries faced bottlenecks in implementing their expanding development programs. The aggregate current account surplus of the oilexporting countries declined marginally from $42,300 million in 1976 to about $40,000 million in 1977. This surplus
accrued largely to a few countries, whose capacity to
absorb imports remains comparatively small. On the other
hand, some of the more populous countries had to accept
sizeable current account deficits in supporting their

1 Tote: carryover of cereals (exctuding the People's Reoublic of China and
U.S.S.R,} estimated by the Food ang Agriculture Organization (FAQ).

development programs.

There are indications that most of the non-oil developing
countries were able to sustain fairly satisfactory rates of
increase in their GNP in 1977, although the aggregate rate
is likely to fall short of the 5.4 per cent rate achieved in
1976. This performance was accompanied by continuing
high current account deficits — $45,400 million in 1977
compared to $44,000 million in 1976." While the total foreign exchange reserves of the non-oil developing
countries continued to increase in 1977, the improvement
was largely accounted for by a few countries and was
made possible by inflows of capital which exceeded their
combined current account deficit.

The economic prospects for 1978 of the world economy
appear, on the whole, to be less promising than in the previous two years. Due to unfavorable weather, the production of foodgrains in the 1978 crop year? is expected
to be below the ievel attained in 1977. On the basis of the
policies and economic situation prevailing at the end of
1977, the oyerall growth rate of OECD countries for 1978
was forecast at3.5 per cent.? Unless higher rates of growth
are achieved by major industrial countries, nat only will
they continue to experierice unsatisfactory leveis of unemployment but also the growth of world trade will be
retarded, and many developing countries, especially those
that are highly export-oriented, will suffer as a result.
Increased restraints on imporis by industrial countries
could further affect exports of manufactured goods by developing countries, resulting in larger deficits in their external accounts. According to OECD estimates, the aggregate current account deficit of non-oil developing countries
is expected to increase substantially from $45,400 mittion
in 1977 to $59,006 million in 1978 — alevel which would be
difficult to sustain.

To maintain their growth momentum, the developing
countries will have to intensify their efforts to mobilize
higher domestic savings, exploit domestic natural resources, increase efficiency in industrial and agricultural
production and expand exports both of traditional and nontraditional items. The success of these efforts will greatly
depend upon the extent to which the major industrial countries reflate their economies, maintain growth in their imports from developing countries and also raise the level of
their external assistance.

LOGGING in Burma, where the Bank’s first Forestry

Project will contribute to better use of the country’s
timber resources,Economic Developments in the Region

in terms of severa! majos indicators, such as growth in
real incomes, food production, export earnings and foreign
exchange reserves, the economic performance in 1977 of
the developing member countries {DMCs} of the Bank, on
the whole, gave cause for satisfaction. However, jower
rates of growth in GNP were experienced by many DMCs,
largely because the sharp rate of increase in production
achieved in 1976, particuiarly in industry, was not sustained in 1977. Also, inflation rates, which had abated considerably in 1978, generally moved upward during 1977.

On the basis of preliminary estimates tor 13 DMCs listed
in Table 1,’ it seems that rates of growth In reat Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) were generally satisfactory in
1977. In Burma, Fiji, Singapore and Sri Lanka the rates improved from 6 per cent, 2.6 per cent, 6.8 per cent and 3 per
centin 1976 to 6.6 per cent, 4 per cent, 7.5 percent and 4.5
per cent, respectively, in 1977. Ih each of these countries,
a general improvement occurred in ail major economic
sectors. In Indonesia, despite its poor performance in the
agricultural sector, the rate remained steady at around 7
per cent. In the Philippines the rate declined from 7.3 per
cent in 1976 to 5.8 per cent in 1977, reflecting slower
growth in agriculture, manufacturing and construction activities and continued low prices for some important export

products. in Thailand also the rate declined from 8.2 per
cent in 1976 to 6.2 per cent in 1977. in most of the more
industrialized and economically advanced DMCs' —
Republic of China, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea and
Mataysia — there was a decline. However, GDP growth
tates for this group ranged from 7.7 per cent to 11.6 per
cent, Though impressive by international standards, these
were below the high rates achieved in 1976 when the
region as a whole benefited from the sharp recovery of the
world economy from the relatively depressed conditions
prevailing in 1975.

Bangladesh and Pakistan experienced considerably
lower growth rates during 1977. In Bangladesh, agricultural production, on which the economy is heavily dependent, felt somewhat from the level achieved in 1976. As a
result, the overail growth rate declined, despite improved
performance in the non-agricultural sectors. In Pakistan,
manufacturing output declined sfightly in 1977, as ithad in
the previous two years, due mainly to a deterioration in the
business climate and shortages of raw materials, including
cotton, Moreover, heavy losses oceurredin the agricultural
sector due to severe ficods. As a result, the overall growth
rate in 1877 was negligiole.

Of the DMCs for which national income data for 1977 are
not yet available, production statistics for certain major
sectors suggest that India may have achieved an increase
in real income of around 5 per cent, which is much higher
than that for 1976, due to a bumper food crop and growihin
production in other sectors, The growth rate of Nepal is
expected to remain more or less at the 4 per cent level
achieved in 1976. In Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam,
floods and prolonged droughi seriously affected their agricultural production and, consequently, their overall GDP
growth rates must have suffered. In respect of the Pacific
countries, the information available on production and
international prices of their principal exports indicates that
they achieved a moderate growth in real income during
1977, with the exception of Giibert Islands, which was
affected by reduced prices for its principal export
{phosphate}.

Overall agricultural production in the region in 1977
showed a substantial improvement over 1976. However,
the performance of individual DMCs varied widely. Some
of the predominantly agricultural countries (Bangladesh,
Lao Peapie’s Democratic Republic and Socialist Repubtic
of Viet Nam) experienced unfavorable weather, which
resulted in reduced output. However, in many other DMCs
(Republic of China, India, Republic of Korea, Malaysia
and Nepal), agricultural production increased, due both to
favorable weather and continued improvements in development efforts in this sector.

During 1975-1977 considerable gains were made in
food security. Production of foodgrains (rice, wheat and
maize) in the region declined marginally from the record
level of 222 million m.t. achieved in 1975 to 218 million m.t.
in 1976. For 1977 a new record of 231 miflion m,t. has been
estimated — 6 per cent more than in 1976 (Tables 2 and
3)? As a result, food stocks in many countries have
reached high tevels. For the DMCs as a whole, food im

posts fell from 20.7 million m.t. in 1976 to 19.2 million m.t. in
1977, of which an increased proportion was met from
surpluses within the region.

Among the foodgrains, the greatest gain was made in
the output of rice, the staple food of the majority of the population in the region. Total rice production in the DMCs
increased trom 158 million m.t. in 1976 to 172 million m.t. in
1977, exceeding the previous record of 168 million m.t. set
in 1975. Wheat production also was at a record level —
about 42 million m.t. Maize productién, which declined in
1976, faited to improve in 4977.

Preliminary data for ten DMCs, including most of the
more industrialized countries, reveal that, with the exception of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, the expansion in industrial production slowed down in 1977. The deceleration in
growth rates was very sharp in the Republic of China (from
24.9 per cent in 1976 to 11.2 per cent in 1977}, India
(from 10.9 per cent to 5.8 per cent), the Republic of Korea
(from 33.2 per cent to 14.1 per cent) and the Philippines
(from 4.9 per cent to 3.3 per cent). This deterioration was
due largely to sluggishness in domestic demand and a
slowing down in the growth of exports to industrial
countries. Restraints on exports of textiles was ah important factor in the latter regard. New investment in manufacturing industries also remained generally depressed
during the year.

Within the industrial sector, however, production of fossil
fuels made significant gains. The output of crude petrofeum in five DMCs (Burma, India, Indonesia, Malay
sia and Pakistan) increased by 11.8 per cent from 92.1
million m.t. in 1976 to 103 million m.t. in 1977. Even excluding Indonesia (which is a member of OPEC) the increase
was 10.5 per cent — from 18.1 million m.t. in 1976 to 20
million m.t. in 1977. Production of natural gas also
increased substantially during the year — mostly in indonesia, which is the major producer of natural gas in the
region.

The DMCs succeeded, on average, in containing inflation in 1977 to about the same rate asin the previous year
(Table 4). Excluding India, which has a very large relative
weighting and which experienced considerable swings in
price movements in each of the past three years, the
weighted average rate of consumer price increases in 21
DMCs fell from 13.5 per cent in 1975 to 8.4 per centin 1976
and to 8 per cent in 1977. This overall performance was
much better than in the developing world as a whole and
was about the same as the average rate of inflation in
OECD countsies in 1977. Price changes experienced by
India during the same period were 6.6 per cent in 1975,
minus 7.7 per cent in 1976 and 8.5 per cent in 1977.

While the average rate of inflation was slightly less than
in 1976, the number of countries which experienced higher
inflation in 1977 was much greater than the number which
experienced the reverse (Table 4}, The causes of inflationary pressures varied from country to country. In those
industrialized DMCs which experienced higher price increases, the boostin monetary demand came largely from
increases in international reserves and expansionaryfinancial policies pursued to sustain the rate of growth in
GNP. The higher rate of inflation in some of the agricultural
DMCs was mainly attributable to shortages due to poor
performance of the agricultural sector. A general factor
exerting upward pressure on prices in all DMCs was the
continued high rate of inflation in the world economy. Any
further major improvement in the situation in the region in
this regard wilf therefore depend on greater price stabilization in world markets.

In the sphere of international trade, the aggregate merchandise trade deficit of the DMCs substantiaily increased
from $5,000 million in 1976 to $5,700 million in 1977, The
data on exports, imports and trade balances givenin Table
5 show that some countries experienced a substantial improvement over 1976. Important among these countries
were the Republic of Korea, the Philippines and Singapore, all of which experienced considerably reduced trade
deficits in 1977; the Republic of China, whose trade surplus increased; and india, whose previous small trade deficit was converted into a surplus. However, these improvements were more than offset by larger trade deficits (or
reduced surpluses} recorded by several other DMCs.
Notable among the countries which increased their deficits
in 1977 were Hong Kong, whose deficit more than dou-~
bied; Thailand, whose deficit nearly doubled; and Pakistan, whose large trade deficit increased further to a record
level of $1,300 million. Among the surplus countries, Indonesia’s favorable balance was reduced by almost

two-thirds, while Malaysia also experienced a substantial
reduction in its trade surplus.

It may be noted that the four more industrialized DMCs
and India reduced their aggregate trade deficit from $3,000
tmiilion in 1976 to $2,000 million in 1977 (Table 5}. On the
other hand, the remaining DMCs experienced a deterioration of $1,700 million in their balance of trade — their
overall deficit increasing from $2,000 million in 1976 to
$3,700 million in 1977. For the four more industrialized
OMCs and India, exports — particularly of manufactured
goods — increased at a much faster rate than imports; for
the remaining DMCs, export performance failed to keep
pace with the growth in imports.

Overall, exports of DMCs increased in value by about
49.5 per cent in 1877. Although below the level achieved in
1876 (34 per cen), this was higher than the aggregate
growth in world exports (estimated at 11 per ceni). it was
made possible by both an improvement in the unit prices of
major export items and higher export volumes. This
enabled the DMCs to provide for their import requirements
somewhat more liberally than in the past. Aggregate imports increased by 19 per cent in 1977, as compared with
41 per centin 1976. This was also substantially higher than
the growth in world imports, reflecting the growing share of
DMCs in world trade.

Data on the direction of trade flows of DMCsin 1976, the
Jatest year for which such figures are avaiiabie, show that

1976 E__j 1977the United States, Japan and Western Europe were the
largest export markets, absorbing 24.3 per cent, 19.1 per
cent and 18.7 per cent, respectively, of the exports from
DMCs. These three markets were also the most important
sources of imports, accounting for 16.9 per cent, 23.2 per
cent and 15.7 per cent, respectively, of DMCs’ total imports. intra-regional trade was nextin importance, absorbing 17.2 per cent of the region's exports arid supplying
15.4 per cent of its imports in 1976. The only major development in the direction of trade in recent years has been
the emergence of the Middle East countries as trading
partners. Imports from these countries increased from 5.4
per cent of the total imports of DMCs in 1972 to 14 per cent
in 1976; DMC exports to these countries increased similarly from 2.6 per cent of their total exports in 1972 to S.6 per
cent in 1976. Over the same period several DMCs,
including india, the Republic of Korea, Pakistan and the
Philippines benefited from a substantial increase in remittances from their nationals working in Middle East
countries.

Indices of the terms of trade in 1977, available for eight
DMCs, show animprovement for four countries, a deterioration for three, and no change for one country. For several
countries, the terms of trade, with 1972 as the base year,
remained at very low levels during 1977. For Bangladesh,
the index stood at 53 — the same as in 1976. For the Republic of China, the index declined from 90 in 1976 to 86in
1977. For the Philippines, the index has deteriorated every
year since 1974, standing at 71 in 1977. For the Republic
of Korea, the index rose, but was still only 83 in 1977. lmprovements over the base year occurred only for Malaysia,
Pakistan and Singapore; their indices in 1977 reaching
114, 102 and 105, respectively.

The aggregate international reserves of the DMCs continued to increase during 1977, although at a somewhat
slower rate than in 1976. Data available for 19 OMCs
{Table 6} show that their combined reserves increased
from $20,300 million at the end of 1976 to $25,800 million
by November/December 1977. Aggregate reserves rose
from the equivalent of 3.4 months’ imports in 1975 to 4.6
months’ imports in 1976 and again to 4.9 months’ imports
in 1977. However, most of this increase was experienced
by five DMCs — India, indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Singapore. Of the rest, some had to draw down
their reserves to meet their current deficits while for others
the gain in reserves was modest.

Despite the DMCs’ success in containing the level of
their trade deficits in 1976 and 19877 much below the high
levels prevailing in 1974 and 1975, external debt seems to
have continued to grow at a rapid pace. The data
presented in Table 7 show that, for 17 DMCs," total public
debt outstanding increased by 19 per cent — from $33,400
million to $39,700 million — between 1974 and 1975, and
by a further 18 per cent to $46,900 million in 1976.
Although no comprehensive data are available for 1977,
there are indications that the external public debt of DMCs
might have increased by about the same amount as in
1976. Debt-service payments in 1976 (the latest year for
which data are available) were higher than in 1975. However, due to increased exports, the aggregate debt-service
ratio, on the whole, declined from 6.2 per cent in 1975 to
5.9 per cent in 1976 (Table 7).

Domestic Efforts and Policies

The satisfactory economic performance recorded, by
many DMCs in recent years is largely attributable to the
pragmatic responses of the governments concerned to the
changed international economic situation resulting from
the events of the mid-1970s. In 1975 most DMCs sustained their growth targets, even though this invoived
sharp increases in external deficits and domestic price
levels. The expansionary economic policies pursued at
that time contributed in a modest way to cushioning the
severity of the international recession. In 1976, as the
recovery of the world economy began to exert expansionary impulses on their exports and economic growth,
the DMCs adopted stabilization measures which, on
the whole, were successtul in curtailing inflation and
sustaining relatively high GNP growth rates, as well as in
reducing their trade deficits. In 1977, in view of the slowdown in international economic recovery, several DMCs
resorted to expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to
sustain their economic growth, while generally keeping intlation rates within manageable limits. Towards this end, a
number of governments increased taxes and/or reduced
subsidies and also adopted selective credit policies.
Nevertheless, many DMCs continued to suffer from inadequate domestic savings to finance their investment programs.

The DMCs generally continued to pursue policies designed to realize the objective of increasing self-reliance.
In respect of socio-economic priorities, more attention
was devoted to rural development, the narrowing of regional imbalances and the encouragement of production to
meet basic human needs. The emphasis placed on
increasing production of foodgrains was maintained, since
in the past imports of foodgrains had accounted for the
major drain on foreign exchange resources of many — and
in particular the poorer — DMCs. The record level of
foodgrains production in the region in 1977, despite adverse weather in some countries, attests to the vigorous
efforts being made by DMCs to improve agricultural
productivity.

The need to reduce the incidence of urban unemployment and rural underemployment, while economizing on
the use of capital resources, led the more populous DMCs
to search for effective methods of promoting small-scale
industries and development projects employing indigenous technologies because of their valuable impact on
employment generation. Efforts to develop indigenous
energy resources were also intensified. In several DMCs
family planning measures received added emphasis,
including budgetary allocations.

During the year several DMCs undertook measures designed to make their exports more competitive to stimulate private investment and to attract farger foreign capital
inflows through the adoption of realistic exchange rates
and the provision of fiscal and other incentives. A greater
emphasis on liberal trade policies aimed at the expansion
of both exports and imports was perceptible in public pronouncements, as well as in the policy changes made in @
number of DMCs. The relatively good export performance
and the availability of external resources to finance current
account deficits helped in the adoption of such policies.

Regional Cooperation
During 1977 several initiatives were taken to foster bila-10

teral and multiiateral economic cooperation among DMCs.
Members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) granted tariff concessions on a large number of
items in intra-regional trade. A swap facility of $100 million
was ratified by ASEAN members in August to help bridge
temporary international liquidity problems. Further progress was made during the year towards integrating the
economic infrastructure of ASEAN countries, notable
among which was the allocation of certain major industries
on the basis of regional specialization. Discussions were
also held on the establishment of a regional shipping service and a pooling of expertise in port services and
management.

The Asian Clearing Union, established in November
1975, handied an appreciably highér volume of transactions in 1977, amounting to 68 million Asian Monetary
Units (AMU) as compared to 22.6 milion AMU in 1976. It
was also decided to extend the settlement period for
unpaid balances accumulated by participating countries
from one month to two months. Progress was made with

PUSRI ii fertilizer plant near Paiembang, South Sumatra,
indonesia, where production of urea has been expanded from
100,000 tons to 480,000 tans annually with Bank assistance.

 

respect to the establishment of institutions under the sponsorship of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific (ESCAP}, such as a Regional Centre for
the Development of Indigenous Technology in Asia and
the Asian institute for Broadcasting Development, in which
most DMCs will participate.

South Asian countries took further steps to improve cooperation in that sub-region. An important development
was the treaty between India and Bangladesh on the sharing of the waters of the River Ganges. india and Nepal
agreed to strengthen their economic cooperation and
decided to execute expeditiously several projects in order
to exploit for their mutual benefit the water resources of
four major rivers flowing from Nepal to India. They aiso
agreed to execute appropriate trade and transit treaties
Trade relations between india and Pakistan continued to
improve during the year.

Significant developments occurred in 1977 in cooperation among the Pacific countries. Through the efforts of the
South Pacific Bureau for Economic Cooperation — the
economic arm of the South Pacific Forum (SPF} — anc the
South Pacific Commission, eight countries entered into an
agreement in June to explore the possibility of establishing
a regional shipping line. in August the SPF decided to establish a South Pacific Regional Fishing Agency for controlling the expicitation of fishery resources. All DMCs in
the Pacific are participating in these two cooperative
arrangements.

Developments in International Cooperation

Between 1974 (when the current deficits of DMCs
surged upward) and 1976 there was a steady increase in
the flow of external resources’ to the region, from $10,000
million in 1974 to $14,300 million in 1976 (Table 8). Most of
this increase was in non-concessional official and private
capital inflows. Concessionai aid inflows actually registered a decline. Official Development Assistance (ODA)
from the Development Assistance Committee (DAC)
countries and multilateral institutions combined, which increased from $4,800 million in 1974 to $5,300 miffion in
1975, declined to $4,400 million in 1976. This has particularly affected the poorer countries, which cannot afford
the alternative of borrowing at market terms.

No firm estimates of the total flow of external resources
to the region during 1977 are yei available. However, a
rough estimate based on data relating to trade deficits,
preliminary figures of net receipts from services and
private transfers, and movements in international reserves, suggests that net capital inflows in 1977 may have
been at the level of 1976. While net official assistance is
expected to be higher than in 1976, there was an offsetting
decline in private export credits, bond issues and Eurocurrency credits,

Several important measures were initiated during 1977
which either have contributed to increasing the availability
of external resources to DMCs or will assist in doing so in
future. First, the international Fund for Agricultural Development ({FAD), which has an initia! capital of approximately $1,000 million, became operational. by the end of the
year. Its primary objective is to help developing countries

1 Other than the flow from centrally planned economies, for which complete data
are not available.increase their food production. The poorest food-deficit
developing countries will be eligible for “special loans”
from IFAD which will carry a service charge of 1 per cent
per annum and be repayable over 50 years, Second, the
Trust Fund established by the IMF in May 1976 from the
proceeds of its gold auctions commenced operations. The
Fund wili be used to provide special balance-of-payments
support for eligible developing countries on‘concessional
terms. Third, a temporary Supplementary Financing
Facility amounting to $10,000 million was created by the
iMF to help member countries meet their urgent
balance-of-payments needs. Fourth, the Fifth Replenishment of the International Development Association ({DA
V}, amounting to $7,600 million for the three-year period
4977/78 to 1979/80, was approved by member countries
of the World Bank, This will enable IDA to increase
considerably its concessional lending, of which the DMCs
of the Bank can expect to receive a substantial share.

During the year developing countries continued to place
great emphasis on efforts to stabilize commodity prices, to
improve access to worid markets, to diversify and expand
the loca! processing of primary commodities, and to modernize the marketing and distribution systems for such
goods, with a view to expanding merchandise trade in
order to stimutate economic growth.

At the final Ministerial-level Meeting of the Conference
on International Economic Cooperation (C!IEC} held in
Paris in May-June 1977, while severa! issues remained
unresolved, there were also some concrete results. The
industrial countries agreed to a $1,000 million Special
Action Program to meet the needs of the poorest developing countries. Agreement in principle was aiso reached on
the establishment.of a Common Raw Materials Fund with
further negotiations on modalities to take place in the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
Meanwhife, several existing specific commodity arrangements (e.g., wheat, tin, sugar, coffee and cocoa)
are helping to improve the operations of commodity
markets for the benefit of both developing and developed
countries.

On the initiative of the World Bank, a new Internationat
Commission on Development Issues was set up under the
chairmanship of former Chancellor Willy Brandt of the Federal Republic of Germany to consider the major international issues confronting the world today, including
those discussed by CIEC, and to suggest solutions which
may be of long-run interest and benefit to both developed
and developing countries. Several eminent Asians are
included among the 16 members of the Commission
chosen by the Chairman.

There was further progress during the year in the development of an action program to eradicate world hunger. in
June, the United Nations World Food Council approved a
22-point International Action Program to solve the problem
of world hunger and mainutrition. This called for, among
other things, a substantial increase in economic assis
tance to expand food production in developing countries,
and the establishment of an international food reserve
system for wheat and possibly other foodgrains, including
rice. Follow-up action on such a world food program will
have a significant impact on the eradication of hunger and
malnutrition, the incidence of which still remains heavily
concentrated in DMCs of the Bank.

A central problem of development facing DMCs is that
the vast majority of their population live in “absolute
poverty”. The Declaration on Relations with Developing
Countries adopted by OECD member governments in
June acknowledged the necessity to continue working
towards improved and more effective development cooperation policies aimed at fostering growth in incomes
and meeting basic human needs in developing countries.
in particular, these governments expressed their determination to assist developing countries which seek to
expand their own capabilities to meet more effectively the
basic needs of their people, within the context of achieving
self-sustaining growth.

The Bank remained responsive to the varied and changing requirements of its DMCs and expanded subsiantially
both the size and range of its loan andtechnical assistance
operations during 1977. Particular attention was devoted
to efforts to promote an increased flow of official development assistance to the region. For this purpose, the
Bank, in addition to maintaining and expanding ‘existing arrangements, entered into new cooperative and
co-financing agreements with the EEC and the OPEC
Special Fund, and made considerable progress in arriving
at similar arrangements with IFAD.

The amount of concessional tending by the Bank to
poorer countries increased substantially in 1977, and within tt the already high share of loans for agriculture and
agro-industries was further increased. Special emphasis
was given to integrated rural development projects, which
aimed at directly reaching the marginal farmers and the
rural poor, and to the creation of additional non-farm rurat
employment opportunities. This emphasis accords with
the recommendations in the Second Asian Agricultural
Survey‘ undertaken by the Bank. The use of appropriate
technology and income and employment aspects were
given careful consideration in the selection and formulation of projects. The search for innovative and challenging projects led the Bank into new areas of activity.
Measures aimed at furthering local institution- building and
improving the project implementation capabilities of DMCs
through an expanded technical assistance program were
introduced.

During the year the Bank's Second General Capital !ncrease became effective and initial steps were taken in the
mobilization of additional Special Funds resources to
enable the Sank to carry out its concessional lending
program in future. These, and other efforts, are dealt with
in subsequent chapters of this Report.

ahOPERATIONS AND POLICIES

Lending Operations

THE BANK achieved steady growth inits assistance to the
region in 1977. Project loans totalled $887 million, nearly
one-third of which was on concessional terms to the poorer
countries. Significant advances were made in co-financing
and in cooperation generally with other aid agencies.
Technical assistance expanded sharply, much of it designed to increase the capacity of the poorer countries to
accelerate their development efforts. Special attention
was given to improving loan implementation and to
strengthening the social impact of project loans.

A total of 45 loans for 45 projects in 16 developing member countries (DMCs) was approved during the year,
compared to 37 loans for 36 projects in 16 DMCs in 1976.
At $887 million, totat lending represented an increase of
14.3 per cent’ over the previous year’s total of $776 million.

Loans from ordinary capital resources amounted to

$615 million, an increase of 13.9 per cent over the 1976

total of $540 million.

Despite uncertainties about the availability of resources,
Special Funds loans amounted to $272 million, an
increase of 15.3 per cent over the 1976 total of $236
million, and 96 per cent of this amount wentto DMCs with a
1975 per capita GNP of less than $200.

Seven DMCs received loans exclusively from ordinary
capital resources, namely, Hong Kong ($20.5 million),
Indonesia ($136 million), Republic of Korea ($135.2 million}, Malaysia ($43.3 million), Papua New Guinea ($17.7
milion}, Philippines ($147 million) and Thailand ($47
million).

Eight DMCs received loans exclusively from Special
Funds, namely, Afghanistan ($14.7 million), Bangladesh
($84.8 million), Burma ($25.1 million), Nepal ($23.5 million), Solomon Islands ($5.6 million}, Sti Lanka ($41.5 miloe Tonga ($370,000) and Western Samoa ($5.3 miiion).

Pakistan received loans totalling $139 million from both
ordinary capital resources ($68 million) and Special Funds
($71 miltion).

The Bank continued to pay special attention to its small
Pacific Island DMCs, which received a record number of

JUTE mill in Nepal, one of several being modernized

seven loans totafling $29 million during the year. Five of
these loans were from Special Funds and four were also
formulated under technical assistance previously provided
by the Bank. Special attention was given to supporting
efforts to expand productive capacity, both export-oriented
and import-substitutive, and to the extension andimprovement of economic infrastructure. The total of Bank loans to
OMCs in this sub-region now totals 24 for $91 million.

Loan approvals during the year inciuded four supplementary loans totalling $69.4 million.’ Two of these loans,
trom ordinary capital resources and amounting to $61 million, went to Indonesia ($23 million) and Pakistan ($38 million}, while two from Special Funds {totalling $8.4 million)
went to Nepal. One technical assistance loan, for $1.7 million, was approved for a feasibility study and preparation of
detailed designs and tender documents for the expansion
of a large power generation plantin the Republic of Korea.

The average size of loans approved in 1977 decreased
slightly to $19.7 million, or $20.4 million if the supplementary and engineering foans are excluded, compared to $21
million and $23.6 million, respectively, in 1976. The decrease was due to the approval of 12 smalter loans totalling $49.5 million from Special Funds to Afghanistan,
Nepal, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Western Samoa. The
smatlest loan for the year was $370,000 trom Special
Funds for the Smail Industries Center Project in Tonga; the
largest was $47 million from ordinary capital resources for

the Third Power Project in Thailand. The largest Special .

Funds loan was $39.5 million for the Faisalabad Water
Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Project in Pakistan.

The total cost of projects approved in 1977, excluding
development finance institution (DFI) projects, is estimated at $1,738 million, of which Bank financing accounted
for 46 per cent. The subloans in the three loans to DFls
have not yet been’ fully identified, but on the Bank's past
experience, the total costs of the projects financed by
these three loans could be expected to reach about $395
million.

By the end of the year the Bank’s cumulative tending had
reached $4,246 million for 309 projects in 23 DMCs. Of
this, loans totalling $3,079 million were made from ordinary

cost financing is expected to be undertaken in 1978.

In project formulation, the Bank has sought opportunities to apply appropriate technology, taking into account
the typical features of the economies of DMCs, such as
their predominantly agricultural base, low per capita
incomes and wages, high fevels of unemployment and
abundant supplies of labor with varying degrees of skill. A
review was made during the year of the Bank's experience

application of these techniques inits project loans in future.

The Bank also continued its aim of eliciting the maximum
social benefit from its project loans, especially in the agricultural sector, where many opportunities exist for applying labor-intensive methods.

Following the completion of a review of its methodologies for economic and financial appraisal, social costbenefit and social equity analyses are being gradually
introduced into appraisals for Bank-assisted projects,
initially on a selective and experimental basis. Further
studies have, been: organized towards formulating appropriate guidelines in this field for operational use.

Co-Financing

The Bank has continued to seek opportunities for
co-financing, both with traditional aid-donors from inside
and outside its membership, and with existing and newly
established international organizations.

Co-financing enables the Bank to maximize its catalytic
rolein encouraging greater investmentin the region. A key
factor in the process of co-financing is the expertise
already developed by the Bank in project appraisal and implementation. The willingness of other donors to join in
co-financing enhances the impact of the Bank’s own
financial and technical resources.

1976. Thelinks created with the newly established International Fund for Agricultural Development are expected to

. lead to additional opportunities for co-financing in the near

future. Cooperation with member countries in bilateral
co-financing continued, and this led to the completion of
co-financing arrangements with Canada and New Zealand
in three of the loan projects approved in 1977. A formal
co-financing agreement with Norway was completed in
August. The groundwork was also laid during the year for
co-financing of other projects in future.

Altogether, co-financing arrangements were approved
for eight Bank-financed projects during the year. The
various co-financers provided more than $56 million in all,
the Bank's share was $111 million and the total cost of the
projects involved was estimated at $438 million.

Since the first co-financing arrangement in 1970,
co-financing has been arranged for 29 projects, for which
the Bank has provided $567 million and other donors $664
million.

Sectoral Activities

The Bank's operations in 1977 again reflected the high
priority placed by DMCs on the agricultural sector and a
continuing attention to infrastructure, particularly those of
high social content, such as water supply and urban development. The Agriculture and Agro-industry sector received 29 per cent of total lending, followed by Power, 25
per cent; Transport and Communications, 16 per cent,
Industry {including Development Banks), 16 per cent,
Water Supply and Urban Development, 12 per cent; and
Education, 2 per cent.

The Bank's strategy for agricultural assistance has
placed emphasis on an integrated approach to rural development, land utilization, water management and expansion of rural employment, as a means of dealing with the
persisting problems of unemployment and underemployment, poverty and mainutrition among the rural population
in DMCs. in addition to raising productivity and Increasing
food supplies, this integrated approach has also been
used as the main vehicle to bring about general improvements in the quality of life of the rural masses. The Bank
has stressed the need for creating conditions in rural areas
which encourage greater use of techniques that are appropriate to local resource ‘availabilities, including organizational capacity and managerial skills, and which
strengthen and improve existing institutions so that they
can operate more efficiently and equitably. The Bank has
supported efforts to encourage socially underprivileged and
economically deprived segments of the rural population to
form themselves into groups which, by facilitating their
involvement in economic activity, increases the scope of
rural dévelopment and improves the share of the poor in
productivity gains. Provision has been made in the Bank's
agricultural projects for farmer training centers, and pilot
schemes to demonstrate better water management and
other improved cultivation methods.

The Bank's agricultural development strategies have
been guided by surveys and sectoral reviews undertaken
from time to time, The Second Asian Agricultural Survey
was finalized during the year and the report on the Survey
was circulated to member governments. (A summary ofits
findings may be found on the opposite page.)

’ The Bank approved 16 loans totalling $259.7 million to
the Agriculture and Agro-industry sector in 1977, compared to 12 for $200.9 million in 1976. These inctuded ten
loans amounting to $196.4 miftion for irrigation and land
development projects. For the first time, the Bank provided

projects amounting to $21.6 million, a fertilizer and
agrochemicals storage project for $6.7 million and an agricultural credit project for $6 million were also approved.

An exampie of the integrated development approach
referred to above is the Nakdong River Basin Development Project in the Republic of Korea, which includes provision for flood contro! and irrigation works, warehouses,
small power tillers and extension services. The Second
Pahang Tenggara Regional Development Project in
Malaysia will assist in developing the whole of the Pahang
Tenggara region through the provision of access roads,
water supply schemes, housing units and commercial infrastructure. The Chashma Right Bank Irrigation Projectin
Pakistan will provide irrigation canals, drainage, service
roads, agricultural support services and consultant services, and is expected to benefit 23,000 farm families. The
Tago River Irrigation Project in the Philippines, apart from
providing irrigation and infrastructure works, includes rural
water supply and health facilities. Expansion of irrigation
facilities in the dry zone in the Hambantota district in Sri
Lanka through the Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement
Project will develop uncultivated dry areas into productive
farm tands, and also foster new ‘settlements through the
provision of basic infrastructure.

In the fisheries sub-sector, the Aquaculture Devetopment Project in Bangladesh, besides helping to meet the
protein requirements of an estimated 3.7 million people,
will employ labor-intensive methods of construction, which
are expecied to generate nine millicn man-days of
employment for unskilled workers over a five-year period.

The forestry projects will, apart from the generation of
additional employment opportunities, contribute to the
conservation of forest resources and the environment,
thereby reducing the uncontrofled destruction of forests
and mitigating associated problems of soi! erosion.AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
PROBLEMS AND STRATEGIES

An Outline of the Main Findings of the Second Asian Agricultural Survey

Asa follow-up to the Asian Agriculivral Survey that it undertook in 1967, the Bank conducied the Second
Asian Agricultural Survey (AAS il) in 1976, the results of which were disseminated in 1977. The second Survey
was directed towards an evaluation of significant aspects of recent agricultural and rural Gevelopment
experience in Asia, particularly during the period since the first Survey, and to an analysis of the tasks ahead for
the next decade, in order to evolve the elements of strategy to deal with the emerging situation and problems.

The Decade in Retrospect. Priority in AAS Ilis placed on tracing the origins of problems rélating to the
level of effective demand for foadgrains, employment, the disiribution of ownership of productive asseis and
income, and linkages between the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors of the economy. AAS II notes ther,
despite the introduction of superior agricultural technologies, the rural population has not shared much in the
benefits, Rural poverty is widespread and what evidence is available suggesis that it has worsened in the past
decade.

There continues to be @ substantial gap between yields obtained at the experimental station and these
obtained by farmers. Major problems appear to be a lack of properly trained operators; the inability to organize
farmers and rural workers effectively so that the potential for higher levels of production, efficiency and
employment can be realized; inadequate extension and input delivery systems, and structures of asset
ownership in the village, which allow the better-off farmers to benefit disproportionately from new methods of
production,

lt has been found that intersectorai linkages are constrained Dy many factors. The demand for
agricultura: production inputs from the non-agricultural sector and rural demands for non-agriculiural consumer products continue to be weak.

The impression gained from the experiences of the past decade is that many government programs
were worked out as responses to short-term situations, and that insufficient consideration was given to
assessing the implications for the long-run orientation of policy.

Tasks Ahead. Attentionis focused in AAS li on the nature and relative magnitudes of pressures in three
critica’ areas of the economic system:

(i) The capacity of domestic agriculture to provide food relative to both consumption needs and
demands. :
(i) The ability of agriculture tc absorb labor relative to the workforce available for ruralemployment.
(4) The prospects for the agricuitural sector of earning and saving foreign exchange relative to
import requiremenis.

Elements of Strategy. The broad objectives of agricultural and rural development during the next
decade have been identified as:

{i} Acceleration of growth in agricultural output.

(iil) Maximum benefits of this growth to go to the srnall farmers.

(iii) Additiona! opportunities for wage-paid employment or supplementary occupations in both farm
and non-farm activity in rural areas.

(iv) Strengthening of links between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. :

(v) Organization of production and trade in agricultural commodities in such a manner that the
DMCs’ economies can share in global increases in productivity and income, and be more
adequately safeguarded from vulnerability to fluctuations in international trade.

AAS II examines the technological requirements for agricultural growth with special emphasis on the
interaction between technological change and rural institutions. It also points out the shortcomings of present

agricultural credit systems and suggests new approaches for dealing with the problem of designing viable 
credit programs for small farmers. AAS {I also indicates other institutional changes, the reforms needed and the
directions for agricultural price policies.

Analyzing the extent and characteristics of agricultural unemployment and underemployment, AAS 1
stresses the need for increasing off-farm employment and outlines key elements ina sural employment strategy.

More Effective Foreign Aid. AAS tl examines the role of foreign aid in the context of agricultural and
tural development and discusses the self-help measures required to make such aid mere effective. In this
context, among other things, ihe need for more program (as opposed to project) assistance, more local cost
financing, further uniying of aid, and the simpiitication of procedures have been noted as requiring closer
attention.

The Report on the Second Asien Agricultural Survey was published in 1978 by Praeger Speciat Studies, New York, under the ttle
“Rural Asia: Chaltenge and Opportunity”.

Industry (including Development Banks)

The Industry (including Development Banks) sector
received seven loans (four for industrial projects and three
for DFls) totalling $137.6 million in 1977, compared to nine
loans for $204.5 million in 1976.

Bank lending to the industry sector has aimed at helping its DMCs to develop their basic industries and to
strengthen institutions which are involved in the promotion
of small and medium-scale industries, Four industrial
projects received loans amounting to $42.6 million. These
included a supplementary loan to finance the cost overrun in the Bank-financed Baturaja Cement Project in
indonesia. With the objective of promoting better quality
control in small and medium-scale industries in the
Republic of Korea, the Bank approved a loan for the
Industrial Products Inspection Centers Project — the first
loan of its kind — aimed at upgrading facilities in Korea for
the testing and inspection of indusicial products. Two
Pacific Island countries received assistance for industrial
projects — the Small Industries Center Project in Tonga
wilt assist the establishment of infrastructure facilities for
the promotion of small-scale industries in that country, and

the Coconut Oil Mill Project in Western Samoa will assist
that country fo process its main agricultural output for
export.

In 1977 three credit lines amounting to $95 million were
approved for three DFls to meet the foreign exchange
needs of industries in the countries concerned; the loan to
the National Development Finance Corporation in Pakistan
{$30 million) will finance socio-economic development
projects in the public sector in that country, while that fo the
Bank Pembangunan Indonesia ($30 million) — the first by
the Bank to a DFI in that country — will finance similar
projects in the public and private sectors in Indonesia, The
credit line to the Development Bank of the Philippines (335
million), the second to this institution, is intended for mining
and manufacturing projects in the private sector.

Through its loans to DFis, the Bank has been able to
channel and disperse medium and long-term development funds to a large number of small and medium-sized
projects, whose individual financing requirements are not
large enough to warrant the direct supervision of the Bank.
In addition, assistance to DFls tends to promote strong
and effective domestic investment institutions which couldPRINTING plant in Fiji financed with a Bank subfoan through
the Fiji Development Bank.

play an important part in mobilizing and channelling
domestic and foreign resources for investment projects.
Also, DFis have increasingly engaged in promotional
activities by identifying and formulating projects and by
assisting entrepreneurs of small and medium-sized
projects. Finally, DFls function as important centers for the
dissemination of modern business management practices
and promote adoption of appropriate technologies.

Power

In its lending to the Power sector, the Bank gives priority
to meeting the growing energy requirements of its DMCs,
with an emphasis on the development of indigenous
energy resources, as well as on the balanced growth of
transmission and distribution facilities to ensure a better
quality of supply and reduced energy losses.

Nine lodns totalling $217.6 million were approved in this
secior in 1977, compared to three loans for $128.7 million
in 1976. Five of the projects were for power generation and
related facilities, three for power transmission and distribution facilities, and one (a technical assistance loan) for
a feasibility study, detailed design and preparation
of tender documents for a large thermal generating unit.
All the generation projects were for hydropower development emphasizing the utilization of indigenous energy
resources. They included a project for setting up mini-hydropower facilities in four provincial centers in Papua New
Guinea — the first project of this nature to be assisted by
the Bank — which is well suited to meet the peculiar demand conditions in Papua New Guinea. Similar attention
was paid to particular local features in two of the distribution projects: the Power Distribution Project in Indonesia

includes a provision for coordinating the integration of vatious local and provincial projects financed by different aid
agencies into a single compatible system; while the Chittagong Power Distribution Project in Bangladesh contains a
large technical assistance component to prepare a project
for rehabilitating the power systems in that country's east
and west zones.

Power projects contribute towards improving the standard of living of the people in the areas served, and also
open up new industrial investment and employment
opportunities. The mini-hydropower project in Papua New
Guinea mentioned above will enable development fo take
place in rural areas themselves and thus minimize the
tendency for migration to urban areas with consequent
socio-economic problems. The hydropower projects in
Pakistan and Afghanistan will meet a significant power
demand for irrigation purposes, and thus help improve
agricuiturai incomes and accelerate more broadly based
regional growth in those countries.

Water Supply and Urban Development
Four loans totalling $105.3 million were approved in
1977 for the Water Supply and Urban Development sector,

FLOOD controf works on the Wampu River near Medan,
provincial capital of North Sumatra, a project designed to
benefit oif palm and rubber estates, padi fields, and about
110,000 people living in an agricultural area of about 28,000
hectares.22

compared to five loans for $75.3 million in 1976. These
included three water supply projecis, one each in the
Repubtic of Korea, Malaysia and Pakistan, and one urban
development project in Hong Kong.

The water supply project in the Republic of Korea
involves the construction of independent water supply
systems in two regional areas and will supply potable
water to various cities, towns, rural centers and industrial
complexes. The Sabah Water Supply Project in Malaysia
invoives the expansion and improvement of water supply
systems in Kota Kinabalu and Tawau and nearby rural
areas. The project in Pakistan will rehabilitate and expand
existing water supply ang sewerage systems, and help to
upgrade the present inadequate drainage system for the
city of Faisalabad. These three projects together wilt
provide an additional 700,000 CMD (cubic meters per day)
of water, increasing the aggregate system capacities
almost threefold to 1.1 million CMD. The additional number
of people who will have access to safe potable water under
these projects is estimated at nearly 1.9 million, including
500,000 in rural areas, This will be made possible by
extensive pipelaying, amounting to about 500 km., to
service additional areas. In one case, in addition to house
connecticns, an estimated 800 standpipes will be set upto
serve approximately 120,000 people from the low-income
group. The project in Pakistan will make sewerage facilities available for the first time to approximately 120,000
peopie.

The urban development project in Hong Kong will assist
in overcoming the present state of overcrowding and
substandard tiving conditions for low-income families, and
will alleviate the sociai problems associated with severe
density of population in certain areas of Hong Kong.

Transport and Communications

The Bank's lending in the Transport and Communications sector continued to emphasize the improvement of
rural road networks and feeder roads, as also rehabilitation
and development of port facilities. The main objective was
to meet growing transport needs at low cost, particularly in
the rural and undeveloped areas of the countries concerried.

Seven loans totalling $146 million were approved in
1977, four for road projects and three for part development
projects, compared to eight loans totalling $166.6 million in
1976. The loans for the road projects, one each in Bangladesh, the Republic of Korea, Papua New Guinea and the
Philippines, amounted to $116.5 miltion, involving between
them the construction and improvement of approximately
4,200 km. of roads. The projects in the Republic of Korea
and the Philippines are designed to improve road networks
in tural areas and will serve an estimated population of
three million people, providing improved access to marketing facilities and stimulating economic activities in
the areas influenced by them. These projects also include
built-in provisions for feasibility studies of further packages
of road networks for improvements envisaged in the
coming years. The remaining two projects (in Bangladesh
and Papua New Guinea}, each involving a loan of $15
million, are primarily aimed at providing improved access
between deep-water ports and their hinterlands

Apart from increasing incomes through better communications and improved access to markets for foodstuffs
and goods produced in such areas, road projects are expected to generate various socio-economic benefits for
rural people. Since, in the implementation of projects in
fabor-surpius countries, emphasis is taid on the use of
more jabor-intensive methods of construction, new job
opportunities are also créated for unskilfed labor; for instance, about 4,000 such workers are expected to find jobs
during the construction of the Khuina-Mongla Road Project in Bangladesh. Rural roads also promote baianced
development by narrowing the gap between the rural and
urban sections of society, as in the case of the projects in
the Republic of Korea and the Philippines mentioned
above.

The foans for three ports projects amounted to $28.5 milfion. The Bank's main objective in this field has been to
prepare ports in DMCs to cater for the development needs
of the countries concerned and to handle an increasing
volume of traffic as well as changing traffic demands, e.g.,
from conventional to specialized (container) vessels. Apart
from the economic benefits which usually resuft from port
improvements, namely, the reduction in overalt costs in
transferring cargo between ship and shore, port projects also
assist in facilitating access to overseas markets for domestic products from the hinterland, Among the projects
approved during the year was the Second Penang Port
Expansion Project in Malaysia, which will enable that port
to cope with growing seaborne container traffic (including
roll on-roil off and lift on-lift off operations), and the Honiara
Port Development Project in Solomon Islands. The need
for port facilities for domestic shipping also received
attention, with additional berths for inter-island ships being
provided under the Fourth Port Project in indonesiaHIGHLIGHTS OF THE BANK'S LENDING
OPERATIONS TO THE END OF 1977

Since its first oan in 1968, the Bank's lending operations have been directed towards a wide spectrum of
economic and social improvements in its OMCs. Some illustrations are as follows:

41 irrigation and area development projects covering about 849,000 ha., which support about
762,000 farmers. Total population expected to benefit — about 4.3 million.

17 fisheries development projects which will create additional employment opportunities for
about 30,000 fishermen, raise fish catch by about 333,000 m.t. per year and benefit about 17.6
million consumers.

6 fertilizer projects which will help increase the region's fertilizer supplies by 1.6 million tons of
nitrogen nutrients and 76,000 tons of phosphate nutrients per annum.

2,045 subloans to smali and medium-scale enterprises through credit lines to DFis.

64 projects for creation of 2.42 million kW of generation capacity and for about 23,000 km. of
transmission-distribution circuits; of the generation capacity to be developed, over threequarters will be in the form of low-cost hydropower,

26 water supply and sewerage projects, which will help increase water supply capacity by 5.6
tnillion cubic meters per day to 13.5 million cubic meters per day, benefitting a population of
nearly 36 million in metropolitan areas, smaller towns and provincial districts.

Construction or upgrading and improvement of 3,633 km. of roads in 29 projects, serving an
estimated population of 35.9 million

Construction, rehabilitation, modernization and expansion of ports in ten countries to increase
cargo-handling capacity by about 20 million tons per year.

Establishment of new technical and vocational education facilities in 10 separate institutes with
an annual output of 3,750 skilled workers, 3,550 technicians and 600 engineers.

Upgrading of technical and vocational education facilities in 26 separate institutes which have an
annual output of approximately 500 skilled workers, 1,850 technicians and 10,000 engineers.

By the end of the year, 81 of the 309 approved projects had been completed, and the benefits of many
other well-advanced projects were already beginning to be felt.

Education

In the Education sector, the Bank provided two loans,
totalling $20.2 million during the year, both the result of
earlier technical assistance provided by the Bank. The
Vocational Education Project in Nepal will establish a
campus of the Institute of Engineering in the eastern region
of the country, where basic technicat skills will be taught,
with specific reference to immediate focal needs and
employment opportunities, The loan includes provision for
new buildings, equipment, fellowships, expert services
and student and staff housing. The Engineering Education
Project in the Philippines is aimed at the graduate level
Through an accreditation program, staff upgrading,

Loan Administration

At the end of the year the Bank was administering 213
active loans, amounting to $2,900 million. Cumulative loan
disbursements since 1968 then exceeded $1,500 million
and disbursements had been completed in a total of 81
loans. As more projects entered the critical phases of
physical construction and initial testing and operation,

region,

ment supervision and the monitoring of progress in implementation — continued to expand. New staff were
assigned and further efforts were made to improve and
streamline relevant procedures through the preparation of
operational manuals and staff training. A comprehensive
review of disbursements and other loan administration
matters was undertaken in order to see where further
improvements couid be made in existing practices and
procedures. At year-end, the Guidelines on Uses of Consultanis were under review.

Improvemenis introduced during the year in procedures
for the review of procurement transactions have resulted in
faster and more systematic action on the part of the Bank.
A computerized monitoring system has been developed
and is now being employed to analyze disbursement
trends and to forecasi future loan withdrawals, both on a
Project and sub-sectoral! basis. Efforts were also made to
widen the field of eligible consultants registered with the
Bank, particularly in some of the more specialized areas of
expertise.

Procurement of domestic goods and construction
services under Bank ioans was provided for in appropriate
cases during the year, in accordance with the domestic
procurement arrangements introduced in 1976, butitis still
too earty to assess the effect of this measure. A review of
the operation of the Bank’s domestic procurement policy is

A total of 170 missions covering 185 projects were
despatched to 20 DMCs in 1977. These included a number
of special couniry disbursement missions mounted for the

:
Post-Evaluation

A Program for Action for evaluating completed projects
was approved by the Bankin 1974. By the end of the year a
total of 17 post-evaluation studies had been completed; 13
of these were carried out internally by staff and the
remaining four were conducted by fully independent
external evaluating agencies.

The primary purpose of post-evaluation is to ascertain
the extent to which Bank-assisted projects have achieved
their intended objectives, and to apply the experience
gained thereby to improving the Bank's operational activities.

During 1977 the Bank completed three post-evaluation
studies prepared by staff with the assistance of short-term
outside consultants, covering an agricultural credit project,
a petro-chemical (caprolactam) project, and a fisheries
project. Two other studies, one on a port project and the
other on a power project, were substantially completed. fn
addition, a group of outside experts completed a study of a

DFI project, while negotiations with another group for
carrying out a study of another fisheries project were nearing compietion.

Evaluation results show that the path towards successful project implementation has not always been smooth
and that some common probiems have been encountered
during various stages of implementation in the project
cycle. For example, virtually alt projects experienced implementation delays and, in some cases, there was the
problem of cost overruns. Another common problem was
shortfall in physical performance, particularly in agricultural projects. .

Based on the findings of post-evaluation studies, conditions for success and causes for failure of the projects
reviewed have been identified. Such findings have cot
iributed to a better understanding of project behavior which
provides a basis for improving project design and implementation of subsequent projects. The nature of feedback
of evaluation lessons varies. Some findings are project
specific, while others show promise of sectoral applica:
bility. As thes number of completed projects increases,
post-evaluation results, systematicaly compiled and
analyzed, will become an important tool of management
for the Bank as well as for the executing agencies con”
cerned. In the meanwhile, a review has been initiated of
the post-evaluation policies and procedures of the Bank
with a view inter alia to streamlining them and increasing
their impact on the Bank's operational functions. The re
cently constituted Audit Committee" is fully involved in this
matter.

Technical Assistance and Regional Activities

Technical Assistance Activities

An important element of the Bank's developmental rote
is the provision of technical assistance to DMCs,
especially to improve their capability to make effective use
of external project financing, whether from the Bank or
from other sources.

The main vehicie for Bank financing of this nature is the
Technical Assistance Special Fund, established in 1968,
to which both developed and developing member countries of the Bank had contributed a total of $31.1 million by
the end of 1977. Technical assistance operations are also
financed trom net income from the Bank's ordinary capital
resources from time to time. !n addition, the Bank administers technical assistance projects financed by other
sources, such as UNDP and the EEC, while it cooperates
with FAO on a cost-sharing basis in providing project pre
paratory technical assistance in the field of agricuiture.

Among the more specific objectives of technical assistance activities are efforts to improve the technical, managerial and organizational capabilities of DMCs; to identify,
formulate and implement development projects more effectively; to establish and strengthen DMCs’ various development institutions; and to formulate national or sectoral development strategies and pians.

The Bank's technical assistance operations expanded
substantially in 1977, both in the amount of assistance provided and the number of projects assisted. Forty-two technical assistance projects amounting to $7.2 million’ were
approved during the year, compared to 24 amounting to
$4.6 million in 1976. Of these, 14 projects were wholly or
partly financed from other sources in 1977, with the Bank
acting as Executing Agency.

Project preparatory technical assistance amounted to
$6 million for 34 projects, while advisory and operational
technical assistance amounted to $1.2 million for eight
projects. in addition, technical assistance components
were included in many of the Bank's loans — amounting to
$6.8 million in all, $2.6 million for project preparatory purposes and $4.2 million for project implementation.

Seventeen DMCs received technical assistance in 1977
— Cook Islands for the first time. The fully eligible Special
Funds countries received $4.5 million for 24 projects, compared to $3.3 million for 15 projects in 1976.

Technical assistance continued to be a large and highly
effective component of the Bank's activities in the Pacific
region, where there are generally substantial gaps In technical know-how and expertise. A total of seven technical
assistance grants, amounting to $605,000, were provided
to Pacific DMCs in 1977 — four advisory and three for project preparation.

On a sectoral basis, 55 per cent of the total amount of
technical assistance approved in 1877 was provided for
agriculture {irrigation, livestock, fisheries, forestry, paim oil
and integrated rural development) and agro-industry
{cotton storage and sugar). Of the remainder, about 13 per
cent was provided for industry, 10 pey cent for power development, 10 per cent for ports and roads, $ per cent for
education and 3 per cent for water supply and urban development.

Seventeen loan projects approved in 1977 resulted from
earlier technical assistance provided by the Bank. The
total amount of such loans was $348 million. The total cost
of the earlier technical assistance was $7.5 million, comprising $2 million provided on a grant basis and $5.5 million
provided on a {oan basis. By the end of 1977, cumulatively,
91 loans totalling $1,281 mitlion had resulted from technical assistance provided by the Bank costing $13.7 million
in all.

Twenty-two technical assistance projects were completed in 1877, 18 for project preparation and four for advisory and operational purposes, bringing the total number
of technical assistance projects completed thus far to 144.

The total amount of technical assistance approvais to
the end of 1977 stood at $35.4 million’

Regional Activities

Seven regional activities, mainly in the fields of agriculture and development banking, were financed by the
Bank in 1977 at a total cost of $908,820 (see opposite
page for details).

An amount of $91,000 was approved for Follow-Up
Activities on the Findings of the Second Asian
Agricultural Survey (AAS I!). The Report on the Survey,
which was undertaken in 1976, was provisionally printed
in Aprit for circulation primarily to member governments
and for the Bank’s own internal requiremenis. A summary of the major findings of AAS II may be found on page
19, The follow-up activities undertaken in 1977 were the
printing of the edited Report for wide commercial distribution — the Report will appear early in 1978 — anda
Press Seminar in Tokyo in October in conjunction with the
Nomura Research institute. Two sub-regional seminars,
to analyze and discuss implications of the Survey with
senior policy-makers from DMCs, and the production of a
television program and radio broadcasts for dissemination
in interested member countsies, were scheduled for early
1978.

A grant of $500,000 was made to the International Rice
Research Institute (IRRi) at Los Bafos io increase the size
of its rice variety development program and to expand its
genetic evaluation and utilization program. The grant will
be used to procure equipment for a Rice Genetic Resources Laboratory, the construction cost of which ($1.6
million) is being financed by Japan under the auspices
of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural
Research. The Laboratory will expedite the development
of superior rice lines and varieties for use throughout
the world, especially in Asia, and will be the focal point for
an international complex which will collect, preserve, disseminate and test rice germ plasm, IRR! received an earlier grant of $300,000 from the Bank in 1975 for the expansion of its research and training facilities, and the
high-yielding rice varieties and breeding lines developed
by IRR} over the fast decade have been of great benefit to
Bank-financed irrigation projects.

A Regional Seminar on the Application of Appropriate Technology in Road Construction and Maintenance was sponsored by the Bank in collaboration with
the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the Swedish International Development Authority. The Bank contributed an amount of $33,500 towards the cost of the Seminar, which was held in Manila from 16 to 25 May. Its main
aim was to show how resource allocation in the roads sector, which often represents a substantial proportion of government investment in developing countries, can be made
more effective by the inclusion of labor-intensive methods.

The Seminar was atténded by senior government officials from 17 DMCs, specialists in particular aspects of
appropriate technology in road construction and maintenance, representatives of various international organizations and institutions, and ILO staff members concerned with appropriate construction technology. Various
aspects of labor-based and intermediate technologies in
road construction and maintenance were examined and
the current practices prevailing in the countries of Asia and
the Pacific reviewed. Guidelines for future action to
promote the use of appropriate technology in the region
were formulated.REGIONAL ACTIVITIES iN 1977

The Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO)
sponsored a six-day Working Group Meeting on PreInvestment Planning for Water Supply and Sewerage
Development at WHO's Regional Headquarters in Manila
in- October. The Meeting was attended by senior government officials involved in development planning for
this sector,in 12 DMCs. It was conducted against the
background of the emerging “basic needs" strategy, which
emphasizes the commitments of governments to the provision of minimum human necessities of food, water, sanitation and housing as a major development abjective.
Ways and means of reducing investment backlogs and of
accelerating investment in rural water supply and sanitation, and urban water supply and waste disposal, were examined and recommendations were made on ways of
overcoming constraints on development in this sector, with
special emphasis on institution-buildirig and information
transfer. The need for longer-term national and regional
planning, and coordination with other sectors in the context
of area development, was highlighted. The Bank contributed an amount of $22,600 to the cost of the Meeting.

A Training Program on Development Banking for
the South Pacific Region was held in Papua New Guinea
{Port Moresby and Goroka) and Fiji (Suva) from 12 September to 29 October, in collaboration with the Papua New
Guinea Development Bank and the Fiji Development
Bank. An amount of $114,500 was provided for this purpose by the Bank. Twenty-two professional staff from six
Pacific DFis and seven concerned government departments attended the Program, which was geared to an
analysis of small agricultural and industrial projects. Particular.emphasis was placed on the financial aspects of
project appraisal and on the role of promotional activities in
the development of the Pacific region. The Bank has so far
organized five regional programs on development
banking, which have helped to train 110 staff members

from 35 DFIs and seven concerned government departments in 20 OMCs.

The Bank held a Regional Course on Agricultural
Development Banking (the second undertaken by the
Bank) in Jakarta from 7 November to 16 December, in collaboration with the Bank Rakyat Indonesia, the Foundation
for the Development of Banking in Indonesia and the
German Foundation for International Development. The
Course was attended by 25 participants trom 18 agricultural finance corporations, cooperatives, commercial
banks and other institutions dealing with the agricultural
sectors in 11 DMCs. The Course, designed for training officers of agricultural credit institutions, covered institutional
aspects of agricultural banking, particularly as these concern small farmers. Special consideration was given to a
study of various possible for ms of agricultural creditinstitutions, including their lending policies and procedures. The
Bank provided an amount of $116,320 for the Course.

A grant of $31,500 was approved for the Asian Productivity Organization's (APO} Eighth Project Feasibility Study Training Course, to be held in the Philippines
(Stage 1) and Japan (Stage [}) from January to March 1978.
The Bank had earlier provided assistance for the preceding
five APO Project Feasibility Study Training Courses. The
Seventh Course was held in the Philippines in January and
February 1977 and was attended by 29 participants from
12 countries, including 11 regional member countries of
the Bank.

Throughout 1977 the Bank continued to assist in the implementation of Phase I} of the Nam Ngum Hydropower
Project in the Lao Peopie's Democratic Republic inits role
as Administrator of the Second Nam Ngum Development
Fund and Coordinator of the execution of the Project. With
the Bank's assistance, sufficient funds have been mobilized from ten Contributor Governments for financing the
Project, now estimated to cost approximately $44 million.
Project works progressed considerably during the year,
and the commissionjng of the Project is expected to take
place substantially on schedule in June 1978.

By the end of, the year total approvals for regional
activities amounied to $7.3 million.

Lending and Operational Policies

Review of the Criteria for Lending from the Asian
Development Fund

A review of the criteria for lending from the Asian Development Fund (ADF}, the Bank’s concessional lending
window, was carried out in September. The main conclusions reached were as follows:

(i} The eligibility of a DMC for ADF loans should cantinue to be determined on country considerations, i.e.,
on the basis of a country’s economic situation. (ii) Per
capita GNP should be used as a basic indicator of a
DMC's economic situation for the purpose of grouping
DMCs into those eligible and those not eligible for ADF
loans, with $380 in terms of per capita GNP in 1975 as
the benchmark. tn determining eligibility, a DMC's
debt-repayment capacity should also be considered.
{iit} Certain DMCs in the Pacific, because of their peculiar economic circumstances, should continue to receive
special consideration in the application of the per capita

GNP and the debt-repayment capacity criteria in deter
mining their eligibility for ADF loans,

in allocating ADF resources among eligible DMCs, the
general principle to be observed is that DMCs which are
least developed, or most seriously affected by recent world
economic developments, will have first priority. A DMC
fully eligible for ADF loans may also receive ordinary loans
on a case-by-case basis if the size of the Bank’s operational program in the country is farger than can reasonably
be financed from the ADF, and if the country has the capacity to absorb the harder terms of ordinary loans. In applying the blending principie, priority in the allocation of ADF
resources should be given to projects with a high social
and economic value but a low financial rate of return, or low
foreign exchange earning capacity, or long gestation period.

The criteria for lending from the ADF wiil be further reviewed in 1978.

Guarantee Operations

The possibility of the Bank engaging in guarantee operations was considered during the year. This was done in
response to a recommendation by the Development Com
mittee! that the World Bank and the regional banks should
use their existing powers to consider requests for guarantees, or partial guarantees, of bond issues made by
interested developing countries. The genera! question of
guarantees by international financial institutions and the
Bank's own position in the light of the limitations placed on
such operations by its Charter was carefully examined. In
the event it was decided that the Bank should take no further initiative in regard to this matter at the present time.
However, the Bank would be prepared to consider, on its
merits, and in partial substitution for a direct loan, any proposal that might be received from a potential borrower for
the use of the guarantee mechanism in relation to specific
major projects where the total foreign exchange costs are
too large to be fully financed through Bank loan and cofinancing arrangements. In the meantime, the Bank would
continue to assist DMCs in obtaining co-financing on reasonabie terms, including co-financing with commercial
Danks.

Review of Loan Regulations

Revised Ordinary Operations Loan Regulations (formerly Loan Regulations No. 1} and revised Special Operations Loan Regulations were adopted in February.
The main objective of the revisions was to simplify and clarify the existing Regulations. Pursuant to Section 11 of the
Bank's By-Laws, the revised Loan Regulations were reviewed and noted by the Board of Governors at ihe Tenth
Annual Meeting.

Review of Technical Assistance Activities

in May the Bank's technical assistance policies were
reviewed and modified, with a view to making technical
assistance operations more responsive to the needs of
OMCs in future.

lt was decided that technical assistance would be provided by the Bank not only to prepare projects for its own financing, but also for financing by other aid agencies, and
that technical assistance aimed at improving technical,
managerial and administrative capabilities in borrowing
countries would be expanded. In addition, increasing attention would be given to sectoral and problem-oriented
studies, which may or may not be related to specific development projects. In all these endeavors, special attention would be paid to the needs of the less developed
OMCs in view of the particular problems which they faced

in preparing and implementing development projects. A
further objective set was to encourage, through technical
assistance operations, closer cooperation among DMCs.

In order to pave the way for the realization of these
objectives. operating procedures were liberalized in certain respects. The specific changes made were:

{i} The limit which the Bank may provide as a grant
in technical assistance for project preparation
(e.g. for a feasibility study) would be $150,000 in
tuture, instead of $100,000.

(i) Technical assistance programs, involving Ihe
preparation of a number of sub-projects, would
be eligible for technical assistance loans

(iii) Retroactive financing of technical assistance
would be provided under certain conditions,
mainly in respect of consultants services for feasibility studtes and detailed engineering.

(iv) The services of loca! consultants would be financed on the same basis as if a foreign firm had
been engaged, subject to conformity with the
Bank's normal selection procedures for consultants.

{v) Foreign exchange financing of certain local currency expenditures would be provided on a caseby-case basis, up to a maximum of 10 per cent of
the amount of the relevant technical assistance
grant.interagency Cooperation

The Bank continued to recognize the importance of
keeping in close contact with other institutions interested in
economic development in Asia. Special attention was paid
in 1977 to setting up institutional arrangements for
cooperation with the newer funding agencies — initially the
OPEC Special Fund and later IFAD — and for strengthening operational links with the EEC and with such
specialized agencies as FAO,ILO, WHO etc. Working relations with the World Bank and UNDP continued to be
close.

The annual consultations between the Presidents of the
African, the Asian and the Inter-American Development
Banks — the eighth in the series — were held in Washington, D.C. in September 1977. The World Bank was aiso represented, Topics discussed included the role of these
international institutions in the development of mineral and
energy resources, matters related to their financial policies
and the status of the replenishment of their respective resources. A separate session was held with representatives
of the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development,
the OPEC Special Fund, the European Investment Bank
and the European Development Fund.

World Bank Group

Cooperation between the Bank andthe World Bank continued through frequent visits by officers and exchanges of
information on operational activities and country ecsnomic
developments. The Bank was represented as an observer

at the IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings held in Washington, D.C. in September. Furthermore, the President
attended meetings of the Development Committee of the
IMF-IBRD in Washington, D.C. in May and September. The Bank was also represented at the aid coordination
meetings held in 1977 under the auspices of the World
Bank for Bangladesh, the Republic of Korea, Nepal,
Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

International Fund for Agricultural Development
{iFAD)

The year 1977 marked the formal establishment of
IFAD. After two further sessions of its Preparatory Commission in April and July, IFAD came into existence on
30 November. The inaugural sessions of the IFAD Governing Council and Executive Board were held in Rome
in mid-December. The Bank was represented as an
observer at the sessions of the Preparatory Commission
and the Governing Council and strengthened its close association wiih, and assistance to, IFAD in various ways.
The secondment of a staff member to the Preparatory
Commission for IFAD was extended to almost the entire
year. Close consultations were held with the Preparatory
Commission, particularly on operational and financial
matters. A draft cooperation agreement between IFAD
and the Bank was provisionally approved in June. This
took into account corresponding draft cooperation
agreements between IFAD and other multilateral financial
institutions, Potentiai projects suitable for early iFAD
financing were discussed with IFAD representetives. From

1978 onwards the Bank expects to be actively involved in
co-financing and administering projects financed by
IFAD, with a view to accelerating agricultural development
in the region.

European Economic Community (EEC)

The framework for cooperation between the EEC and
the Bank, which was established towards the end of 1976,
came into effect with a Financing Agreement concluded in
January. Under this agreement, the EEC offered a grant of
$1.98 million from its 1976 budget to finance a number of
technical assistance projects to be prepared and executed
by the Bank in several of its less developed DMCs. Of
those proposals considered, seven technical assistance
projects totalling $1.5 million were approved in 1977 for
EEC financing with the Bank acting as Executing Agency.
in addition to the above, the EEC provided $200,000 for
the inland fisheries portion of the Second Fisheries
Development Project in Bangladesh approved by the Bank
in 1976.

In September the Bank entered into discussions with the
EEC on its offer to co-finance selected rural development
loan projectsin less developed DMCs. As aresult, the EEC
agreed to co-finance projects with the Bank on a grant
basis to the extent of about $140 million from its 1977
budget. Part of this amount has already been allocaled to
two projects in Pakistan and Afghanistan (see Table on
page 16). In addition, the EEC has agreed to allocate
$448,000 from its 1977 budget for financing various technical assistance projects to be executed by the Bank in
1978.

OPEC Special Fund

During the Tenth Annual Meeting of the Bank in April, he
Director-General of the OPEC Special Fund had substantive discussions with delegations from several DMCs and
Sank staff on possible cooperation between the Bank and
the OPEC Special Fund. As a result of these discussions

finalized (see Table on page 16), Loan agreements were
entered into between the Fund and the DMCs concerned,
and letters have been exchanged between the Fund
ard the Bank in regard to the execution of these projects.

United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)

The Bank continued its cooperation with UNDP during
the year. There were frequent consultations and
exchanges of information between UNOP Headquarters
and field offices and the Bank. The Bank was represented at the Twenty-Third and Twenty-Fourth Sessions
of the Governing Council of UNDP and aiso at the meetings of the Committee on Technica! Cooperation among
Developing Countries. During the year the Bank agreed to
act as Executing Agency for UNDP-financed ($470,000)
technicai assistance for the Sikta Irrigation anc Rural Deveiopment Project in Nepal and for UNDP financing
($150,000) of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Project in Bangladesh, to which the Bank itself contributed
$350,000.

Food and Agriculture Organization (FAC)

The Bank's association with FAO in project activity was
more extensive in 1977 than in any year since the Interim
Arrangements for Cooperative Action were established in
1968. FAO provided teams of experts on a cost-sharing
basis for project preparatory technical assistance for five
separate projects, two of which led to loans from the Bank
within the year. An FAO specialist also participated in a
Bank project identification mission to Bangladesh early in
the year, while close contact has been maintained with
FAQ concerning its other activities in most DMCs.

Other International Organizations

Cooperation with WHO was continued through informal
meetings and regular exchanges of information. Bank
missions held discussions with WHO regional officers and
experts on matters of common interestin pursuing relevant
operational activities. In March the Bank approved, and
co-sponsored with WHO, a Working Group on Pre-Investment Planning for Water Supply and Sewerage Deveiopment (see page 29).

in December 1976 discussions were held with senior officials of the ILO about the possibilities of cooperation between the Bank and that institution in future. This resulted
in technical assistance being provided by the Bank for the
Regional Seminar on the Application of Appropriate Technology in Road Construction and Maintenance (see page
28).

There was continuing cooperation, including exchanges
of staff visits, between the Bank and other international
organizations, such as the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations
Children’s Fund, the United Nations Capital Development

AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Review of Financial Policies

EARLY IN 1977 a comprehensive review was made of the
Bank's financial policies, including the lending rate and
commitment charge, liquidity policy and borrowings, and
other factors affecting the Bank's financial position (see
page 57). The maintenance of the Bank's net income and
reserves at satisfactory levels was accepted as an impertant financial objective. The liquidity policy was
modified; this resulted in a slight reduction in projected
liquidity requirements. The Bank's financial policies are to
be reviewed annually at the beginning of each year.

Increase in Capital Stock

The Second Genera! Capital Increase authorized under
Board of Governors’ Resolution No. 104' became effective
on 30 September 1977, the date originally approved, when
subscriptions were received from 20 member countries
amounting to $3.257 million, As of 31 December 1977
subscriptions amounting to $3,272 million from a total of 24
member countries had been received.

Capital

As of 31 December 1977 the authorized capital stock of
the Bank was $8,711 million (722,057 shares), having
been increased by $5,004 million (414,800 shares) when
the second general capital increase mentioned above
became effective. The subscribed capital stock was
$6,961. million (577,025 shares), consisting of $5,457 million (451,873 shares) in callable capital and $1,510 million
(125,152 shares) in paid-in capital. The subscribed capital
was increased during the year by $3,273 million (271,277
shares) on account of: (i) a subscription by Western Samoa of $108,572 (nine shares) under the first general capital increase authorized by Resolution No. 462 and a subscription by the same member country to a special capital
increase of $120,635 (ten shares); and (ii) the subscriptions by 24 member countries of $3,272 million (271,258
shares) under the second general capital increase.

liquidity position, the level of borrowing was considerably
lower than in recent years. Two borrowings amounting to
$117 million were undertaken,

Deutsche Mark Public tssue

In April the Bank made @ public offering in the Federal
Republic of Germany of DM100 million with an interest
rate of 7 per cent per annum payable annually, a full maturity of eight years and an issue price at par.

Two-Year United States Dollar Bonds

Also in April, Two-Year Bonds totalling $70 million, with
an interest rate of 62 per cent per annum payable semiannuaily, were sold at par to central banks and monetary

- authorities of 30 member countries. For the most part, pur
chases of the bonds were made by rolling over holdings of
the maturing 1975 issue of Two-Year Bonds, the aggregate principal amountof which was also $70 million.

Lending Rate

The lending rate of the Bank was reviewed in February
1977, and also in April, July and October. Taking into
account the trends in capital markets, the lending rates of
other financial institutions and the financial situation of the
Bank, the lending rate, which had been fixed ai 8.70 per
cent per annum with effect from 1 January 1977. was revised to 8.30 per cent per annum with effect from 1 July
1977." Pursuant to the decision taken in July, the raie
remained unchanged thereafter.

Member Currencies

In terms of the decision taken on 31 August 1972. the
Bank adopted new exchange rates in respect of the currencies of 27 member countries for translaticn in its accounts and for purposes relating to the maintenance of
value of such currencies held by the Bank. Most amounts
receivable from or payable to member countries in respect
of such maintenance of vatue obligations falling due in
1977 had been settled by the end of the year.

Loan Disbursements and Repayments

reached $131.7 million, consisting of $121.1 million on
loans held by the Bank and $10.6 million on portions sold to
participants.

Participations

A decline in interest rate tevels in the United States in the
fatter part of 1976 led to some revival of investor interestin
participating in the Bank's loans. Sales of participations in
several ioans were negotiated with a number of financial
institutions in late 1876/eariy 1977, resulting in sales
during 1977 of $2.4 million. Aggregate sales of participations as at the end of the yearfamounted to $17.2
million.

Investments

At the end of the year the Bank's total investments —
held in 22 separate currencies — amounted to the equiv~
alent of $1,009 million, of which 33.6 per cent was held in
government securities and government-guaranteed obligations of member countries and 66.4 per cent in time deposits and certificates of deposit with banks in member
countries and the Bank for International Settlements,

Of the total investments in government securities and
government-guaranteed obligations of member countries,
53.9 per cent was invested in securities maturing within
one year and 46.1 per cent in securities maturing after one
year. Of the total investments in time deposits and certificates of deposit with banks in member countries and the
Bank for International Settlements; 50.2 per cent was
invested in deposits maturing within one year and 49.8 per
cent in deposits maturing after one year.

Income and Expenses’

Gross income of the Bank in 1977, before net gain from
changes in the value of currencies, was $168.6 million, an
increase of $40.3 million, or 31.4 per cent on that for the
preceding year.

Administrative Expenses, after deducting $7.1 million
attributable to Special Funds operations, were $14 million.
Services to Member Countries amounted to $1.2 million,
while Financial Expenses were $90.9 million. Gross
Expenses for the year thus amounted to $106.1 million,

Net income for the year before net gain from changes in
the vaiue of currencies was therefore $62.5 million. There
was anet gain of $19.9 million on account of changes inthe
value of currencies during the year which increased the net
income to $82.4 million, of which $10.1 million was appropriated as commission to Special Reserve. The Bank's Net
Income after Appropriation of Commissions to Special
Reserve was therefore $72.4 million, as shown in
Appendix 1-1I.

Accumulated Net Income and Reserves

As of 31 December 1877, Ordinary Reserve amounted
io $142.2 million, having been increased by the Net Income After Appropriation of Commissions to Special Reserve for 1976 totalling $40.6 million, which the Board of
Governors allocated to Ordinary Reserve at the Tenth
Annuat Meeting.

The Bank also has a Special Reserve representing commissions appropriated pursuant to Articles 16 and 17. The
amount was $18.7 mitlion as of 31 December 1976. This
was increased by $10.1 million during the year to $28.8
million as of 31 December 1977.

The combined total of the two Reserves maintained by
the Bank therefore amounted to $171 million at the end of
1977.

SPECIAL FUNDS

THE Asian Development Fund (ADF) was established in
June 1974 in order to provide a systematic mechanism for
mobilizing and administering resources for the Bank to
lend on concessional terms. Administration of the earlier
Speciai Funds — the Multi- Purpose Special Fund (MPSF)
and the Agricultural Special Fund (ASF) — had been compiicated by the fact that contributions of individual donors
had been made voluntarily at the initiative of the countries
concerned and were frequently tied to procurement in
those countries. Under the restructuring proposals, the
ASF was wound up in the first half of 1973 and its resources consolidated with those of the MPSF. Nearly all of
the resources of the MPSF have now been transferred to
the ADF.

The initial mobilization of ADF resources (ADF |) was
intended to finance the Bank's concessionaf tending program for the three-year period ending 31 December 1975.
Contributions to ADF | totalling $486.1 million have been
received from 14 countries. At the end of 1975 the Board of
Governors authorized’ a replenishment of the resources
of the ADF (ADF Hi}, intended to finance the Bank's concessional lending program over the period 1976-1978. The
amount initially authorized was $830 million, but this was
subsequently reduced to $809 million, By the end of 1977,
14 of the Bank’s developed member countries had participated in ADF II with total contributions of $581 million.
During 1977 negotiations commenced on a second ADF
replenishment (ADF Ili).

Progress of the First ADF Replenishment (ADF 11)
The scheme envisaged for ADF I! had contemplated the
release of contributions in three annual instalments in
1976, 1977 and 1978. The first instalments were released
in June 1976, when the Bank had received instruments of
contribution exceeding the trigger amount of $475 million.
By the end of 1976 eleven countries, namely, Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Federal Republic of
Germany, italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway and United
Kingdom, had contributed to the replenishment, In the first
quarter of 1977 Switzerland deposited its instrument of
contribution, thereby bringing contributions to $565 million,
of which the first instalments, totailing $188.3 million, had
been released to the Bank. The trigger figures specified in Resolution No. 92 for the release of the second
instalments assumed, however, that the United States
would have commiited to the Bank its coniribution of $180
million and paid its first instalment of $60 million. By the

1 Resolution No. 92 adapted on 3 December 1975.

world through the Intelsat sateffite system.

early months of 1977 it had become clear that the United
States would not be in a position to release its first instalment before the last quarter of 1977, at the earliest. Consequenily, in order to enable the Bank to continue its concessionai tending program for 1977, the Board of Governors agreea on 14 April 1977 to reduce the second instalment trigger figures from $650 million to $550 million in
terms of commitments, and from $200 million to $185 million in terms of payments.* As a result, the second instalments of the 12 contributions committed as of that date became effective. :

During the second quarter of 1977 the Bank received
instruments of contribution from New Zealand and
Sweden, thus bringing to 14 the number of countries which
had contributed to ADF tl. The total amount so committed
by these 14 donor countries was $581 million; of this
amount, $389 million, representing the first two instalments? was unconditionally available to the Bank. In
the final months of the year legislative action was
completed for the appropriation of a portion amounting to
$49.5 million of the United States’ first instalment, thus
clearing the way for the release of the third and final
instalments of the contributions of the other donor
countries.

Inflow of Resources

The resources of the ADF and the MPSF at the end of
41976 totalled $932 million at prevailing exchange rates.
Against these resources, loan commitments totalling $890
mitlion had been approved, leaving a balance of only $42
million available for further lending on concessional terms.

The second instalments of ADF fl contributions added a
total of $206 million (at the exchange rates as of 31 December 1977) to the resources becoming unconditionally
available to the Bank during 1977. The first instalments of
the new contributions committed during the year by New
Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland added a further $9 million to available resources.

In June 1977 the Bank received the remaining $25 million of the United States’ contribution to ADF |. The Board
of Governors had amended Resolution No. 68 in October
1976 to permit the Bank to accept the outstanding contribution of $50 million to ADF } by the United States in two
equal instalments.* The first such instalment was received

which had indicated their intention to participate in ADF |
and brought their total contributions to $486 million.

Individual contributions to the MPSF and ADF have
been made in the national currencies of the respective
contributors. Maintenance of value obligations, which
apply in the case of subscriptions to the Bank's capital
stock, do not apply to these contributions. Consequently,
the total value of the resources made availabie to the Bank

‘for these Funds fluctuates with changing exchange rates.

In some years, partly as a result of significant depreciations in the currencies of some major contributions
against the United States dollar — in which the Bank’sioan
commitments are denominated — the Bank has found the
resources available for meeting its lending targets to be
substantially jess than it had expected when those targets
were established. However, sharp appreciations in some
major currencies during 1977 resulted in an increase in resources of the equivalent of US$116 million. Totai resources of the ADF and MPSF at the end of 1977 stood at
$1,285 million, an increase of $353 million since the end of
1976.SPECIAL FUNDS LOANS APPROVED IN 1977

Utilization’

The total of ADF loan commitments in 1977 was $272
million, $36 milion above that of the previous year. As of 31
December 1977 the cumulative amount committed in
loans (after allowing for exchange rate adjustments, cancellations and repayments) from the combined resources
of the ADF and MPSF was $1,192 million, leaving a balance of uncommitted resources at that time of $93 million.
Loan disbursements in 1977 amounted to $83.8 million,
bringing total disbursements from Special Funds resources to $295 million. Loan repayments in 1977 totalled $3.2
million; cumulative repayments up to the end of 1977
amounted to $5.9 million.

+ See chagier on Overaticns ard Poticies for description of lending from Special Funds and also tab:es above and on page 58.

Criteria for Lending from the ADF

The criteria for ADF lending were reviewed in September. An account of the review and its conclusions may be
found on pages 29 and 33.

Income and Expenses '

At the end of 1976 the MPSF nad an accumulated net
income of $289,378. In furtherance of the general objective of consolidating in the ADF to the greatest extent possible the resources still being administered in the MPSF,
this amount was transferred in 1977 to the ADF, as reported to the Board of Governors at the Tenth Annual Meeting. In 1977 the MPSF had a gross income of $555,480.

- expenses of $186,946, a net gain from changes in the

value of currencies of $99,576, and a resultant net income
of $468,110. This has been credited to Accrued Resources
of the MPSF in accordance with the Special Funds Rules
and Regulations. :

In 1977 the ADF had a gross income of $22.6 million,
gross expenses of $6.9 million and a net gain from
changes in the value of currencies of $1.6 million. Net
income for 1977 was therefore $17.3 million, bringing
accumulated net income to the end of 1977 to $28.6 million (see table on page $5).

Second Replenishment of the Asian Development
Fund {ADF If}

A meeting of ADF donor countries was held in Manila in
April 1977 at the time of the Tenth Annual Meeting to consider the resource position of the ADF, and the steps
needed to be taken towards a second replenishment. The
Bank's proposals for ADF Ill, designed to cover the program of lending on concessional terms envisaged over the
four-year petiod 1979-1982, were considered at a meeting
of donor countries in Kyoto in October. Although not alt
donor countries were then in 4 position to express definitive views on the amount of the proposed replenishment,
the need for a substantial replenishment was generally
accepted. It was decided that a further meeting would be
held in Geneva in February 1978 to discuss the Bank's
proposals, as well as the matter of an appropriate framework for the implementation of those proposals.

Transfer of Resources of the Multi-Purpose Special
Fund

A further step was taken in April 1977 towards completing the transfer to the ADF of the resources previously
administered in the MPSF, when an agreement for the
transfer of Australia's initial MPSF contribution (which had
been fully disbursed by the end of 1976) was concluded. At
the end of 1977 the only amounts remaining in the MPSF
were the uncommitted balance of $7.4 million of Canada’s
initial contribution and an amount of $773,346 on account
of accrued income and other credit. (Agreement for the
transter of Canada’s tied contribution had been reachedin
March 1976 whereby a portion was then untied and transferred immediately, with the balance to be transferred as
committed).

Procurement and Drawdown Arrangements
In February new arrangements were approved govern
+ Exglud:ng Techrical Assistance Sreczal Furd

5354

ing the determination of procurement eligibility under loans
financed from ADF resources, and the drawdown of such
resources to finance loan disbursements. Under these
atrangements, procurement under ADF toans is to be
limited to suppliers from alt developed member countries
with contributions currently under administration in the
ADF, as well as from DMCs. The drawdown arrangements
are designed to give effect to the requirement of the ADF
Regulations that contributions to the ADF be drawn uponin
such a manner that, over reasonable periods of time, the
Proportion of ail contributions drawn down would be
uniform. Pursuant to these arrangements, a total of $116
million was drawn down in 1977 from reciprocally untied
ADF contributions. Until the Bank has accumulated in the
ADF a substantial amount of resources other than contributed resources, disbursements under ADF loans are to
be financed as far as practicable by drawing upon contributions. Net income, repayments of ADF loans, and
set-aside resources are to be retained primarily as a
source of investment income. Wherever possible, the
Bank is to give priority to the utilization of tied contributions,
which by their nature cannot be treated under the uniform
drawdown arrangements. A total of $2.9 million was
drawn down from tied contributions in 1977.

Technical Assistance Special Fund
During 1977 initial contributions to the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) were made by two member

countries, while further contributions were made by slx
other countries, as follows:

Organization

In June the role of the Internal Audjtor’s Office was redefined and steps were taken to strengthen and improve
the audit function in the Bank by effecting an increase in
the staff of that Office. An Audit Committee. of the Board of
aa was also established during the year (see page

In the second half of the year, a consulting firm conducted a comprehensive study of the electronic data processing requirements of the Bank, with a view to developing a
pian to guide the Bank in assessing the possibile utilization
of computers to meet its present and future management
information and data processing needs. The final report of
the consultants is expected to be submitted early in 1978.

1 For further details, see Summary of Proceedings of the Tenth Annual Meeting.

2 Reelected (Directors) or reappointed (Alternates).

3 Appointment effective 3 January 1978.

A decision to proceed with computerization would have
important organizational and staffing imptications for the
Bank in due course.

General salary increases of 5.5 per cent for professional
staff and 6 per cent for supporting staff were approved by
the Board of Directors with effect from 1 August. The rental
subsidy scheme was modified and extended temporarily
for a further year until 30 September 1978.

Office Accommodation

Pursuant to the Supplementary Agreement to the Headquarters Agreement between the Philippine Government
and the Bank, the Government purchased a piot of land in
close proximity to the Headquarters, on which the Bank
proposes to construct a building to provide additional office
accommodation, for which there is a pressing and growing
need. Meanwhite, the host Government has kindly offered
the Bank the temporary rent-free use of space in the
Central Bank building complex. The transfer of certain staft
units to these temporary offices will take place early in
1978.

Staff

By 31 December 1977, the Bank's staff had reached a
total of 803 from 32 member countries. Of ‘these, 304
belonged to the professional staff category and 499 to the
supporting staff category. The overall increase during the
year was 44, comprising 16 professional staff and 28 supporting staff.

The Secretary of the Bank,’ Mr. D. C. Gunesekera,
retired on 31 August and was succeeded by Mr. S. Sardadi
on 30 November.

Budget for 1978

Administrative Expenses for 1977 totalled $22,064,387,
representing 97.5 per cent of the original Budget figure of
$22,628.000.

The Budget for 1978 is summarized in Appendix 2.

Internal Administrative Expenses for 1978 are estimated
at $25,957,000,’ representing an increase of 17.6 per cent
on actual expenditure in 1977. This increase is attributable
largely to: (i) the growth in loan, technical assistance and
other activities, requiring additional staff, more business
travel and greater use of consultants’ services; (ji) the
full-year effect of the salary increases arid improvements
in staff benefits approved in 1977; and (iii) anticipated
general price increases in 1978.

Disbursements on Servicesto Member Countriesin 1978
are estimated at $4,756,100, which is 57.6 per cent above
actual disbursements in 1977. This is mainly due to the expected impact on 1978 disbursements of the larger
number of projects approved in 1977.

Board of Directors,

(1) Unit of Account
The Ordinary Capital Resources financial statements are
expressed in current United States Dollars.

Assets and liabilities in currencies other than United
States Dollars were translated at the applicable rates
of exchange which prevailed at the end of the year,
except that, starting in 1977, unamortized issuance costs
of borrowings in such currencies were translated at
applicable historical rates.

The capital stock, which is defined in Article 4, paragraph
7 of the Articles of Agreement in terms of the United
States Dollar of the weight and fineness in effect on 31
January 1966, was translated into current United States
Dollars on the basis of 1.20635 current dotlars per 1966

Except for the 1977 amortization of issuance costs of
borrowings, income and expense amounts in currencies

was translated at applicable historical rates. This change
did not have a material effect on the 7977 financial

The authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 722,057
shares of $10,000 par value each in terms of the United States
Dollar of the weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966.
This is equivalent to $8,710,534,620 in terms of current United
States Dollars.

The authorized capitel stock consists of “‘callable’’ capital
stock and “paid-in capital stock. The “‘callable’’ capital stock
is subject to call only as and when required by the Bank to meet
obligations incurred on borrowings or on guarantees. The
“paid-in capital stock is paid or payable partly in gold or
convertible currencies and partly in the currency of the member.
In lieu of the portion paid or payable in the currency of the
member, provided such currency is not required by the Bank
for the conduct of its operations, the Bank shall accept nonnegotiable, non-interest-bearing demand obligations in accordance with Article 6, paragraph 3.

As of 31 December 1977, the subscribed capital stock wes
$6,960,941,087 {$3.688,390,998 -— 1976). All matured
instalments amounting to $1,118,351,794 ($1,069,881,657 —
1976) were received except $253,334 due from Cambodia on

Some members have made payments in respect of their capital
subscription instalments in advance of the due date. Such
payments are shown in the balance sheet (under the caption
“CAPITAL AND RESERVES") as "Advance payments on
subscriptions’’ pending the determination of the fuil value
cf such payments based on the rate of exchange to be used
by the Bank as of the date on which such payments are actually
due.

On 29 October 1976, the Board of Governors approved 6
proposal for a second general incresse of 135 per cent in the
authorized capital stock (from 307,257 shares valued at

APPENDIX 1-VIil

CONTINUED

I

$3,706,594 820 to 722,057 shares valued at $8,710,534.620).
This increase consists of 10 per cent “paid-in shares and 90
per cent “callable” shares. The “paid-in shares are required
to be paid for in four equal annual instalments commencing
in 1878, 40 per cent of each instatment being in convertible
currency and 60 per cent in the national currency of the
subscribing member. The increase became efiective on 30
September 1977 when subscriptions from members for shares
in excess of 240,000 shares were received by the Bank.

In April 1976, the Board of Governors of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) approved proposed amendments to its
Articles of Agreement which will become effective upon the
acceptance by 60 per cent of its members representing 80
per cent of its total voting power. As of 24 February 1978,
approximately 60 per cent of the members of the IMF
representing approximately 71 per cent of its total voting
power had accepted the amendments. Under these amendments, gold wii be abolished as a common denominator of tne
monetary system, currencies will no longer nave par values, and
all computations relating to currencies of IMF members for
the purpose of applying the provisions of the Articies of the IMF
will be made on the basis of the Special Drawing Right {SDR}.
Asa result, upon the effectiveness of the amendments to the MF
Articles, it will no longer be possible to determine, in current
monetary terms, the value of the unit in which the Bank's share
capital is denominated, namely, the United States Dollar of the
weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966. The Bank has
under consideraticn the effect of the !MF amendments on the
unit of denomination of its capital and the rights and obligations
of members with respect thereto. If the SDR were substituted
for the 1966 United States Dollar in the Bank’s Articles of
Agreement, the Bank’s capital stock would then consist of shares
having a par value of SDR 10,000 each, the value of which in
current monetary terms would vary from day to day
corresponding to variations in the current monetary value o7 the
SDR. Therefore, the Bank's capital stock, expressed in United
States Dollars, couid differ from the amounts shown in these
financial statements. }f such a substitution had been made as of
31 December 1977, the amounts for ‘‘callable’’ shares subscribed,
“paid-in” shares subscribed and total shares subscribed would
have been $5,488 900,000, $1 ,520.200,000 and $7,009,100,000,
respectively, as compared to $5,451,169,936, $1,509,771,151
and $6,960,941,087, respectively, shown in the financial statements. Such a substitution would not then have had a material
effect on the financial position or resufts of operations of the
Bank.

GENERAL

fa)

{b)

{ce}

(d)

Since 1967, the Bank has established Special Funds
Resources to finance the special operations of the Bank
as provided in Article 19 of the Articles of Agreement.
Such Special Funds Resources consist of a Technical
Assistance Speciai Fund and a Multi-Purpose Special
Fund,

In 1974, the Asian Development Fund was established,
Six contributors elected to have their contributions
to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund made after 31 December 1972 credited toward the amount of their contributions to the Asian Development Fund, Accordingly,
their contributions were transferred to the Asian Development Fund.

As a further step to streamline and restructure the
Special Funcs, transfer to the Asian Development Fund
of the resources in the Multi-Purpose Special Fund {with
the concurrence of the relevant contributor} was authorized in 1975. Accordingly, since 1 October 1975, all the
resources in the Multi-Purpose Special Fund, except a
portion of the contribution of Canada, the net income of
the Accrued Resources for the year ended 31 December
1977 and other credit, have been transferred to the Asian
Development Fund. 4

Since the Special Funds Rules and Regulations do not
apply to the Asian Development Fund, the accompanying
financial statements do not include the operations and
activities of that Fund.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

{a}

i a ne tA ltt dT NL i

Unit of Account ~

{b}

{c}

(d)

The Special! Funds Resources financial statements are
expressed in current United States Dollars,

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities and unexpended balances in currencies
other than United States Dollars were translated at the
applicable rates of exchange which prevaifed at the end
of the year.

Income and expense amounts in currencies other than
United States Dollars were translated for each quarter
generally at the applicable rates of exchange which
prevailed at the beginning of the quarter; such practice
approximates the application of average rates in effect
during the quarter,

Translation adjustments relating to funds representing
the unexpended balances of contributions were offset by
increases or decreases in the contribution accounts. Other
translation adjustments were charged or credited to income,

Contributions

Amounts contributed by member countries are included
in the financiai statements as contributions committed
from the date contribution agreements are signed and
related formalities are completed. As to those member
countries which have agreed to consider specific requests
for financing, the amounts shown in the financia} statements as contributions committed are based on the
specific requests approved through 31 December 1977
and 31 December 1976.

Restatement of Certain Amounts
Certain 1976 amounts have been restated to conform to
1977 classifications.

NOTE 3
FECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SPECIAL FUND

Since 1967, contributions have been made by 23 memberAPPENDIX 1-!

in i

countries to be used by the Bank for financing technical
assistance activities. In most cases. the initial use of the
contributions shall be for the procurement of expert
services and facilities from the contributing member
country. There has been, however, a trend towards
liberalization of the procurement terms, Therefore, some
of the contributions are substantially or wholly untied.

NOTE 4 —

MULTI-PURPOSE SPECIAL FUND

{a}

{b}

Since 1968, contributions have been made by 14 member
countries to be used by the Bank for financing special
operations {other than non-reimbursable technical assistance}. However, as 2 result of transfers of contributions
to the Asian Development Fund [see Notes 1(b) and 4
{c)] , a portion of the contribution of Canada is the only
contribution remaining in the Multi-Purpose Special Fund
at 31 December 1977.

The term "Accrued Resources’ refers to the resources
derived from the service fee charged by the Bank in its
special operations in accordance with the Special Funds
Rules and Regulations for the Bank's administration of
the Special Funds Resources and to certain other income
derived from Special Funds Resources credited, held and
administered by the Bank in the Multi-Purpose Special
Fund.

NOTE 5 —

LOANS.

Loans approved by the Bank on concessional terms are
classified as Special Funds loans. Where necessary and
when available, the resources of both the Multi-Purpose
Special Fund and the Asian Development Fund may be
used ejther singly or jointly, to finance such loans.
The amounts shown as “Effective loans held by Bank’
at 31 December 1977 represented only the portions

of loans outstanding which were disbursed trom the
resources remaining in the Multi-Purpose Special Fund.

NOTE 6 —

ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

An Administration Charge to Special Operations was
instituted in 1871. It is based on a formula which takes
into- consideration certain administrative expenses and
the number and amount of loans approved. Upon transfer
of the bulk of the resources to the Asian Development
Fund [see Notes 1{b) and 1 ic], the Administration
Charge Payable to Ordinary Capital Resources applicable
to such resources and contributions was also transferred,
resulting in a net credit arising from such transfer of the
liability.

NOTE 7 —

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

The outstanding commitments, as of 31 December 1977,
for technical assistance (services to member countries)
projects and programs approved by the Bank, were
approximately $10,101,000 ($7,182,000 — 1976}; to the
extent available, contributions to the Technical Assistance
Special Fund may be used to meet expenditures arising
out of the commitments. The amount shown is exclusive
of technical assistance services made available on a
reimbursable basis; however, when technical assistance
rendered as a part of the commitment shown leads to
loans for specific projects, the portion representing the
cost of design and engineering and any balance of
amount aver $150,000 ($100,000 prior to 31 May 1977)
will be converted to the subsequent loan. Under such
options, technical assistance expenditures of $475,344
($304,582 — 1976} were charged to loans and credited
to income of Special Funds Resources during the year
ended 31 December 1977.

In April 1973, the Board of Governors authorized the
establishment of a new Special Fund to be known as the
Asian Development Fund {the Fund). Subsequently,
the Board of Governors also authorized initial resource
mobilization arrangements for the Fund during the
three years ended 31 December 1975 under a two-stage
Programme providing for a total amount equivalent to
US$525,000,000. In April 1974, the Board of Directors
adopted Regulations for the administration of the Fund.
On 28 June 1974, the Fund was established when
Instruments of Contribution were deposited with the
Bank by ten contributors with contributions in an
aggregate amount exceeding the equivalent of
US$225,600,006, this being the minimum amount
required to establish the Fund.

Six contributors elected to have their contributions to the
Multi-Purpose Special Fund mace after 31 December
1972 credited toward the amount of their contributions
to the Fund, Accordingly, their contributions were
transferred to the Fund.

Three contributors have requested and the Board of
Directors has agreed, that the initial use of their
contributions in the First Stage, aggregating the
equivalent of US$105,038,559 at 31 December 1977
(US$104 940,935 — 1976) be restricted to procurement
of goods and services from their respective countries.
¢

Gn 30 June 1975, the Second Stage of the initia! resource
mobilization arrangements for the Fund became effective
when instruments of Contribution were deposited with
the Bank by 11 contributors with contributions in an
aggregate amount exceeding the equivalent of
US$94 000,006, this being the minimum amount required
to bring the Second Stage into effect.

As a further step to streamline and restructure the Special
Funds, transfer to the Fund of the resources in the MultiPurpose Special Fund (with the concurrence of the
relevant contributor} was authorized in 1975,
Accordingly, since 1. October 1975, the Set-Aside
Resources, the contributions of nine contributors, a

(f)

Portion of the contribution of Canada and the
accumulated net income of the Accrued Resources up to
31 December 1876 have been transferred from the MultiPurpose Special Fund to the Fund.

in December 1975, the Board of Governors authorized
the first replenishment arrangements for the Fund during
the three years ending 31 December 1978 under a threeinstalment programme providing for a total original
amount equivalent to US$830,000,000. On 28 June
1976, the first instalment of the first replenishment
arrangements became effective when Instruments of
Contribution were deposited with the Bank by eight
contributors with contributions in an aggregate amount
exceeding the equivalent of US$475,000,000, this being
the minimum amount required to bring the first instalment into effect. On 14 April 1977, the second instalment also became effective after payment of the revised

minimum amount equivalent to US$185,000,000 was
received,

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

fa}

{b}

Unit of Account
The financial statements of the Fund are expressed in
current United States Dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities end unexpended balances in currencies
other than United States Dollars were translated at the
applicable rates of exchange which prevailed at the end
of the year. The capital stock of the Bank is defined
in Article 4, paragraph ¢ of the Articles of Agreement
in terms of the United States Dollar of the weight and
fineness in effect on 31 January 1966. Capital set-aside
was . therefore translated into current United States
Dollars on the basis of 1.20635 current dallars per 1966
dollar {see Note 3).

Income and expense amounts in currencies other than
United States Dollars were translated for each quarter
generally at the applicable rates of exchange which
prevailed at the beginning of the quarter; such practiceAPPENDIX 1-6

 

approximates the application of average rates in effect
during the quarter.

Translation adjustments relating to contributions were
offset by increases or decreases in the contribution
accounts. Translation adjustrnents relating to capita!
set-aside were recorded as receivable from or payable to
Ordinary Capital Resources. Other trans!ation adjustments were credited or charged to income.

{ce} Contributions
Amounts contributed by member countries are included
in the financial statements as contributions committed
from the date contribution agreements are signed and
related formalities are completed.

{d} Restatement of Certain Amounts
Certain 1976 amounts have been restated to conform
to 1977 classifications.

NOTE 3 -CAPITAL SET-ASIDE FOR SPECIAL OPERATIONS

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1{i}, the
Board of Governors has authorized the setting aside of 10 per
cent of the unimpaired ‘’paid-in” capital paid by members
pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(a) and of the convertible
currency portion paid by members pursuant to Article 6,
paragraph 2(b} as of 28 April 1973, to be used as part of the
Specia! Funds of the Bank. The resources so set aside, amounting
to $57,433,902 ($47,609,651 in terms of the United States
Doliar of the weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966),
were allocated and transferred to the Multi-Purpose Special
Fund. On 1 October 1975, these resources were transferred to
the Fund.

In April 1976, the Board of Governors of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) approved proposed amendments to its
Articles of Agreement which will become effective upon the
acceptance by 60 per cent of its members representing 80
per cent of its total voting power. As of 24 February 1978,
approximately 60 per cent of the members of the IMF
representing approximately 71 per cent of its total voting
power had accepted the amendments. Under these amendments,
gold will be abolished as a common denominator of the

 

monetary systern, currencies will no longer have per values, and
all computations relating ‘to currencies of IMF members for
the purpose of applying the provisions of the Articles of the IMF
will be made on the basis of the Special Drawing Right (SDR).
As a result, upon the effectiveness of the amendments to the IMF
Articles, it will no longer be possible to determine, in current
monetary terms, the value of the unit in which the Bank’s share
capital is denominated, namely, the United States Dollar of the
weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966. The Bank
has under consideration the effect of the IMF amendments
on the unit of ‘denomination of ‘its capital and the rights and
obligations of members with respect thereto. If the SDR were
substituted for the 1966 United States Dollar in the Sank’s
Articles of Agreement, the Bank's capital stock would then
cansist of shares having a par value of SOR 10,000 each, the
value of which in current monetary terms would vary from day
to day corresponding to variations in the current monetary
value of the SDR. Therefore, Capital Set-Aside for Special
Operations, expressed in United States Dollars, could differ
from the amount shown in these financial statements. If such a
substitution had been made as of 31 December 1977, Capital
Set-Aside for Special Operations would have been $57,832,000

as compared to $57 433,902 shown in the financial statements.
Such a substitution would not then have had a material effect on
the financial position or results of operations of the Fund.

NOTE 4 —

LOANS

Loans approved by the Bank on concessional terms are classified
as Spacial Funds loans. Where necessary and when available the
resources of both the Multi-Purpose Special Fund and the Fund
may be used either singly or jointly to finance such loans. The
Portions of foans allocated to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund,
representing disbursements in respect of individual loans made
from the resources remaining in that fund, are shown as an
adjustment to the Summary Statement of Loans.

NOTE 5 —

ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

An Administration Charge to Special Operations was instituted
in 1971. It is based on @ formula which takes into consideration
certain administrative expenses and the number and amount of
loans approved.

OPINION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Asian Development Bank:

We have examined the following financial statements of the Asian Development Fund:

Appendix

Balance Sheet, 31 December 1977 and 31 December 1976 1-1
Statement of Income and Expenses and Accumulated Net Income for

the years ended 31 Decembsr 1977 and 31 December 1976 1-2
Statement of Changes in Financial Position for the years ended

31 Decémber 1977 and 31 December 1976 1-3
Summary Statement of Loans, 31 December 1977 1-4
Statement of Resources, 31 December 1977 1-5
Notes to Financial Statements, 31 December 1977 and 31 December 1976 1-6

Our examinations were made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered
necessary in the CHCUNSIANEES:

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly the financial position of the Asian
Development Fund at 31 December 1877 and 31 December 1976 and the results of its operations and the
changes in its financial position for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis.

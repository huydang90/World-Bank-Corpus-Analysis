During 1973, most of the developing memiber
countries of the Bank made a good recovery trom the
generally sluggish econamic performance of the provious
two years. Several developing member countries
achieved a grawth in lheir Gross National Product at rates
that were, in real terms, higher than the 6 per cent target
‘of the Second UN Development Decade; but in many
smaller and less developed countries, there was no
significant growth. In general, however, economic
gains among developing member countries were more
widespread than had been experienced hitherto

The acceleration of economic growth in the region
was closely associated with the rapid expansion in
output in the industrialized countries. This expansion
occurred despite the uncertainties in the exchange
rates of most major currencies, and was accompanied
by strong inflationary pressures, high capacity utilization and, in some cases, supply shortages.

As a result, the export prices of most primary commoditics produced in the region ticreased substantially:
the manufactured exports of the region also benefited
fram the higher prices and expanded markets arising
from the rapid increase in international demand. On
the other hand, the value of imports into the region
rose markedly, due both to higher levels of economic
activity and to increased import prices

On balance, Ihe international trade situation was
generally favorable to the developing member counttics
of lhe Bank. Preliminary estimates suggest Ihat the value
ot exparts from Lhese countries increased by about 48
per cent during the year, while the valuc of imports rose
by about 40 per cent. Moreover. the terms of trade for
some counties improved cansiderably.

Largely as a resull of the improvements in the balance
of trade, the international ieserves of most countries
increased and in many they reached their highest levels
for several years; some countries, however, continued to
have difficult foreign exchanye problems. For the
developing members as a whole (excluding a few
members for which data are not available), lotal
international reserves are likely to have exceeded $10
billian at the end of the year compared with about
$8.3 billion a year ago

The outstanding external public debt of the regional
developing member countries as a whole exceeded
$20 billion at the end of 1972. The total debt service

payments are estimated to have increased from $1.8
billion in 1972 to $2.3 billion in 1973. ,

During the year. most developing member countries
experionced mounting inflation. One majar factor con
tributing to the high rate of price incraase was the
general shortage of basic foods. Although natural
disasters accurred in only a few countries during 1973,
internationally traded basic toods were generally in
short supply and at significantly higher prices, which
seriously attected consumer prices in many of the
food-deficit countries in the regian. Even the traditional
tive exporling countries of Asia had to impose exporl
restrictions in order lo replenish domestic stocks and
to contain price increases.

A second contributing factor was the inflationary
pressure in he industrialized countries which was trarismitted to the regional developing countries through
higher prices both for exporls and imports. Ihe
situation was aggravated by shortages of some im
ported manufactured products and industrial inputs
during the latter half of the year,

Still another contributing factor was lhe expansionary
fisual andl monetary policies that most developing rnember countries followed during the ycar. Government
expenditures and bank credil increased markedly, leading
lo a rapid expansion in the money supply: in some
countries, il reached record levels. To the extent that
additional governmeni expenditures were needed to
alleviate the direct ettects of inflation, il became even
more difficult to mobilize domestic resources for development purposes

One of the unfortunate consequences of this
widespread inflationary trend has been the sleady erosion
in the real value of development expenditures. Although the volume af lending by the multilateral
financing institutions conlinued to grow, mounting
inflaion—esgecially in the developed countries—
seriously diminished the real value of such assistance lo
the developing countries.

Towards the end of the year, the petroleum crisis
dominated the international economic scene. Wilh
one or two exceptions, the Bank's developing member countries were net imporiers of petroleum and
related products in 1973. Increases in the prices of these
products have tended to intensify inflation and may
have scrious effects on producticn, consumption andthe external payments of these countries. Although
some developing members may be in a better position
than others to cope wilh these difficulties. inflation and
the uncertainty in the petroleum siluation are likely to
create additional obstacles to econamic and social progress in the tegion.

Economic policies in many industrialized countries
are being directed towards reducing inflationary pressures, which have, in varying degrees, been heightened
by the sharp increases in petroleum prices. To the
extent that the high rates of economic growth that
have prevailed in the industrialized countries may not
be sustained, Lhe prices of primary commodities will
be adversely affected. On the other hand, an econornic
slow-down in the industrialized countries may not
necessarily lead to reductions in the prices of many
industrial products needed by developing countries, In
such a situation, many developing countries in the
region might again face the prospect of a deterioration
in their terms of trade.

There were, nevertheless. some encouraging developments in 1973 in the international economic scence, For
example. the Ministerial Session of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that met in Tokyo in September
1973 reaffirmed the importance of maintaining and
improving the Generalized Syslem of Preferences, and
the International Monetary Fund's Committee of 20
reported that “itis generally agreed that there is a need for
a reformed world monetary order, based on cooperation
and consultation within the framework of a strengthened
International Monetary Fund, that will ancouraue the
growth of world trade and employment, promote economic development, and help lo avoid both inflation and
deflation ....\' Fresh initiatives were also being made in
the United Nations family and etsewhere for coping with
the recurring food shortages. Success in all these en
deavors can pave the way for an orderly growth and
transfer of resources. giving some promise of a brighter
economic future for developing countries,

LAS HARLSOME LONG-RUN DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS
AND THE BANK’S ACTIVITIES

The effects on the developing countries of the region
of the economic and monetary developments of 1973
point up the underlying tong term social and economic
problems of the region and the need to continue the
efforts af development agencies in seeking solutions to
these problems. Ihe long-term problems are familiar
and many of them are common to most of the Bank's
developing member caunplies, despite their diverse
social and econamic conditions, The Rank’s activities in
rclation to some of these problems are examined helaw,

External Resources

An expansion in the resources needed for a more
rapid growth is still a pressing need in the developing
counties of the region. Although many of the Bank's
developing member counities-—even those at comparatively low levels at income—have besn able to
mobilize considerable domestic savings for investment.
such resources continue lo fall short of the reeds and
must be supplemented by external resources

The Development Assistance Committee ot the
Organisation for Economic’ Co-operation and Development (QECD) has estimated that the ret [Mow fram its
member countries to the Bank's borrowing countries
averaged about $3.4 billion a year during the period
1968-1972. This figuie, however, does not fully reflect
the needs of these countries. Greater efforts hy both
bilateral and multilateral agencies are undoubtedly
necessary. .

The Bank commenced lending in 1968 and by tha
end of 1973. it hac lent $1,376 million. This is about
one-lhird of the total amount leat by riuitilateral agencies
to the Bank's borrowing sountries during the periad. In
the second halt ot this period, the Bank provided nearly
40 per cent of multilateral lending. If the comparison is
made on the basis of lending from ordinary capital resources, the Bank's contribution was $1,056 million —
about 50 percent for the six year period. This steady
growth, Logelher with a recent increase af 150 per cent
in its authorized capital, holds promise that the Bank
will become one of the principal sources of cdevelopmeril assislance to the region.

However, for most of the developing member
countries assistance on conventional terms has entailed,
and continues to entail, the growing problem of debt
servicing. The outstanding external public clebt in the

Bank's borrowing countrics was about $20.8 billion at
the end of 1972. on which the annual debt service payments are estimated to have been $1.6 billion in 1973;
about 300 per cont over the figure for 1968.

ln several developing members, the debt service ratio
has already exceeded 20 per cent of expurt earings.
and a number of the smaller or jess-developed countries
have a low debt-servicing capacity. \n addition, the
Rank’s membership inclides four of lhe counties designated by the UN General Assembly as “least daveloped countries”. Softening the terms of lending to these
countries is a matler of urgent necessity.

The ability of the Rank -ta provide more funds on
sotter terms has been severely constrained by the
limited availability of Special Funds resources. Some
tespile was obtained during 1973 by blending ordinary
resources and Special Funds, loans from the laller being
given on even more concessional terms than in the past.
in order to maintain the earlier level of concessionality in
the Bank's soft lending to individual borrowing countries,
Out of a cumulative total of $389 million of resources in
Special Funds, only $70 million in ‘uncommitted funds
remained al Lhe eid of 1973.

In recognition of the importance of an adequate and
continuing source of concessional funds for the future
activilies of the Bank, an important milestone was
reached in 1973 with the approval in principle of the
establishment of an Asian Development | und, with initial
resources of $525 million for the period 1974 1876. fa
the extent that these additional resources are realized,
the Bank will be better equipped to meet the needs of tts
developing member countries.

Absorptive Capacity

Shortage of the expertise required to formulate, implement and adminisler development projects and programs in developing countries is another constrain in
the development process. The Bank, in several of its
projects, has incorporated specialized ancl on-the-job
training facilities. It is also giving increasing attention to
vocational education projects to imprave technical capacity. Dircet assistance has been provided by the Bank
especially to the smaller and less developed countries in
the farmulalion of projects for financing and in the
assessment of project feasibility. The Bank has conducted and supported 4 number of technical seminars,workshops and training programs for the region. The
further development of institutions to provide a steady
stream of trained cadres for the more effective use of
resources 1s a necessary ingredient in raising the
absorptive capacity of the smaller and less developed
couritries.

Selection of Development Projects

The changing needs of social and economic development in the developing countries, which are vulnerable
lo sudden changes in their economic situation, demand
that the priorities in. respect of projects and programs
be kept uncler constant review

Initially, the lack of physical capital was considered
to be a major constraint to improvements in productivity
and national producl in developing countries. However,
as reflected in the declaration of the UN General Assembly on International Development Strategy for the
Second Development Decade, there is growing awareness that increases in physical capital and aggregate
output alone are not the sole clements in solving decp
rovted social and economic problems—problems that
have become even more acute in many developing
countries in spite of, and perhaps to some extent even
because of growth in the national product.

The improvement of the quality of life of the mass of
the people and the more even distribution of the fruits of
economic progress are basic long-term problems of the
developing world. The increasing pressures of populaticn growth, the low levels of living in general and the
extent of absolute poverty in particular, the degree of
unemployment in both urban and tural areas and the
regional imbalances within the countries, and the uneven
distribution of incames among individuals—atl accentuate these basic problems and demand attention.

The solutions are underslandably hard to find, ard
the apprapriate approach in each case will depend, ta a
great extent, on the stage of development of the country
concerned and the social and economic policies it adopts

While the Rank is cancerned in contributing to the
solution ot many ot these deeper prablems, there are
limits to the scope of its efforts, In selecting developnent projects for assislance. the Bank pays special
attantion to the priorities accorded by the countries
concerned and it also has to satisfy itself on such priorities
and on the technical and economic soundness of such
projects. At the same lime, many of the Barnk-assisted
projects generate direct social benetits: tor example,
tn improving the incomes and living conditions of large
cumbers of people in rural areas, in the provision of waler
supplies end slectric power to smaller urban centers and
outlying areas, and in the development of usually laborirensive small and mediurn-sized industries outside
large population centers,

By the end of 19/3, the Uank had approved loans to
meet the direct and indirect foreign exchange costs of
150 selecled development! projecis in 21 develaping
member countries; these projects cover a wide range of
sectors and contribute not only to increased productivity,
but also lo the urgently-needed social overhead far both
social and ecanamic development

Regional Economic Cooperation
[he diversity of conditions in the regian and the
varying stages of clevelopment in the several countrics of

 

Sri Lenka; Sugar plantation (abeve) and mill at Gal Oya are te be
rehubititated with Bank assistance,

the region Have made the Bank place ils initial emptiasis
on the identification and evaluatian of the possibilities
for economic cooperation among countrics. This has
led te the conpletion of seven studies——sponsored
hy the Bank either alone or in cooperation wiih olher
institutions —on various teatures of the regional economy. These studies include the Asian Agricultural Survey,
the Southeast Asian Regional Transport Survey and the
recently-completed Asian Industrial Survey for Regional
Cooperation. Ihey provide useful bases fer Bank operations within individual countrics, as well as for operations
affecling more than one country and conducive to the
development of future avenues for regional cooperation

The Bank has also sought closer working relations
with other bilaleral and multilateral agencies contributing
to the development of its develoning member countries.
Important areas for such cooperative ettorts include the
posl-war ¢econstruclion and development of the countres in the Indochina Peninsula, anc the onguing
projects in the Lower Mekong Basin.

Although the Bank is now well established as a lending institution capable of taking an increasingly larger
part in the economic development of its region, there is
an immense task ahead for the institution and for its
members. Very much more in the way of resources is
needed, both external and internal. Within these canstraints, however, the Bank must apply its available
resources in the twin causes of economic growth and
social proaress and where the impact will he as widely
beneficial as possible.OPERATIONS AND POLICIES

Lending Operations .
The Bank tent $421.48 tnillion in 1973 compared
with $316.08 million in 1972. The increase in 1973
aver 1972 was about 23 per cent, against an increase
of about 24 per cent in 1972 over 1971. During 1973,
39 projects were financed with 54 loans, against 30 projects financed with 32 loans in 1972. The number of
loans in relation to the number of projects was substantially higher in 1973 because many loans from
Special Funds had to be supplemented with loans from
ordinary capital resources under the Special Funds
Supplementation Scheme (see page 16).

Loans were made to 16 counties in 1973, with
Bangladesh, Burma and Tonga receiving their first loans
from the Bank. twenty-one counties have now
received Bank Joans. Lending by country during 1973
and for the period 1968-19738 Is shown in the Table an
pages 8 and 9.

Total loan approvals passed the $1,000 million mark
on 14 June 19/3, and, by the end of the year, ihe Bank
had made 171 loans totalling $1,3/6.03 million for 150
projects. Of these, 103 loans for $1,056.32 million?
(77 per cent) were from ordinary capital resources ond
68 loans for $319./1 million (73 per cent) from Special
Funds.

The average amount Jent for each project financed by
the Bank continued to increase— $5.9 million in 1968,
$10.5 million in 1972 and $10.8 million in 1973. The
average size of all loans, however, declined from $9.9
million in 1972 to $7.8 million in 1973; loans trom
ordinary capital resources dropped from an average of
$13.9 million in 19/2 ta $10.1 million in 1973, and
loans from Special Funds decreased from $b.9 million
to $4.9 million. This downward trend was duc to the
large number ot projects financed in 1973 with blended
loans under the Scheme referred to above.

ll is significant that the relatively less-developed
countries? among the Bank's borrowing members
received a higher share in total Rank lending during

i Excludes §0.4 million initially approved in 1968 and $0.6 raillion
approved in 19/Q and later mcargoraled in new loans in 1970 and
1571. respectively.

2 Those countries which received loans wholly ar mainly on concessional furms, ie, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Gurma. Indonesia,
Kluner Acpublic, Laos. Nepal, Papua New Guinea. Sri Lanka, Tonga,
Republic of Viet-Nam and Western Samoa.

1973 than during 1972-31 per cent compared with
24 per cent. On a cumulative basis, the share of these
countries in Lota! Joan approvals amounted to 23 per
cent at the end of 1973, compared with 19 per cent at
the end of 1972

Despite the shortage of Special Funds resources,
the Bank's Special Operations during 1973 were not
without notable achievemants. The performance can
be viewed from two aspects: (i) the actual use of Special
Funds resources; and (ii) the application of the Special
Funds Supplementation Scheme during the latter half
of 1973.

In respect of the Special Funds resources as such,
the Bank lent $118.16 million in 1973 compared with
$94.34 million in 1977, a 25 per cenl increase, The
share of Special Funds lending in the total amount of
loans made in 1973 was 28 per cent, compared with

. nearly 3G per cent in 1972. '

However. if the Special Funds Supplementation
Scherne is taken into account, the total amount of
concessional lending in 1973 (inclusive of the blended
loans trom ordinary resources) reached $197.62 million.

In this amount of lending, the concessional benefit to
the borrowers, in terms of the grant element,’ was no
jess than in most Special Operations in the immediate
past. Viewed in this way, concessional Iending in 1973
may be said to have increased by more than 100 per
cent over 19/2.

The largest sectoral share in the amount lent cluring
1973 was accounted for by Transport and Communicatians (29.7 per cent), followed by Industry including
Development Banks (25.3 per cent), Llactric Power
(21.8 per cent), Agriculture (11.2 per cent), Water
Supply (10.4 per cent), and Education (4.5 ger cent).
Compared with the 1968-1972 sectaral distribution,

from the face value of the Joan the discounted present value of the
required amortization and interest payments, this difference being
exprosscu as & percentage af the face value. The disenunt rate ised
by the Bank is 10 per cent a year.

This result occurred largely because of the sharp increase
in 1973 over 1972 of lending to two sectors, Transport
and Communications and Industry including Development Banks.

The Bank's role as a catalyst of productive investment
in developing member countries continued to be significant. At the end of 1973, the total cost of projects for
which the Bank had provided direct financing was
estimated at about $2,514 million, of which the Bank
loans represented approximately 4b percent. In addition,
the Bank had made indirect financing through national
development banks for projects with an estimated total
cost ot $818 million, of which the Bank's loans accounted for about 30 per cent.

The Bank further developed its integrated and comprehensive approach to operations in this sector
with patticular emphasis on rural development and
smajl-halder assistance. Ten loans totalling $47.32
million for seven projects were approved in 19/3, the
highest annual amount since toan operations began in
1968 and an increase of 44 per cent over the amount
approved in 1972. In all, the Bank has approved loans
of $172.05 million for 35 agricultural projects. equivalent to 12.5 per cent of the Bank's total loan approvals.
Almost two-thirds— $110 million —of the amount lent
has been financed fram Special Funds: agriculture
accounts for 34.4 per cent—the largest sectoral share
—vof all loans from Special Funds resources. These
figures include credit lines for agricultural development
banks in Indonesia and Nepal amounting to $5.8
million.

Three projects financed in 1973 were for water
resources and area development. two were for agraindustrial schemes and two were for fisheries development. They were situated in Bangladesh, Indonesia,
the Philiapines, Sri Lanka and the Republic of Viet-Nam.
The projects for water resources and area development
and for agra-industries basically were directed towards
food self-sufficiency and import substitution, and the
two fisheries development projects were aimed at
supplying both domestic and export markets.

The seven projects were financed with six loans for
$30.54 million from the Bank’s Special Funds resources
and four loans for $16.78 million fram ordinary capital
resources. Three projects wera financed with loans
blended fram both resources.

Area development projects financed in 1973 embraced 8 total new area of about 87,700 hectares.

Electric Power

Lending to the electric power sector enjoys a prominent place in the Bank's activities, Since making its
firsL loan for power developtnent in 1969, the Bank
has helped finance 35 projects with loans of $365
million 19 18 electric power utilities at various stages
of growth. Electric: power accounted for 26.5 per
cenl—lhe largest single secloral share—aof the Bank's
cumulative loan commitments at the end af 1973.
Projects have been tailored to meet the generation,
transmission and distribution needs of power systems
of many different sizes, lhe utilities in the region ranging
from 6 megawatts to 2,000 megawatis.

Eleven power projects were assisted with 16 loans
for $92.5 million approved in 1973. Five of the projects approved were for smaller or less develaped systems
in Western Samoa, Laos and in the outer islands of
Indonesia, Financial assistance to the smaller systems
is generally for urgent rehabilitation and expansion
work that will assist local economic development.

The Bank also continued to finance projects for the
larger or more developed ulililiges serving major uibar
areas where load growth has been rapid. Typical utilities
in this category that received Bank loans in 1973 were
the Metropolitan Electricity Authority in Bangkok.
Thailand, ancl the Karachi Flectric Supply Corporation
Ltd. and the Water and Pawer Development Authority
(WAPDA) in Pakistan. In these systems. the largest
consumers of electtical energy are industrial arid cormercial establishments; however, in the case of the
Water anc Power Development Authority the agri
cultural power demands are also large and represent
some 25 pet cent of the total energy supplied.

Following a tequest from the Government of Laos,
the Bank agreed to help mobilize funds trom a number of

donor countries to finance the Phase || extension of the
hydropower facilities at the Nam Ngum power plant and,
when adequate funds— including a possible Bank contribulion—are mobilized, ia coordinale project implementation

During the year, the Bank also extended power loans
to two new member countries — Burma and Bangladesh.

As part of a policy of fostering industrialization in its
developing member countries, the Bank has made loans
to industrial development banks for relending ta smali
and medium-scale industries. Six lodns for $79.6
million to five development banks were approved in
1973 for the Bangladesh Shilpa Bank, the Fiji Development Bank, ihe Medium Industry Bank of the Republic
of Korea, the Development Bank of Singapore and
the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines.
Additionally, the Bank financed 4 fertilizer project in
Pakistan ‘

By the end of 1973, the Bank had made 22 loans
totalling $243.6 million for 20 credit lines to industrial
development banks, and had given ten loans totalling
$99.2 million as direct assistance for nine industrial
projects. The relative share of industry including development banks in the Bank's lending increased
slightly during the year to reach 24.9 per cent at the
end of 1973.

Under the national economic development plans of
most developing countries, a vital role is assigned to
the promotion and development of small and mediumsized industrial enterprises. The foreign currency needs of
this sector have in part been provided by industrial banks,
using the proceeds of tha loans made available by the
Bank. More than in other sectors, such financing by
‘the Bank acts as a catalyst in mobilizing funds for
investment fram other sources and helps both to
create employment and to develop skilled labor,
Also, the development finance institutions assisted
may provide more than finance: they expose the
business community to modern techniques of cor
porate management anc help to improve entrepreneurial skills.

As the industrialization process accelerates, it in
turn increases the demand for foreign exchange for
investment. The Bank has contributed to the infusion
of the additional investment needed by making addi
tional loans in relatively quick succession to its development bank borrowers: six af them had received a second
or third loan from the Bank by the end of 19/3.

As of 31 December 1973. the Bank's credit lines to
development banks had resulted in 424 sub-loans+lo

Fiji: A wtiafount mattress factory in Suva, a beneficiary of financial

enterprises concerned with toxtiles. food processing,
engineering. leather, paper, wood, rubber, machinery
and transport equipment. Most sub-loans had
been utilized to manufacture basic consumer goods
such as textiles and food. products, This has helped
developing member countries, in the first stage, to
substitute for imports of these items and, subsequently,
to build up their potential for exports, thereby strengthening their foreign exchange position. Lately, there
have been more sub-loans fer the manufacture of capital
gocds and intermediary goods, particularly in the
chemical and engineering industries. This development is in line with the industrial advancement of
some developing countries, as reflocted in the gradual
shift in manufacturing from consumer goods to capital
goods. ‘

The $243.6 million the Bank has lent to development
banks will lead to the financing of projects estimated
to cost the equivalent of $818 million.

Transport and Communications

Substantial growth oceurred in the Bank's activity in
the transport and communications sector in. 1973, both
in terms of loan approvals and in ihe range of projects
financed. Twelve loans totalling $125.0 million were
approved for ten projecls, compared with eight loans
totalling $6/.55 million in 1972. This substantial increase in loan approvals is reflected in the increase in the
sector's share of the Bank’s tetal loan approvals, which
rose from 21.4 per cent at the end of 1972 to 23.9 per
cent at the end of 1973. ‘

Of the ten projects approved in this sector, four were
associated with ports in Bangladesh, the Republic ot
Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines: three with roads
in Afghanistan, Malaysia and the Philippines; two with
telecammunications in Tonga and tne ltepublic of
Viet-Nam; and one with an airport in the Philippines.

Most transport projects financed by the Rank have
had the general objectives of opening up new areas and
promoting the developrnent of agriculture and other
economic activity with a view to creating, amung olher
things, new avenues of employment and wider dispersal
af population. Notable among such projects financed tn
1973 are those for the Helmand Valley Road in Afghanistan, Cotabato Port in the Philippines and Kuantan Port in
Malaysia,

The Helmand Valley Road is the first twansport project
in Atghanistan to be financed by the Bank. The Upper
Helmand Valley, in the southern part of the country, is
one of its most productive agricultural regions and the
road, which will traverse the entire lerigth of the Valley,
is expected to help develop the full potential of this
hitherto undeveloped region. In the Philippines, the
Cotabato porl development in Mindanao is expected to
be instrumental in accelerating the devélopment of
agriculturally rich areas in the hinterland of the port,
where the Bank has already financed a number of projects. The Kuantan Port Project in Malaysia is important
for the development of vast areas iri lhe eastern part
of Peninsular Malaysia, where the Government has

    

taken up extensive area development projecis with a
view to generating new economic activities and encouraging migration from congested urban centers.
Increased activity in the sector is attributable partly
to follow-up action on high-priority projects identified
by the Southeast Asian Regional fransport Survey
and partly lo the completion of technical assistance
programs for project preparation approved in 1973 or
earlier. Five projects financed by the Bank in 1973 had
been recommended in the Survey, and three others
resulted from Bank-financed technical assistance.

An adequate water supply is a basic need of any viable
urban community and is vital for many industrial
processes, Water supply also contributes te urban
development in that it facilitates the introduction of
modern sewerage systems. In recent decades, the
marked growth in usban populalion in many of the
Bank's developing member countries has emphasized
the need for expansion in their water supply systems.
Due to lack of resources and the prior claims of other
investment needs, however, sizeable backlogs in in
veslmenl in le water supply sector have developed.
The Bank's first loan to this seclor was extended in
1968 for the Penany Water Supply Project and, by the
and of 1972, approval had been given for nine loans
totalling $110.2 million. These loans were moslly for
medium-sized urban water supply systems such as
those in Singapore, Hong Kong, Busan, Daegu, Penang
and Greater Ipoh, where capacities range from 100,000
to 1,000,000 cubic meters a day (CMD). Financing was
also provided for systems that ranged in size trom
the large urban system of Seoul (2,000,000 CMD)
to the small system of Malacca (below 100,000 CMD)
Loans have been made lor intakes. headwark transmission and pumping of raw water, treatment plants
andl the distribution and pumping of treated waler.
During 1973. six loans for $43.7 million were made to
augment Ihe water supply systems ot Bangkok, Saigon,
Kuching and Sibu (ene loan), and Rangoon. The
Bangkok Project involves parallel financing with the
World Bank. The Bank has now made 16 loans for
$153.9 millicn to finance 13 water supply projects, the
sectors share of total lending being 11.2 per cent
Bank projects for water supply give particular con
sideralion ta the number of people to be benefited,
particularly those in the lower incame groups. Rangoor's
water supply will be more than doubled. The Project tor
Bangkok is the firs] major construction stage in a 30. year
expansion program. Sixty thousand new users will be
provided tor in Saigon. In Malaysia two cities, each
with a population of less Ihan 200,000, will benefit.

Education

Although lending for education is small, the Bank took
steps in 1973 ta provide a groundwork for greater
activity in the sector. To increase its understanding of
the problems of vocational edunation in selected developing member countries, and to identify areas in which
(he Bank could usetutly assist, Education Sectoral
Reconnaissance Missions were sent lo Sri Lanka in
April May 1973 and to indonesia in June-July 19/3

The Mission lo Sti Lanka discovered’ possibilities tor
extending ance for apprenticeship training and
technical institutes, agricultural in-service Laining arn

engineering schools, technical training centers and

\oans uf $6.4 million were approved during the year
tor a vacational eclucation project in Thailand. This
is the Bank’s third education project, the olhers being
for the Ngee Ann Technical College in Singapore (1970)
and for the establishment of five vocational training
institutes, including 4 prolulype training center, in the
Republic of Korea (19/2).

During the year. the Bank began training activities on
its own account with a pilot project for development
bankers organized by the Bank's newly-established
Training Assistance Unil (TAU), (see page 19)

Lending and Operational Policies

In 1973. increasing attention was paid to improving
the planning of all spheres of Bank activity and to seeking
more innovative approaches towards the tasks ahead.
This efforl involves, among other things, a continuous
review of the Bank's lending and operational policies to
make them better suited to the growing and changing
raquirements of the developing member countries, Some
important policy reviews and adaptations to that effect
wore made during the year.

Terms and Conditions

The Hank's fanding rale on ordinary capital resources
remained unchanged during the year, al 7-1/2 per cent
pet annum, despite the worldwide upward trend in
interest rales.

Terms on loans from Special Funds resources continued unchanged tor the first half of the year. In June,
however, in view of the prevailing shortage of Special
Funds resources and pending the coming into eftect of
the Asian Development Fund, a Special Funds Supplementation Scheme was introduced to help the Bank to
carry on Special Operations in 1973.

The Scheme applied to projects whercin the pro
posed Bank financing exceeded $3 million; for cach
projecl concerned. ordinary capital resources were
blended wilh available Special Funds resources in such
@ way that the grant element’ for the package would
reflect the grant element in the Special Funds luaris made
to lhe mernber concerned cither in 19/2 or, where no
Special Funds loan for the member concerned was
made in 19/2, in the period January-June 1973. If
neither of these situations was applicable, an appropriale
grant element would be determined.

Projects to which this Scheme applied were financed,
therefore, by two loans: one trom Special Funds resources and one [rom ordinary capital resources. The
loan from Special Funds carried a rate of interest of 7
per cent per annum {including a service fee of 3/4 of 4
pet cent per annum), an amortization period of 40 years
(including a ten-year grace period), and involved repayment of principal at the rate of 2 per cent per annum
for ten years after tho grace period and at 4 per cent per
annum thereafter. The loan from ordinary capital resources carried the usual charges for such foans and
such amortization period as might be justified. The
proportion of Special Funds to ordinary capital resources
within the total loan package was determined s0 as to
yield an overall grant elemenl determined on the basis
indicated in the previous paragraph

1 See footnote on page 7,

Ihe Scheme was not without its procedural, administrative and procurement difficullies both for the
Bank and the borrowers. It was, however, a lemporary
measure to apply while Special Funds resources remained scarce; iL enabled the Bank to continue, and, in
tact, expand. its lending or concessional terms throughout the whole of 19/3

The Bank’s commitment charge policy -was examined
during the year, with particular regard to the views expressed at the Sixth Anriual Meeting of the Board of
Governors in April 19/3. Asa result. the incidence of the
charge was modified to case the burden on bonowing
countries. Previously, the commitment charge applied
to project loans from ordinary capital resources at the
rate of 3/4 of 1 per cent from a date 60 days after the loan
was signed and was levied an the whole of the undisbursed portion of the loan. Under the revised
policy, which is applicable to loans approved after 30
June 1973, the charge is levied on progressively
incseasing portions of the lean, less the amounis disbursed, starting from 15 per cerit of the loan in the first
year and rising to 100 per cent in the fourth year and
thereafter.

Other Operational Policies

The policy of financing interest arid other charges
leviable during the period ot project canstruclion was
reviewed during lhe year. It was decided that this facilily
should be made available more liberally, and that such
financing should be provided on request in respect of
lending from ordinary capital resources, subject lo
certain exceptions such as lines of credit to development
banks, Itwas also decicled that such financing should not
be provided al present in Special Operations, pending a
raview of policy when the availability of Special Funds
resources improved. In adopting a more liberal approach,
the Board particularly had in mind the need to help thase
meniber countries with a heavy debt service burden
and/or an adverse balance of payments. Such tinancing
affords a certain measure of relief la the country con
cerned by postponing the payment of interest and other
charges until the construction period of the project is
over |t also temporarily alleviales the financial burden
on the project entity concerned

Early in the year, various aspecls of Bank operations
in the less developed of its developing member countries
were considered at length with a view to exploring ways
ancl means for according “special regard” to the needs of
such countries, as required by the Bank's Articles, The
problems and difficulties of such countries were examined and previous Bank operations in the countries
concerned were reviewed. In order to make these operations more effective, consideraliun was given ta a wide
variely of measures, including local cusl financing on
which a staff study was being prepared at the end of the
year.

A review of the Bank's experience in joint financing
was made, covering gerieral policy considerations and
the related operational and technical arrangements.’ The
general policy considerations were examined from
various viewpoints and in relation to various forms of
joint financing. Similarly, procurement airangements
and related matters and aspects of project appraisal,
negotiations and loan administration were examined.

cance tern 20h ete vendetta Lag i An man nadeThis review made it amply clear that, it an appropriate
form of joint financing was available, the Bank could
undertake projects of a larger size. The outcome of the
review was that joint financing arrangements will be
considered on the merits of cach case with due regard to
such matlers as: (i) the operating principles of the Bank,
particularly on procurement and uses of consullants;
(ii} the role and tunctions of the Kank in respect to loan
processing and loan adrainistration; and (iii) diligence
and economy in Lhe execution of projects.

A review was made of those aspects of the Bank's
landing operations relating to the Bank's choice ot
borrowers and the amortization period of loans; in the
case of two-step lending, ie. lending through intermediaries, the review also covered the interest rate and
the amortization period on loans from the borrower to the
beneficiary, and the use ta be made of any counterpart
funds that may accrue to the borrower where relending
terins differed from the terms of the loan made by the
Bank. It was decided to continue with existing practices
in these matters, including the requirement that the Bank
had an obligation to be satisfied as to the suitability of the
relending lerins in the circumstances of each case.

In view of the importancs of the Rank’s growing
operations in the Indochina and South Pacific regions,
two new operational Divisions were created during the
year to provide better coordination of the Bank’s activities
in these two areas.

Post-Evaluation

During the year, a program for the past-evaluation of
completed loan projects was initiated. Under the
program, post-evaluation reports will be submitted to
the Board of Directors. The first report, on the loan lo Sri
Lanka for the Modernization of lea factories Project,
was considered towards the end of the year.

The main purpose of posl-evaluation is to assess how
tar implementation was consistent with the intentions
as reflected in the appraisal of the project, and the extent
to which projects achieved the expected economic and
social benefits. From such reviews of past experience,
turther improvements might be possible in planning and
appraisal techniques and in project implementation

As of lhe end of 1973, disbursements had been completed on 17 loan projects. |t is clear, therefore, that Lhe
program of post-evaluation activities will expand substantially in the near future.

Technical Assistance

The Bank's practice ot providing technical assistance
for the preparation and implementation of projects and
for advisory purposes continued lo be given strong
amphasis in 1873. Altogether, 24 technical assistance
projects (excluding regional activities’) were appraved
in 1973 wilh a tolal cost of $2.60 million, compared
with 16 projects in 1977. Ten commitments were made
for project preparation and 14 tor advisory services
{ineluding nine made in conjunction with Bank loans),

Technical assistance activities covered 12 countries
Bangladesh (five projects); Indonesia (four); the
Philippines (three); Laos, the Republic of Viet-Nam and
Western Samoa (lwo each); and Fiji, the Khmer Republic, the Republic of Korea, Papua New Guinea,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka (one each).

A major project approved in 1973 was a Ports Study in
Indonesia. The Study aims at preparing long term deve
lopment plans far three important ports in Inconesia--Surabaya, Belawan and Panjang—and is being financed
by UNDP with the Bank acling as Ihe executing agent

For the seven years 1967-1973, the total cost of the
technical assistance approved by the Bank (excluding
regional projects) was $13.9 million. In this total,
Agriculture accounts for the largest single share—44.9
per cent Transport and Cammunications for 19.8 per

million. Altogether. leans totalling $207.1 million—
including five loans totalling $15.8 million arising out
of tectinical assistance which was primarily advisory
in nature—have resulted from technical assistance
costing $4.1 million,

Regional Activities

The Bank, in accordance with its obligations regarding
tegional development. has set out initially to acquire a
general view of the econornies of its developing member
countries and then toa examine what practical opportunities exist for projects with a regional or sub-regional
character, :

In establishing the basis for broad regional perspactives, the Asian Agricultural Survey (completed in 1968),
the Study of Southeast Asia's Economy in the 1970's
(completed in 1970) and the Southeast Asian Regional
Transport Survey (completed in 19/1) were of basic
importance. Lach of these surveys was a major undertaking, the first encompassing the entire region and the
two others most of the countries of Southeast Asia.

In addition, a financial contribution was made to the
Asian Industtial Survey (compicted in 1973) conducted
by the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia
aid the Far East (ECAFF), with the Bank being represented on the Consultative Committee for the Survey.

In @ narrower area, the Bank was responsible for a
study of the coconut indusliy in 13 of its member
countries.

The extent ta which, and the time at which, regional
investment projects will emerge from this essential
groundwork is difficull to precict since much depends on
the attitudes of Lhe Countries concerned, Recent developments bear some promise for the future; for
example, the preparations made for the development of
a ferry service between Indonesia and Malaysia, and the
pragress— involving the Bank as administering authority
—-of the Nam Ngum Hydropower Project in Laos, in
which Thailand will be supplied with electric power
surplus ta the requirements ot Laos. In addition, ot
course, the Bank can never be unmindful of the effects
of investment in one country on the economics of other
countries and lhe process of independent, corpretiensive appraisal in itself has regional implicatians of a
pasitive character.

The Bank has also sponsored or supported a number
of regional activities in which member countries have
heen independently associated. Foremosl among these,
because of the scope and potential of their activities in

 

2 pense aethe industrial sector, have been the two Regional Conferences (the fourth and fifth in the series) of the Development Banks of Asia, which the Bank convened in
Manila in 1969 and 1973, respectively.

Regional Workshop on Irrigation Water
Management '

The ADB Regional Workshop on Irrigation Water
Management started on 8 January 1973 at the Headquarters of the Bank in Manila and conciuded on 27
January 1973 in Jakarte. It was one of a continuing
series of efforts to ensure that, in accordance with the
lessons derived from the Asian Agricultural Survey, the
benefits from agricultural investments were maximized
and were felt at grass-roots fovel,

The Workshop's two major objectives were: (i) to
help expedite the successful implementation of Bankassisted irrigation projects; and (il) to catalog field
experiences that weuld help improve the Bank’s pro_ cedures for the preparation and implamentation of irrigation projects.

There were 19 participants, of whom 13 were grojact managers involved in Bank-assisied irrigation projects in ten member. countries, three were outside experts
and three were Bank staff members; observers from the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Mekong Commitise were also present for some of the discussions. The Warkshop visited eight irrigation projects and
four agricultural research stations in the Philippines, Thailand and indonesia and had 28 field discussions on
various subjects relating to Irrigated agriculture in Asia.

Progress in 13 irrigation projects assisted by the
Bank was closely reviewed. Four elements were emphasized as éssential for the successful implementation
of en irrigation project: (i) a well-conceived agricultural
development program and the early implementation of
pilot schemes; (ji) the timely completion of terminal
irrigation networks; (ili) the strengthening of farmers’
organizations and education: and (iv) job-site and overseas training of project personnel.

!n general, the Workshop provided a valuable opportunity for exchanges of ideas, information and cxperience, from which, the participants. and the Bank
projects on which they are engaged, should beth benefit
greatly. A report of the Workshop, including Guidelines
for Irrigation Projects. has been circulated by the Bank.

Fifth Regional Confersnce of Development
Banks of Asia ‘

As proposed at the Fourth Regional Conference of
Development Banks of Asia, the Bank convened the
Cifth Regional Conference at its Headquarters in Manila
from 14 to 17 August 1973.

The basic objective of these conferences is to provide
a forum in which senior officials from the development
banks of the region can exchange views on subjects of
mutual interest. The growing importance of promotional
activities of developrnent banks provided the main subject for the Fifth Conference. A theme paper entitled
“Operational Experience of Development Banks——Pro-blems Encountered in the Promotion of Industrial Development” based on case studies prepared by a number of
developrnent banks in the region was discussed and

1 Approved in 1972,

attention was focussed on three main problems: (i) the
identification and development of viable projects; (ii) the
development of entrepreneurs; and (iii) the organization
of projects,

During their deliberations, delegates alsc emphasized
the need for and the problems involved in the development of small-scale industries, the creation of new jobs
through, labor-intensive industries, the promotion of

export-oriented industries and the balanced growth of _

different regions within each country.

Participating in the Conference were 68 representatives from 32 development banks in the region, seven
nan-regional development banks and institutions and
nine international organizatians, including the United
Nations, the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), the United Nations Industrial Development
Organization (UNIDO), and the World Bank Group. A
Summary of Proceedings has been issued by the. Bank.

The Conference requested the Bank to convene the
Sixth Regional Conference in two or three years in
consultation with a Liaison Group of Development
Bankers set up during the Conference.

The Bank's Training Assistance Unit {TAU} was
established early in 1973 in accardance with recommendations made by the Fourth Regional Conference of
Development Banks of Asia. [nitially, TAU will have the
tasks of identifying training requirements among the
developing member countries and arranging appropriate
training facilities.

Regional Workshop for Small and Medium
industry Project Development

The Training Assistance Unit started its operational
activities with the implementation in November and
December 1973 of a Regional Workshop for Small and
Medium Industry Project Development. The Workshop
was held in cooperation with the Development Finance

Institute of the Private Development Corporation of the ,

Philippines (PDCP), Manila. Sixteen participants from
nine development banks in the region attended. The
training program was of practical nature, ernphasizing
specific techniques pertinent to the different aspects of
project appraisals; case studies were provided by leading
development banks in the region.

Nam Ngum Hydropower Project

An important new role assumed in the year by the
Bank was that of coordinator for the second phase of the
Nam Ngum Hydropower Project in Laos, Following a
Tequest from the Government of Laos, the Bank agreed
to assist in mobilizing resources for the second phase of
ihe Project and, when adequale resources were mobilized, to undertake the role of coordinating the execution of the Project. Earlier, the Bank had been represented at the pledging meeting organized by the Mekong
Committee and held in Bangkok. In October 1973, the
Bank convened a meeting of contributors in Manila to
expedite the mobilization of contributions and the determination of appropriate arrangements for project implementation. The meeting was attended by representatives of Australia, Canada, France, the Federal Republic
of Germany, India, Japan, Laos, the Netherlands, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United Stales; New
Zealand and the Mekong Committee were represented as
observers. At the meeting, participants pledged or

1920

renewed pledges for contributions totelling approximately $24.3 million and reached agreement on the
broad arrangements regarding the use of such contributions in the implementation of the Project.

Asian Productivity Organization Training Course

The Bank approved a lechnical assistance grant of
$30,000 to the Asian Productivity Organization (APO)
for the Fourth APO Project Feasibility Study Training
Course, similar to the course described in the Annual
Report for 1972. The Third Course was held in Manila
from-40 to 30 January 19723 and in Tokyo for a further
four weeks. and was attended by 29 trainees from 12
APO member countries.

The Fourth Course wes scheduled for JanuaryFebruary 1974.

Commodity Balance Sheets

The Bank agreed to participate with ECAFE, FAO and
the Institute of Developing Economies (IDE) in Tokyo
in a project to compile commodity balance sheets.
The Bank's contribution consists of a grant to finance the
services of professional personnel required for the task,
The Project is expected to lead to improvements in
the quality of data of this kind available in the region on
the production and utilization of, and trade in, agricultural commodities, minerals and manufactures.

List of Regional Activities 
By the end of the year, the Bank tad undertaken 20
cifferent regional activities, as shown in the Table on this
page.

Developments in regard to activities approved before
1973, including action taken by the governments as
follow-up to the Southeast Asian Regional Transport
Survey, are described in the following paragraphs,

Southeast Asian Regional Transport Survey

In consultation with the Governments of Southeast
Asian countries, the Bank continued to follow up the
recommendations of the Southeast Asian Regional
Transport Survey. It was represented at the two
meetings of the Coordinating Committee of Senior
Transport Officials of Southeast Asiart Countries
(COORUCOM} held during the year—the 14th meeting in Jakarta in June 1973 and the 15th meeting in
Saigon in November 1973—at which progress on
regional and national projects identified by the Survey
was reviewed. Discussions were held with governments on specific projects identified by the Survey.

In addition to projects previously laken up for finaneing. loans were extended during the year to five more
projects recommended in the Survey: (i} East-West
Highway, Malaysia; (ii) Kuantan Port, Malaysia; (iii)
Yarlac-Santa Rosa and Feeder Roads, Philippines:
(iv) Cotabato Port Development, Philippines: and {v)
Manila {nternational Airport Development, Philippines.
The Bank also took up a sludy to prepare long-term
master plans for three important ports in Indonesia,
namely, Surabaya, Belawan and Panjang. (See also

finance the recruitment of expert professional staff.
As astarl, and in cunsullalion with lhe Bank and SEATAC,
UNDP has agreed to give preparatory technical assistance to SEATAC to enable it to propare a three-year
work program based on a detailed examination of the
specific regional projects to be followed up in consultation with participating governments. The work program will provide a basis on which the Bank, UNDP and
other agencies should be able to consider requests for
further technical assistance for SEATAC.

Trans-Straits of Malacca Ferry Service

Field work on the feasibility of a ferry service across
the Straits of Malacca, which would run from Belawan
in North Sumatra to Penang in Malaysia, was completed during the year and a draft report. prepared bythe consultants, was submitted to the governments of
the two countries concerned. The report was considered at a joint meeting of the governments in August
1973, at which jt was concluded that the ferry service
was highly desirable and should be implemented as
soon as possible. Due to site difficulties for a ‘ferry
lerminal at Penang and a proposed reduction in the
size of the ferries suggesled by the consultants, additional technical studies to scale down the recommended
investment will be necessary, To prepare the project
in the manner proposed, the Bank has suggesled that
SEATAC should be requested to undertake the additional

technical studies, with Bank staff assistance if necessary.

LAWASIA Credit and Security Research Project

The Credit and Security Nesearch Project undertaken
by the Law Association for Asia and the Western Pacific
(LAWASIA) was substantially completed during 1973.
The Editors of the Projact submitted national reports
and an integrated report to the Bank.

The Project involved a study of the credit and security
attangemenis available to national development banks
and similar financial institutions. The countries studied
were Australia, the Republic of China, Indonesia, Japan,
the Republic of ‘Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri
Lanka and Thailand

The Bank provided financial assistance, technical
advice and administrative assislance lo LAWASIA to
implement the Projact. The ford Foundation also
assisted the Project.

Interagency Cooperation

: One of the Bank's tunctions under its Articles is to
cooperate with the United Nations. its organs and subsidiary bodies, including in particular the Economic
Commission for Asia and the Far East (LCAFE) and
with other international and national institutions, both
public and private, Interested in development financing tr
the region,

Pursuant to this provision, the Bank has maintained
close relations with the Werld Bank, whose pioneering
role in the multilateral financing field has been of
particular value to tha Bank, and with the other regional
development financing institutions, especially, among
the multilateral institutions, the Inter-American Development Bank and the African Development Bank

The annual consultation—the fourth in the series
between the Presidents of the Inter-American Development Bank, the African Qevelopment Rank and the Asian
Development Bank was held in Nairobi, under the chairmanship of the President of the African Development
Bank at the tirne of the 1973 annual meelings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. The
Senior Vice President of the World Bank also attended.

The Bank has kept in close touch with ECAFEF and
with other United Nations organs and Specialized
Agencies whose activities are of interest to the Bank in
its work. Specially important has been the growing cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme, for which the Bank is functioning as the
executing agent for an increasing number of UNDPfinanced projects. A special relationship exists with
the Food and Agriculture Organization, with which the
Bank concluded an Interim Arrangement for Cooperation in 1968.

International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD)

Cooperation with the World Bank has conlinued to
expand and diversify.

Frequent consultations were held during the year
on lending programs in several countries to ensure
maximum coordination, Members of a number of World
Bank missions visited the Bank, usually on return from
assignments in the Bank’s member countries, to discuss
their findings and to share views with the Bank.

ADB-IBRD cuoperation in the joint financing of
projects expanded turther. During the year. loans were
approved for two projects in which the Bank became a
co-lender with the World Bank—the Bangkok Water
Supply Project in Thailand and the Multan Fertilizer
Project in Pakistan. In the Bangkok Water Supply
Prajecl, the World Bank component mainly covers water
treatment aspects and the provision of financial and
management consulting services, while the Bank's
component mainly covers the construction of trunk
mains, distribution pipefines and groundwater wells. In
the Multan Fertilizer Project. the distribution of responsibllities consists largely of financing separate plants.

The Bank and the World Bank have a continuing joint
project on the colleclion and campilation of external
debt data from the developing member countries of the
Bank. It is planned to begin using a revised Manual
for Reporting External Debt and Grants in 1974.

United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP}

Cooperation with UNDP strengthened during the
year, and involved exchanges of information on projects
and reviews of country programs and the Bank's
designation as the Executing Agent for several UNDP financed projects. Consultations between Bank missions
and UNDP Resident Representatives were held more
frequently under a policy agreed upon by the two institutions. Efforts continued ta be made to draw more
oxtensively on UNDP pye-investinent ard feasibility
sludies in the Bank’s operations.

The Bank was represented as an observer at the
Regional Meeting of UNDP Resident Representatives
during the year. The Bank also participated in the
UNOP Expert Meeting on Coordination of External
Resources for the Philippines.

The Bank has so far assurned the role of executing
authority for four projects—one each in Indonesia,
Laos, the Philippines and the Republic of Viet- Nam----involving financing by UNDP of $2,199,300. UNDP
had earlier contributed $1.1 million towards the cost of
the Bank's Southeast Asian Regional Transport Survey.

The Bank continued to act as Executing Agent for the
UNDP-financed Laguna de Bay Project in the Philippines. Within the framework of the Memorandum of
Understanding relating to pioncer agricultural projects
in the Mekong area, under which the Bank became Lhe
delegated Lxecuting Agency of IBRO for the Ga Cong
Pioneer Agricultural Project in the Republic of Viet Nam
in 1972, the Bank assured a similar responsibility for
the Casier Sud Pioneer Agricultural Project in taos in
March 1973. During the year, the Bank also became
Exccuting Agent for a UNOP-financed study for the

2122

long term development of the ports of Surabaya,
Belawan and Panjang in Indonesia.

Mekong Committee

In connection with its operations in | aos, the Khmer
Republic, Thailand and the Republic of Viet-Nam. the
Bank has continued te maintain close conlact with the
Commiltes for Coordinatian of Investigation of the
Lower Mekong Basin. Ihe Bank is participating with the
World Bank in developing a series of pioneer agricultural
projects in Laas, the Khmer Republic and the Republic of
Viet-Nam, using funds provided by UNOP. This program arose mainly trom initiatives taken by the Mekong
Committee. In the case of one of these projects, the
Go Cong Pioneer Agricultural Project, for which the
RBank—as the delegated Executing Agency—had
earlier extended technical assistance, a Bank loan of
$2.1 million was approved in 1973.

Another important related activity during the year was
the Bank's assumption of the role of coordinator for the
second phase of the Nam Ngum Hydropower Project in
Laos (see page 19). A pledging meeting, at which the
Bank was represented, was organized by the Mekang

  

_ Committee in Bangkok on 31 May 1973 and the Bank

itself convened a further meeting of danors in October.

During the year, Rank representatives attended an
informal meeting of the Mekong Committee held in
Bangkok in March and the 62nd Session of the Committee held in Tokyo in April.

Others

Cooperation with other agencies and institutions
continued during the year, mainly through Bank participation in selected symposia, conferences and meetings.
The Bank was represented at the 29th Session of
ECAFE and al Lhe meetings of Ihe Transporl and Communications Commitiee and the Sub-Committee on Tourism
and Facilitation of International Traffic, Bank representatives also participated in the 13th Soulh Pacific Con

sponsored by the United States Agency for International
Davelopment, and the Interagency Consultation Meeting en the FAO propesal regarding international action
to assure adequate basic food stocks. Bank cooperalion
during the year with the International Labour Organisation (11.0) was mainly in the form of a technical
assistance contribution to the latter's Comprehensive
Employmerit Strategy Mission to the Philippines. The
Bank was represented at the meeting of experts sponsored by the Development Assistance Committee of
OECD to review aid evaluation policies and procedures,
Discussions were held with the Asian Institute for
Fconomic Development and Planning to explore passibilities for future Bank cooperation in the activities of the
Institute.

During the year, Bank representatives attended meetings of aid-consortia and consultative groups for Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines. Sri Lanka and Thailand, a
meeting of aid-giving countries and institutions convaned by the Gavernmant of Bangladesh and the Donors
Meeting on Foreign Exchange Support Fund and Post
War Reconstruction of the Kamer Republic.

Loan Administration

As a result of continuing elforts to accelerate the
utilization of approved loans, there were significant
increases in 1973 in the amounts of contracts awarded
and in disbursements, The increase in disbursements
was particularly substantial, ftom $61 million in 1972
to $146 million in 1973. As proportions of net effective
loans, conlracts awarded and disbursements were 44.6
and 28.2 per cent, respectively, in 19/3 campared with
levels of 38.5 and 19.4 per cent in 1972. Details of
contracts awarded and disbursernents by the end of
1973, in relation to loans that became effective in
the period 1968-1973, are shown in the lable on page 23.

In 1973, disbursements were compleled on seven
loans; at the end of the year, there were 17 closed loans

Loan cancellations were $6.59 million, consisting
mainly of amounts left undisbursed after closing of the
laans and a reduction in the emount of one toan.

Ouring the year, 54 review missions were mounted,
compared with 56 in 1972, to follow the progress of,
as well as to examine problerns and difficulties encountered in, project executian.

Etforts were made in 1973 to provide more information at an cartlier stage of project processing.
For the benefit of prospective suppliers of goods and
services, press releases issued when loans are approved
now, contain considerable additional information, re
lating. in particular, to the consultant services and
procurement involved in the projects concerned

Realizing the need to accelerate the pace at which
contracts have been awarded so that the rate of disburserment will be further improved, the Bank began a
review of procurement practices and procedures to
determine, in the light of past experience and the rapid
changes in international marketing conditions, possible
improvements.

| Cunency realignments posed some problems relating
to the evaluation of bids and to cost overruns, Because
of unstable exchange rates, it became necessary to
provide borrowers with a flexible and more appropriate
basis for comparing bids. {t was decidecl, therefore, to
amend the Bank's Guidelines on Procurement:so that,
in the evaluation of bids, the Borrower may either:

(i) apply exchange rates prevailing at a reasonable
date (say 30 days) prior to the date fixed for the
opening of bids and make arrangements whereby all prospective bidders may receive notification of such rates at a reasonable time (say 15
days) before the date fixed for the opening of
bids: or

{ii) apply exchange rates prevailing on the date of
opening of bids, providing that any subsequent
change in exchange rates occurring before the
decision to notify the succassful bidder of the
award of the contract, should be taken into
account,

In relation to cost overruns on Bank-financed projects, simptified procedures were adopted for approving
supplementary loans of up to $500,000 or the equivalant of 10 per cent of the original oan amount, whichaver
amount was lower, in cases where the cost overrun was
due to currency -realignments and price increases. Floor
limits were grescribed in regard to the amount of the
cost overrun that might be considered for financing by
the Bank (over $100,000 or equivalent to 5 per cent or
more of the original loan).

In collaboration with the International Federation of
Consulting Engineers (FIDIC), the Bank organized a
mecting with consulting firms to discuss such basic
questions as the Bank’s procedures for the identification
and preparatian of projects, the relative roles of consulting firms and individual experts, the Bank's practices
and procedures for selecting consultants, the role of
domestic consulting firms and the relationship between
consultants and government agencies.

Practices and proceduros rolating to the uses of
consultants by the Bank and ils borrowers were reviewed in 1973. The Bank’s Guidelines on the Uses of
Consultants were amended to the effect that: (i) other
things being equal, preference shall be given to domestic
consullants or combinations of cansulting firms including
consultants fram both developed and developing member countries: (ji) the names of firrns to be solicited for
proposals shall be submilled ta the beneficiary for
comment and statament of any objections before the invitations or proposals arc sent out; (ili) selection of the
most suitable proposal shall be on the basis of technical
qualifications (i.¢., plan of approach to work, proposed
work schedule, experience and capability of personnel
to be assigned and quality of supervisory loadership ta
to be furnished} to perforrn lhe work, salher than on
the basis of the best known ar the most experienced
firm: and (iv) representatives of the beneficiaries shalt
be invited to participate as observers in the negotiations
with cansultants for Bank technical assistance activities.
A further review of certain aspects of the Guidelines is
contemplated in 1974,

AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Capital

The Bank's authorized capital stock was
$3,385.71 6,500 on 31 December 1973. The subscribed
capital was then $2,/24,855,126, having increased by
$275,530,340 during the year as a result of subscriptions: (i) from new members; (ii) te a special increase
in the capital stock by ona member, aad (iii) fram
additional subscriptions to the capital increase authorized in 1971?

Bangladesh became a member of the Bank on 14
March 1973 and subscribed to 3.750 shares valued
at $45,238.125.

Burma became a member of the Bank on 26 April

The British Selomon Islands Protectorate became a
member of the Bank on 30 April 1973 and subscribed
to 26 shares valued at $301,687.50.

The Board of Governors, By Resolution No. 55
adopted on 16 February, authorized 2 special increase
in the capital stock of the Bank by $48,264,000,
divided into 4,000 shares. The full amount authorized
under the Resolution was subscribed by the Republic
of Korea, 32 per cent of which was gaid-in shares
payable in four equal annual instalments and 68 per
cent in callable shares. he first instalment of the
paid-in portion was paid on 6 April.

By the and of the year, 32 members had subscribed
to the capital increase authorized by the Board of
Governors in Resolution No. 46 adopted in November
1971. Subscriptions to the increase were
$1,421.164,745 at the end of 1973. Twenty-nine
members paid the first instalmants of the capital
increase during 1973 and three members exercised
the oplion under special arrangements approved by
the Board of Governors (Resolution No. 53 adapted on
9 November 19/2) to make payments of the paid-in
portion of their subscriptions to the capital increase
in two equal inslalments, lhe first of which is to be
paid not later than 6 April 1978 and the second not
later than 6 April 1976.

| in addition, there was a restatement of capital subseribed betore 19/3
due (o the devaluation of the United States dollar used as the Bank's
unil af ecvount (see page 25}; the restatement had the effect of
increasing the subseribed capilal by $744,§34,929.

Fxtensions of the time for subscribing to the increase
in authorized capital stock were approved by the Board
of Governors under Resolution No. 56 adopted on
20 February 1973, Resolution No. 65 adupted on 28
August 1973 and Resolution No. 69 adopted on 18
December 1973. Under Resolution No. 6%, the closing
date for subscriptions was extended to 30.June 1974.
As at the end of 19/3, six members had vet to exercise
their right to participate in the capital increase.

Borrowings

The Bank made two borrowings in 1973

In April, thea Bank raised 20 million United States
dollars by the sale of 6-3/4 par cent Two-Year Dollar
Bonds at par to the central banks and government
agencies of regional members. This issue was the
Bank‘s second issue of two-year bonds within the
region, being the roll-over of the $20 millian Two-Year
Dollar Bonds of 1971.

In September, the Bank accepted the offer of a United
States dolar loan equivalent io 200 million Austrian
Schillings from the Government of Austria. [he loan
is for a term of 16 years, including a five-ycar grace pe
riod, at 4 per cent interest per annum, and is to be drawn
down in two tranches, THe first tranche was paid on
1 October 1973 in the amount of $5.6 million, which
was equivalent to 100 million Austrian Schillings at
the dollar-schilling exchange rate of the Austria
National Bank in eftect on that date. The second
tranche was paid on 2 January 1974 and was in the
amount of $5.0 million.

In view of the high interest rates prevailing in the
major capital markets since the early part of the year,
the Bank's borrowing operations remained restricted.

Sales of Loans (Loan Participations)

The Bank continued its practice of seeking participations in project loans made from ordinary capital
resources. Parlicipalions, which are in the form of
salas—in United States dollais—of the early maturities
of project loans, are sought from commercial banks and
other institutions at the same rate of interest as the
Bank charges its borrowers. Such participations cdo
not carry the Bank's quaraniee of repayment by
borrowers.On account of high interest rates, new participations
secured by the Bank in 1973 were only of the order of
$900,000. Six loans were involved. At the. end of
the year, aggregate loan participations of $14.01
million had been arranged for 26 project loans: $9.82
million Rad been collected from participants to meet
the disbursement claims of borrowers and $3.88
million had been repaid to participants in earlier loans.

Early in the year, the queslion of loan participation
atrangements was considered in relation ta the Bank's
liquidity position, !t was agreed that, although loan
participations were nol then necessary to replenish
resources, efforts to seek such participations could
continue in order to sustain the interest of commercial
banks and other institutions in the Bank. The Board
of Directors authorized the sale of portions of loans,
without the Bank’s guarantee, up to a maximum aggregate of $20 million.

Accumulated Income and Ordinary Reserve

Under the provision of Article 40 of the Articles of
Agreement,.the net income of the Bank for the years
1987 Lhiough 1972—aggregating $48,146,285—was
allocated to the Bank's Ordinary Reserve in terms of
resolutions adopted by the Roard of Governors at the
FirsL through the Sixth Annual Meetings. As a result of
restatements of the Bank's capital stock (see Section
below on Unit of Account), an amount aggregating
$13,180,045 was charged against the Bank's Ordinary
Reserve. At the end-of 1973, therefore, the Bank's
Ordinary Reserve was $34,966,240. The net income
for 1973, $15,657,480 (see Section below on Income
and Expenses and Appendix 1-11), is available [or
allocation hy the Board of Governors.

Loan Disbursements and Repayments
During the year, disbursements? on loans to member
countries were $120.3 million, bringing total disbursements to $239.0 million as of 31 December 19/3.
Gorrowers repaid $6.8 million to the Bank during
1973, bringing total repayments to $10.0 million.

Member Currencies

Follawirg the de facto devaluation of the Uniled
States dollar on 12 February 1973, adjustments of
exchange rates have taken place in respect of the curren
cies of mast member countries. The Bank has adopted
the new exchange rates of the currencies of member
countrics for translation of currencies and maintenance

of value purposes at new par values, new central 
rates, markel rales or at the rates used in making
payments of the first instalment of subscriptions to
the increased capital ot the Bank

During the year, action was taken as required for
maintenance of value selliernenis in regard to several
cunlencies,

Unit of Account
Frorn the inception of the Bank in 1968 to 7 May

"19/2, its unit of account was the United States dollar

with a gold content of 0.888671 gram of fine gold.

1. For disbursements on loans fron Special Funds. see page 30.

Consequent upon the devaluation of the United States
dollar in 1972 and 1973, the unit of account from 3
May 1972 to 12 February 1973 was the United States
dollar with a gold content of 0.818613 gram of fine
gold, and after 12 February 1973 was the United States
dollar with @ gold content of 0.736662 grarn of fine
gold. Since the Bank's capital is defined in the Articles
of Agreement (Article 4, paragraph 1) in terms of the
United States dollar of the weight and fineness in
effect on 31 January 1966, namely. with a gold content
of 0.888671 gram of fine gold, the capital stock of the
Bank was restated in terms of the United States
dollar used as the Bank's unit of account by an increase
of 8.57 per cent in 1972 and by a further increase of
411.11 per cent in 1973. An important effect of such
restatement of the capital stock, and also of the re
translation of other currencies in terms of the Bank's
unit of account, has been a net charge of $5,769,477
in 1972 and of $7,410,568 in 1973 against the Ordinary
Reserve of the Bank.

Liquidity Policy

The liquidity policy adopted in 1972 was reviewed
early in 1973.: Note was taken of the consideralions
having a direct bearing on the Bank's liquidity position
and of the need for the Gank to project a sound financing
image in the capital markets. It was decided to continue
with the policy adopted in 1972, namely, that the
Bank's liquid assets would be maintained at not less
than two-thirds of three years’ projecled loan disbursements. The policy would continue to be reviewed
annually,

Investments

At the end of the year, the Bank's investments—
held in 19 convertible currencies and in one nonconvertible currency — totalled the equivalent of
$409,893,326, of which 28 per cent was field in government securities of government-quaranteed obligations
of member countries and 72 per cent was held in
time deposits or certificates of deposit of banks in
rember countries and with the Kank for Internalivnal
Settlements.

Ot the total investmenis in government securities
or government-guaranteed obligations of members,
37 per cent was invested in securities maturing within
one year and 63 per cent was invested’ in securities
maturing after one year, of the jolal investments in
time deposits or certificates ot deposit of banks in
mamber countries and with the Bank for International
Settlements, 60 per cent was invested in deposits
maturing within one year and bO per cent was invesled
in deposits maturing after one year.

Income and Expenses

Gross income for the year was $46,280,868. Aller
deducting $1,841,653 as commissions appropriated to

Restructuring and Resource Mobilization
Proposals .

In the Annual Report for 1972, reference was mada
to the need for restructuring the Bank's Special Funds
to create a more appropriate and effective framework
for the financing of concessional lending operations.
lt was indicated that the Board of Directors was
studying proposals in this regard, and that discussions
had started with poterilial contributor countries on
procedures for organizing the mobilization of Special
Funds resources, Significant progress towards these
goals was made in 1973 and, by the end of the year.
there were grounds for confidence that a successful
conclusion would be reached during 1974.

As a preliminary measure, steps were takan to wind
up the Agricultural Special Fund. This Fund had
served a useful purpose in Lhe initial stage of the
Bank's concessional lending operations, both as 3a
symbol of the importance attached by the Bank to
agricultural developrnent in Asia and as a means of
attracting resources for financing such development
The Bank’s lending recard in the agricultural sector
now furnishes sufficient evidence of the importance
the Bank attaches to agricultural development, and
the existence of a separate Agricultural Fund no longer
accords with the organizational and administrative
requirements of [he Bank as it enters 3 new stage of
growth. [Recognizing this, two of the existing contributors to the Fund (Japan and the Netherlands)
agreed early in the year to transfer their contributions
to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund. With lhe - repayment of a small amount still due to Denmark on
account of its original loan contribution. the way was
clear for the formal termination of the Agricultura!
Special Fund. This accurred on 2? May 1973.

Meanwhile, at the Sixth Annual Meeting in April,
the Board of Governors took a decision of far-reaching
signiticance for the develapment of a sound financial
structure tor the Bank's concessional lending operations
when it approved in principle the establishment of an
Asian Development Fund. This new Fund is conceived
of as a pool of reciprocally untied resources cornlributed
initially by developed member countries and periodically
replenished: the Fund would be drawn upon by the
Bank to finance all its concessional loans in accordance

 

with policies and procedures approved by the Board of
Directors from time to time. Acting-on a recOmmendation of the Board of Directors, the Governors adopted
Resolution No. 62 outlining the principles that should
govern the proposed new Fund, At the same time,
the Governors urged potential contributors to cooperate
with the Gank in arriving at mutually acceptable
arrangements for an initial mobilization of resources for
the Fund, sufficient lo cover the Bank’s concessional
lending program up to the end of 1975. ,

The Bank continued its discussions, initiated in 1972,
with potential donors on arrangements for mobilizing
resources for the Asian Development Fund. Meetings
with representatives of most of the Bank’s developed
member countries were held in London, Manila and
Bonn under the chairmanship of the Special Advisor
to the President, Sir John Chadwick. The discussions
at these meetings were characterized throughout by a
full appreciation of the significance—for the future of
the Bank and its ability to carry out its role in Asia
effectively—of the goals which the Bark has set for
itself, by a firm willingness to assist the Bank in attaining
these goals, and by a pragmatic approach to the
resolution of difficullies thal lie in the way. At the
conclusion of the meeting in Bonn, 14 of the Bank's
developed member countries were abie to join in a
declaration accepting, as the basis for recommending
such legislative action as may be necessary, a detailed
resource mahilization scheme.

The scheme as negotiated was then put forward by
the Board of Directors for approval of the Board ot
Governors, and was duly adopted by the Governors in
two Resolutions on 20 November 1973. The Resolulions
authorize the Bank to accept initial contributions from
developed member countries to the Asian Development Fund, in a total amount of $525 million. The
contributions are to be made available to the Bank
under a program divided into two Stages. Contributions to the First Stage, in an aggregale amount of
$350 million, are to be committed to the Bank by
30 June 1974 or such later date as the Board of Directors
may delermine, and will become effective when total
commitments of at least $760 million have been
reecived. Contributions under the Second Stage, in an
aguyregate amount of $176 million, are to be cornraitted

Asia Developnwent Fund: Representatives of developed member cowirivs meet in Bown to diseusy arrangements for mobilizing Special Funds resources.

lo the Bank hy 30 June 1975 or such later date as the
Board of Directors may determine, and will become
offective when total commitments of at least $130
million have been received. The Asian Development
Fund itself will come into existence only when con
tribution commitments under the First Stage become
effective.

Ihe arrangements approved by the Governors
reflect, inter alia, the inevitable difficulties of moving
from a practice whereby individual Special Funds
contributions have been made in amounts and on terms
conforming te no prearranged pattern, to an, organized!
system for mobilizing resources on uniform terms. fii
particulary, having regard ta legislative action that was
already in process in one important donor country when
the negotiations began, it has bocn necessary to make
provision for the acceptance, in exceptional cases, of
lied contributions under the First Stage of the pragram
Ihis Stage can therefore be regarcled as a transitional
phase, during which contributors will have an opporlunily 10 fulfil earlier plectges. With the caming into effect
of the wholly untied Secand Stage ct the prograrn, the
Bank will have fully achieved its objective of a truly
multilateral Fund,

Another noteworthy teature ot the resource mobilization arrangements results from the fact that. although
they are designed to cover [he operational requirements
of the Bank for [he three-year period ending 31 Decem
ber 1975, they will not in fact come into effect until
the second year of the period. Provision has bean made
te bring within the scheme amounts contributed to the
Multi-Purpose Special Fund on the old bilateral basis
after 31 December 1972, by permilting the contributor

the option of crediting such amounts towards its share
in the multilateral resource mobilization, By exercising
this option, [he contributor will agrea to the autamatic
transter of such amounts to the Asian Development
Fund upon its inception, in full or partial satisfaction—
as the case may be—of ils commitment to the Fund.
As of the end of 19/3, it appeared that cantributors
would wish to exercise this option in respect of about
$65 million contributed to lhe Multi-Purpose Fund
during the year. The amount of new resources accruing
to the Bank in 19/4 and 1975 under the resource
mobilization arrangements will be commensurately
reduced

When the scheme outlined above is substantiatly
realized, a new instrument for development assistance
in Asia will come into existence. The Special Funds
resources of the Bank will become a fully effective
coumerpart of its ordinary capital resources, and the
financial structure envisaged for the Bank at its inception
will be complete, With these adclitional resources at
its disposal, the Bank will be in a position tu mount an
organized program of concessional lending for the
economic and social advancement of its least developed
member countries, rising from the 1973 level of $118.16
million to $200 million in 1974, and ta $250 million in
18/5. No less important, the Bank will be in a position
to extend this assistance on terms which more fully
recognize lhe financial burdens thal these countries
have to bear, and on conditions that are more flexible
and tesponsive to their needs. This is a challenge the
Bank will readily accept. Whether it will have an
oppurlunity lo do so depends now upon the abilily of
the Liank's develapedl member countries la come for-ward with the contributions authorized by the Board
of Governors within the time trame envisaged in the
tesolutions. :

Resources for 1973 Operations

Pending the establishment of the Asian Development Fund, the Rank conducted concessional lending
operations in 1973 with the financing arrangements
that had applied in the past. The result was a further
illustration of the difficulties of mounting a coordinated
and fully effective operational program without the
advance assurance of adequate funds. The fact
that the Bank succeeded in expanding its concessional
lending operations in 1973 is largely due to the generous
support again extended during the year by a major
contribulor, Japan, arid to the adopfian, in the second
half of 1873, of a scheme for blending loans from
Special Funds resources with loans from ordinary
capital resources, without detriment to the overall
tevel of concessionality.

At the end of 1972, as was pointed oul in last year's
Annua! Report, the margin between the Bank's concessional loan commitments and the value of the Special
Funds resources available to cover those commilmenis
had shrunk to little more than $20 million. Devaluation
of the United States dollar, in which the Bank's foan
commitments are expressed, had the immediate effect
of increasing the Bank’s commitment capacity. Additianat resources made available to the Multi-Purpose
Special Fund during the year amounted to about $143
million, of which nearly $28 million represented further
amounts set aside from the Bank's ordinary capital
resources, the balance being contributed by six member
countries. After taking account of Special Funds loan
commitmants of $118.16 million made during the year,
the Bank ended 1973 with some $70 million in uncommitted Special Funds resources at its disposal with
which to undertake Special Operations in 1974.

These figures do not fully reflect the realities of the
situation throughout 1973. While one effect of the
currency realignment in February was to increase the
commitment capacity-of the Bank, another was to
teduce substantially the purchasing power of amounts
previausly commilled for Joan projects, and this has
sincs led to requests for additional loan financing to
cnable those projects to be completed. Also, continuing
fluctuations in exehanye rales make it essential for the
Bank always to maintain an adequate reserve of
resources uncommitted in order to minimize the
possibility of over-commitments as a result of a depreciatian in value, in relation to the United States
dollar, of its Special Funds holdings. Moreover, of
the contributions made in 1973, more than half were
received by the Bank only in December, and these
were not effectively available for lending operations
in 1973.

in February, @ substantial contribution of Y12
billion was received from Japan. Four other developed
member counties became contribulors to the MultiPurpose Spacial l‘und in the early part of the year,
bringing the total number of such contributors to
thirteen. Finland agreed to make available FMk
6,160,000 payable in three equal annual instalments,

and tied to procurement in Finland. Italy contributed
an amount in lira equivalent at the time of payment
to $1,800,000, anid Norway contributed NKr 12 million,
each of ihese amounts being available for financing
procurement in those developed member countries
which are contributors to the Multi-Purpose Special
Fund, and in developing member countries of tha Bank
(as is the amount contributed by Japan). The contri
bution of Switzerland, in an amount of SwF 20 million,
may be used for financing procurement in all member
countries of the Bank. At rates prevailing at the end
of 1973, the individual amounts thus contributed by
these five donors were: Japan, $42,857,143; Finland,
$1,599,480; Italy, $1,698,586; Norway, $2,095,155;
and Switzerland, $6,472,840.

Notwithstanding the additional contributions received, it seemed likely by April that available Special
Funds resources would not. be sufficient to enable
operational demands in 1973 to be satisfied. Accordingly, at the Sixth Annual Meeling, the Board of Governors
toak action, for the third time, to authorize the setting
aside of additional amounts from the Bank's ordinary
capital resources, pursuant lo Article 19.1(i) of the
Articles of Agreement, and the transfer of such amounts
to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund, The set-aside
action applied to 10 per cent of the capital paid in by
members under Article 6.?(a) since the time of the
previous set-aside action in 1971, and 10 per cent of
the convertible currency portion of the capital paid in
by members under Article 6.2(b}. The amount yielded
by this action was $27,85/,940. The freely useable
amount that may be set aside from the present capitalization to the Special Funds, within the limits specified
in the Articles of Agreement, has now been substantially
exhausted.

In June, a further review was held within the Bank
of the prospects for cancessional lending operations
during the remainder of the year. It was recognized
that. in view of the tight resource position, exceptional
ingasures would be necessary if the Bank was to fulfil
the expectations of its developing member countries
for financial assistance on concessional terms. The
Special Funds Supplementation Scheme described
elsewhere was introduced in an eftort to increase
the cangessianal {ending capacity of the Bank.

Thirteen projects invalving total concessional financing ot $138.57 million were financed under the Scheme,
using only $70.31 million fromm Special Funds, with the
balance of $69.26 million being drawn from ardinary
capital resources. Lffectively, the $118.16 million
committed for Special Funds loans during the year was
used to extend project assistance of $197.62 million on
a concessional basis, and the Bank was thus able to
sustain the expansion in its concessional lending
activities.

By the end of November, in spite ot the Special
lunds Supplementation Scheme, the resource position
was again giving rise to concern, A review made al
{hat time confirmed that, although the Bank would be
able to complete its 1973 operations, the amount of
uncommitted resources available, for 1974 would be
negligible. In December, however, Japan found it
possible to make a further generous contribution of
¥15.4 billion ($55,000,000) to the Multi-Purpose

29Special Fund, on the same basically untied terms as its
contribution in February. This assured the Bank of
sufficient resources to carry on during the early months
of 1974, hopefully until the First Stage of the Asian
Development Fund mobilization comes into effect.

fn the latter part of the year, the Netherlands made
twa separate contibulions to the Multi-Purpose Special
lund in an aggregate amount of 17,320,000
($6,132,053). These contributions were made tollowing an understanding reached with the Bank in 1970,
when the Netherlands, with the concurrence of Indonesia, indicated its willingness to provide assistance
in respect of commitments made by the Bank for de
velopment projecis in Irian Jaya (West Irian). The
total amount pledged by the Netherlands at that time
was 17,500,000. The Multi-Purpose contributions
followed approval by the Board of Directors of con
cessional loans for the Irian Jaya Power Project and
the Irian Jaya lisheries Development Project. The
balance of the pledged amount was contibuted by
the Netherlands to the Technical Assistance Special
lund to reimburse the Bank for cosis earlier incurred
in extending technical assistance for the Power
Project.

 

Multi-Purpose Special Fund

With the additional resources received during the
year as described in the preceding paragraphs, the
Multi-Purpose Special Fund had resources of $389.3
million as of 31 December 1973. Of this amount.
$331.9 million represented contributions from 13 of
the Bank's developed member countries, and $57.4
million represented resources set aside from the Bank's
ordinary capital, The Multi-Purpose Special Fund re
sources are summarized in the Table on page 31.

Of the contributed resources, ttiose made available by
Australia, {inland and New Zealand are strictly tied to
procurement in the contributor country. During the
year. Canada agreed to some liberalization of the terrns
of its contribution, which is naw available lo finance
procurement not only in Canada but also in developing
member countries of the Bank. The contributions of
the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are available
to finance procurement in con(ribulor countries on a
reciprecal basis, and in develaping member countries:
those of Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of
Germany, llaly, Japan and Norway may be used to
finance procurement in all contributor countries (wilhout a requirement for reciprocity) and in develaping
member countrics. The resources contributed by
Switzerland, like those set asicle from the Bank's
capital, may ba used for financing procurement in all
member countries. This diversity of terms underlines
the impartance of establishing at the earliest possible
date the uniform, reciprocally untied, system enviseged
tor the Asian Development Fund, and of bringing all the
existing Multi-Purpose resources within that system in
due course.

Utilization

During 19/3, the Bank financed 24 projects in 12
countries with loans from the Multi-Purpose Special
Fund. Oescriptions of these projects, which were
primarily in lhe power, waler supply and agricultural
sectors appear elsewhere in this lteport. |he distribution
of Special Funds loans at the end of the year, by country
and by sector, is shown in the Table on page 32. The total
amount committed in loans in 1973 was $118.16 million.
Disbursements in 19/3 were $26 2 mitlion, bringing total
disbursements from Special Funds to $43.74 million.

The Technical Assistance Special Fund again proved
its value to the Bank as a source of finance for technical

Organization

In June 1973. two new Divisions were created in
the Operations Department. One of thase Divisions
covers the area embraced by the countries of Indachina,
where it is anticipated that the Bank's operational
activities will increase. It is alsa intanded that this
Division will be a focal point for coordinating and
collaborating with other organizalions in the effort to
channel development resources and assistance for the
projected post-war secenstruction of the area. The
other new Divisinn was created to cover the smaller
and less developed member countries of the Bank in
the South Pacific arca. At the same time, there was
a redistribution of countries lo be covered by the tive
existing Divisions in ihe Operations Department to
achieve a balanced allocation of work and responsibilities
and to provide for ncw member countries such as
Bangladesh and Surma.

The Agricultural Division in the Projects Department
was disbanded and in its place were sel up General
Agriculture and Irrigation Divisions to strengthen the
Bank's efforis in lhese sectors.

Until September 1973, the Econatnic Office hed
been heavily engaged in supporting the operationa!
responsibilities of the Operations and Projects Departmenis. This function mace a definite contribution to
the Bank’s operational activities bul affected the ability
ol the Economic Office ta concentrate and specialize
on its olher furictions. Accordingly, the Economic
Office was relieved of this supporting functian in
September to enable it to devote primary allention to
conducting research relating to the problems and policies
of social and economic development and to the
methodology used for analytical work within the Bank.
At the sare time, the Leonomic Office was charged
wilh the task of carrying out independent post-evaluation of Bank-financed projecis (see page 17).

Staff

The Bank added 15 professional and 18 supporting
staff in the course of the year. {hese additions brought
the number of staff to 622, consisting of 222 protessionals
and 400 supporling staff, representing 34 nationalities.

In response to the rise in the cost of living and
relevant competitive factors, general increases in salaries
of supporting staff and professional staff were made in
June and August, respectively. {!mprovemenls were
also made in the education grants for the school
children of professional slaff and in the dependency
allowances jor the dependents of supporting staff.
Minor increases were approved in allowances [os
business travel and in insurance coverage on shipments
of household goods and on accompanied and unaccompanied baggage. These increases were made necessary
by rising costs.

Supplementary Budget for 1973 and
Budget for 1974

On § November 1973, a Supplementary Budget for
1973 was approved, authorizing additional Internal
Administrative Expenses of $770,00Q because of unexpected requirements for consultants, the general salary
increase granted to the staff and increases in other administrative expenses associated with the Bank's occu
pancy of the new headquarters building.

The Budgel for 1974 was approved on 27 November
1973 and is summarized in Appendix 2.

In compiling lhe 1974 Budget, an effort was made to
look beyond 1974 and provide for the first stage of
an increase in manpower and facilities that would
be coordinated with the projections of the Uank's
future operational activities.

Internal Adrninistrative Expenses for 1974 are cs
timated at $13,477,200! a 17.8 per cenl increase over
the previous years revised budget Inis increase is
due to the Bank's increasing activities and to the need
for 20 additional professional staff mernbers for the
Operations and Projects Uepartments. It also reflects the
full-year effect of the general salary increases granled
in 1973 and lakes into account further possible increases
in staff benefits and increases in the cost of various
supplies

Disbursements on Services to Member Countries
during 19/4 are estimated at $4,420,900, a 50 per cent
increase over actual disbursements in 1973.

Headquarters

With the transfer in mid-1973 of some of the Bank's
offices to the South Wing. the Bank now occupies the
whole of its new headquarters building.

The 1973 Annual Meeting of the Roard of Governors
was the first Annual Meeting to be held in the auditorium
of the Headquarters.

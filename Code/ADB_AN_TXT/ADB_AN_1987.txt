aidThe Asian Development Bank

The Aslan ‘Development Bank, an international partnership of
47 members countries, 's engaged in promoting the economic and
social progress of Its developlng member counties in the Asia-Pacific
region, . .

The Bank started functioning in December 1966 with its Headquarters in Manila, Philippines. {t is owned by the governments of
32 countries from the Asia-Pacific region and 15 countries from Europe
and North America.

In 21 years of operations, the Bank has became a major catalyst
in promoting the development of the most populous and fastest grawing region in the world today. The Bank's principal functions are:
(i) to make loans and equity investments for the economic and social
advancement of developing member countries; (ii) to provide technical
assistance tor the preparation and execution of development projects
and programs and advisory services; (lil} to promote investment of
public and private capital for development purposes; and {Iv) to
respond to requests for assistance in coordinating development polices
and plans of member countries, In its operations, the Bank is also
required to give special attention to the needs of the smaller or less
developed countries and give priority to regional, subregional and
national projects and programs which will contribute to the harmonious
economic growth of the region as a whole.

The financial resources of the Bank consist of ordinary capital
resources, comprising subscribed capital, reserves and funds ralsed
through borrowings; and Special Funds, comprising contributions
made by member countries, accumulated net income and amounts
previously set aside from the paid-in capital. Loans from ordinary
capital resources, which account for 67 per cent of Bank lending,
are generally made to member countries which have attained a
somewhat higher level of economic development. Loans fram the
Asian Development Fund are made on highly concessional terms and
almost exclusively to the poorest borrowing countries.

The Bank has boriowed funds for its ordinary operations from
the capital markets of Europe, dapan, the Middle East and the United
States. The Bank's callable capital, which at the end of 1987 accounted
for nearly 88 per cent of its subscribed capital, backs its borrowings
in the capital markets,

The Bank's operations cover the entire spectrum of economic
development, with particular emphasis on agriculture, rural development, energy and social Infrastructure, Most Bank financing is designed
to support specific projects. In certain cases, the Bank also provides
program, sector and multiproject loans.

‘The Bank actively pursues co-financing activities with official as
well as commercial and export credit sources, The Bank has also
entered into equity investment operations,

The Bank’s highest policy-making body is its Board of Governors which meets annually, The direction of the Bank's genera! operations is the responshbbility of the Board of Directors — composed of
12 Directors (each with an Alternate} — elght representing regional
countries and four representing non-regional countries. The Board
of Governors conducts an election for the Board of Directors every
two years.

The President of the Bank is elected by the Board of Governors
for a term of five years, after which he may be re-elected, The President is Chairman of the Board of Directors and under Its direction
he conducts the business of the Bank. In this he is assisted by the
Vice-Presidents, who are appolrted by the Board of Directors on the
recommendation of the President.

The Bank has 24 departments and offices — including a Resident Office in Dhaka, Bangladesh, a South Pacific Regional Office
in Port Vila, Vanuatu, and a Resident Office in Jakarta, Indonesia —
deating with various operational, financial, administrative and general
support functions,A

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS |

THE Board of Governors is vested with all the powers of the
Bank, With the exception of certain powers specifically
reserved to them under the Charter of the Bank, the Board
of Governors has delegated {ts powers to the Board of Directors which is responsible for the direction of the general operations of the Bank. The Board of Directors performs its duties
on.a full-time basis at the Bank's Headquarters and meets in
formal session under the chairmanship of the President of the
Bank.

The Board of Governors elected a new Board of Directors
at the Bank’s Annual Meeting in Osaka. It took office for two
years on 1 July 1987. A list of the 12 Directors and their Alternates follows this Chapter, while Appendix 4 to this Annual
Report provides more details on Board membership and
voting groups.

For the first time, the People’s Republic of China elected
a Director and appointed an Alternate Director to take part
in Board dehberations. The entry of the People's Republic of
China required a reorganization of one of the existing chairs:
Sri Lanka joining the constituency chaired by the Republic
ef Korea; Maldives joining the constituency chaired by
Pakistan; Viet Nam and Lao PDR joining the constituency
chaired by India; while Afghanistan has yet to join any
constituency.

General

The Board approved 49 government-quaranteed loans
totalling $2,418 million for 45 projects, eight equity investments amounting to $22,8 million! and three accampanying loans to private sector entities withoul government
guarantee for $20.5 million, and 141 grant-financed technical
assistance projects amounting to $41.8 million, of which $15.8
million is being provided from non-Bank sources.

The Board approved five borrowings totalling the equivalent
of $537.2 million in Swiss francs, Japanese yen, Deutsche
mark, pounds sterling and Kuwaiti dinar. The Bank's pounds
sterling issue was lis first borrowing in the Euro-sterling market.

 

1 Excludes an underwriting commitment of $4 inillion in the Aslan Development Equity Fund,

Notable Events

The Bank’s first two loans to the People’s Republic of China
were approved in 1987: $100 million to the China Investment Bank to provide assistance to small and medium-sized
industrial enterprises and $33,3 million for the Fue! Conversion Project to convert oilfired generating facilities to
coal-fired,

In an effort to assist the development of the capital markets
of Its developing member countries (DMCs), the Bank’s recent initiatives in that area were reviewed. An investment of
$5 million in the first mutual fund created by the Bank — the
Asian Development Equity Fund - - was approved along with
an underwriting of up to $5 million. Total funds raised in the
international markets exceeded $100 million.

Policy Review

During the course of the year, the Board conducted a
number of reviews on financial issues. Karly in the year an
indicative borrowing program of up to $800 million was ap
proved; however, as financial requirements developed, only
five individual borrowings totalling $537.2 million were
deemed necessary. In an effort to lower the lending rate to
its borrowers, the Board approved the swapping of certain
existing borrowings in high-cost currencies for those with a
lower cost, primarily Swiss francs.

The Board also undertook a review of the Bank’s net income targets and loan charges and concluded that certain loan
charges could be reduced slightly while maintaining the credit worthiness of the institution. As a result of the reduction in
charges, lower borrowing costs In 1987 and certain swap transactions, the variable lending rate was lowered from 7.65 per
cent at the end of 1986, first to 7.36 per cent in the first half
of 1987 and then to 7.03 per cent in the second half of the
year.

The Board of Governors in 1986 instructed the Board of
Directors to begin a reylew of the Bank's financial and operational needs, with a view to submitting a general capital increase proposal to the Governors at an appropriate date.During 1987, the Board of Directors reviewed the Bank’s
operational plans and priorities for the late 1980s and a
preliminary paper on projected ordinary capital resources
(OCR) operations in the perlod 1987-1995, Other papers on
the organizational, staffing and financial irciplications will be
reviewed in 1988 and beyond as the role of the Bank in
meeting the changing needs of the region becomes clearer.

Recognizing that the needs of the region were changing fast,
and that this would require changes in Bank policies and procedures, several Governors at the Twentieth Annual Meeting
called for a review of the Bank’s role in the region in the 1990s
by a panel of distinguished outside experts. The Board approved the setting up of an external expert panel comprising
representatives from a cross-section of member countries and
is under the Chairmanship of former Foreign Minister of
dapan, Mr. Saburo Okita.

The Board actively reviewed the lending policies of the institution and, as a result, approved a revised policy on program lending. The sew policy supplements the Bank's traditional project-based lending with loans that are based primarily
on structural reforms in a particular sector of a borrower's
economy. Prograrn lending is limited to no more than 15 per
cent of total Bank lending and the policy will be reviewed after
two years.

Discussions also were imitiated during the year on
implementing a limited pragram on guarantee operations by
the Bank, Guarantees were envisioned in the Bank's Charter
but thelr scope had earlier appeared limited. However, with
changed circumstances in the capital markets, it was thought
that opportunities existed for certain borrowers to receive
Bank-guaranteed funds fom commercial sources on more
favorable terms than they could recelve otherwise.

The Bank in recent years has increased its efforts to assist
its small island members, primarily the South Pacific developing member countries (SPDMCs), for wham It recognizes it
has a special responsibility. Many of these economies suffer
disproportionately from natural disasters that impede their
development. The Board, after reviewing the Bank's assistance
to small DMCs, approved expedited procedures to provide
limited rehabilitation assistance to smal] nemnber countries in
this situation,

Reflecting the underlying trends in member countries, Bank
aperations in the private sector have assumed increased visibility and importance in recent years. Equity operations were initialed in 1983 and lending without government guarantee
in 1986. In 1987 the Board conducted a review of policies
on credit lines to development finance institutions (LI-Is}
through which most of the Bank's support te the private sector
flows. It recoramended, inter alia, that the Bank’s future operetions should be guided by the broader objective of contributing
to the evolution of efficient DMC financial systerns. The Board
also conducted an interim review of private sector operalions
and recammended changes designed to increase the competitiveness and marketablhty of Bank services. Changes included reducing the minimum size of Bank loans and fending
spreads and adoption of summary procedures fur small loans
and investments.

A (urlher review of private sector operations is expected
in 1988. Alang with the Increasing recognition of the private

sector's vital role in economic growth has been the realization that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) fill an important niche in the development process. The Board
endorsed a variety of measures to ensure greater and more
effective cooperation between the Bank and NGOs,

As mandated by the Board of Governors, the Board: of
Directors reviewed arrangements for Jeriding from the Asian
Development Fund (ADF), Technical Assistance Special Fund
{TASF} operations funded by ADF contributions and ADF
lending terms. The Board agreed that the maturity of ADF
loans to ADF-only countries would continue to be 40 years,
whereas for those countries receiving a blend of ADF and OCR
resources the maturity of ADF loans would be reduced to 35
years. Both Indonesia and the Philippines, although Group B
counties, were made eligible for limited ADF assistance during
the replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (ADF V},
in recognition of their recent economic difficulties.

Discussions on the question of special capital increases for
certain members continued throughout 1987 and will continue into 1988.

The Board reviewed the progress of implementing the
previous year's review of policies and procedures in managing the environmental aspects of Bank-supported development projects.

Administration

On the recommendation of the President, the Board reappointed Mr. S. Stanley Katz as a Vice-President of the Bank
for a term of two years from 1 April 1988.

The Board approved a 5 per cent increase in salary and
an adjustment of the dependency allowance for professional
and supporting staff. The Board also reviewed the Staff Retirement Plan and approved improved pension benefits.

The Board approved an addition to the capital expenditure
programm to upgrade the Bank's cornputer and office autornaliyn systems during the period 1986-1988.

Directors’ Visits

Short visits were made to the following DMCs by small
groups of Directors tu erable them to obtain a first-hand impression of the Bank’s operations. The participants also held
discussions an relevant policy issues with DMC authorities:

{i} Burma and Nepal - 24 January to 8 February
(i) Pakistan and Bangladesh - 17 October to 1 November

Committees

During the first half of 1987, the Koard had three committees: the Audit Committee, the Budget Review Committee
and the Committee on Admministralive Matters Relating to
Members of the Board (CAMB), each consisting of five Directors or Alternates. After discussion with the incoming Board,
the President recommended, and the Board agreed, that the

is shown in Appendix 5 of this Annual Report.

The Audit Committee examined the Bank’s financial
statements and the scope of the outside audit, considered
various internal audit matters and reviewed the work of the
Post-Evaluation Office, including 14 Project Performance
Audit Reports. The Committee recommended to the President on its review of Post-Evaluation Reports that an additional project category, “unsatisfactory”, should be added to
the exlsting categorles of “generally successful” and “partially
successful”. In accordance with its terms of reference, the
Committee also advised the Board on the appointment of Outside Auditors for 1988 and the recommendation was accepted

The Budget Review Committee examined in detail the proposals of the 1988 Administrative Budget for which an expenditure commitment of $98.4 million was submitted for
Board consideration. In recommending the 1988 Budget, the
Committee emphasized, inter alia, the need to adjust the staff
mix to the changing requirements of Bank operations while
continuing to exercise economy and efficiency in budgetary
matters,

Prior to being disbanded, CAMB, among other activities,
reviewed the provisions for shipment allowances and insurance
on Appoiniment, Termination and Official Travel. Its recommendation was approved by the Board and the revised provisions were subsequently incorporated in a revised edition
of the Handbook on Directors’ and Alternate Directors’ Administrative Matters.

THE BANK IN 1987

DURING 1987, Bank lending commitments including private
sector loans rose 22 per cent to $2,438.5 million.

This sharp increase reflected high borrowing levels in four
developing member countries (DMCs) — Bangladesh, India,
Indonesia and Pakistan — which together accounted for
$1,776.9 million, or nearly 73 per cent of the total lending.

The Bank also approved ils first two loang to the People’s

During the year, 52 loans were approved for 48 projects
in 17 DMCs compared with the same number of loans and
projects in 19 DMCs in 1986. The average loan size increased to $46.9 million from $38.5 million the year earlier. The
size of individual loans ranged from $2 million for a private
sector loan to Pakistan Industrial Leasing Corporation Lid.
to a $190 million loan to Indla for the Railways Project.

Co-financing increased slightly to $498 million from $492
tnillion In 1986. Official sources of co-financing fell by 25 per
cent to $286 million from $379 million in 1986, and their
share of total co-financing dropped to 57 per cent fram 77
per cent the year earlier. Co-financing from commercial
sources, at $212 million, rose substantially over the $113

with 23 per cent a year earlier. :

Ona sectoral basis, loans to the transport and communicattons sector more than quadrupled to $793.9 million in 1987
from $178.8 million a year earlier. The share of this sector
rose to 33 per cent from 9 per cent in the same period. This
was attributable to the approval of four Jarge-scale ioans of
$100 million or more. India received two loans for railways
and ports development totalling $277.6 million.

Lending te the industry and non-fuel minerals sector also
rose steeply to $645.5 million in 1987 from $110 million a
year earlier, while the seclor’s share of total lending rose to
26 per cent from 5 per cent in the same period. The sharp
rise was due mainly to a surge in lending to development
finance institutions — both established and new borrawers —
as a result of improved industrial prospects in many DMCs.

1986. The share of total lending almost halved to 22 per cent
from 41 per cent in 1986. The change reflects year-to-year
programming fluctuations in this sector rather than any change
in Bank priorities or in sectoral demand.

Lending to the energy sector fell to $331.7 million from
$515 million in 1986. The decline in the sector's share of total
leriding to 14 per cent from 26 per cent did not reflect a fall
in load growth but rather the deferral of a few projects due
to unresolved policy issues with the governmetits concerned.

Landing for the soctal infrastructure sector — water supply
and sanitation, urban development and housing, education.
and health and population — dropped to $135.7 million
trom $272.5 willion in 1986, while the percentage share
declined to 6 per cent from 14 per cent in the same period.
The fall was due to lhe economic downturn in many DMCs
which fed to cutbacks In infrastructure projects which are

The implementation of Bank-financed projects proceeded
satisfactorily in several DMCs in 1987. in others, progress was
impeded by such problems as a shortage of counterpart funds,
manpower and institutional constraints, cumbersome procedural requirements which delayed the awarding of contracts
and the appointment of consultants, lack of coordination between line agencies, unfamiliarity with Bank procedures and
reguirements, pOor performance of contractors, cost overruns
and technical problems during construction. Steps taken by

DURING 1987, the international economic environment
generally remained difficult for developing countries as growth
in world output continued to slow down. Reflecting the
deterioration in the external environment, the economic
growth of the developing world was also slower. The Bank’s
developing member countries (OMCs), however, exhibited
healthy economic growth in 1987, which averaged at about
the level achieved in the previous year. Further, their aggregate trade balance improved considerably and their overall
inflation rate remained moderate

Most DMCs pursued fiscal and monetary policies consistent with the goals of achieving intemal and external balance
Most DMCs also adopted industrial and trade policies
faciltating greater private and foreign investment and a greater
orlentation towards exports. These policies generally emphasized improving the investment environment and promoting industrial efficiency, The DMCs also made efforts at
enlarging the scope of market mechanisms and expanding the
role of the private sector,

The International Setting

In 1987, the world economy continued to face large flictuations in exchange rates, sharp imbalances in trade and
payments, persistent protectionism and rising external indebtedness. The widely held expectation that the collapse of the
global stock market would result in a decline in consumption
and investment demand has prompted many forecasters lo
revise their growth projections downwards.

The worldwide recovery which begai in 1983 Jost further
momentum in 1987. Growth in world output declined to 3
per cent from 3.2 per cent in 1986 and 3.3 per cent in 1985,
However, growth in the volume ef world trade increased to
47 per cent in 1987 from 4.5 per cent in 1986, reflecting
higher exports of both primary and manufactured goods.
Rapidly expanding exports of the newly industrializing countries (NICs) contributed to this growth,

Solutions to the problems facing the world economy will
require relatively large economic adjustments and fundamental
policy changes in both Industrialized and developing countries. In 1987, the major industrialized countries tock a series

of steps aimed at expanding coordination of their economic
policies. This was a continuation of the process which began
with the Plaza Accord of September 1985 when the finance
ministers and central bank governors of the industrialized countries concerned decided on measures to lower the value of
the dollar as a means of reducing the trade deficit of the United
States. In February 1987, after nearly one and a half years
of relatively rapid depreciation in the value of the dollar,
atternpts were made at the Louvre meeting to stabilize exchange rates at around their prevailing levels. This intention
was reaffirmed by the heads of seven major industrialized

In association with these agreements, Japan announced in
May a ¥6 trillion package aimed at stimulating domestic demand which was accompanied with measures aimed at apening further the Japanese market to imports. It also announced
increases in its financial resources to be channelled to developing countries over the subsequent three years. Towards the
end of the year, the Federal Republic of Germany announced
that it would increase the size of its tax cut already scheduled
for 1988, and later led a round of interest rate cuts in European countries. In November, the United States announced
a package of measures for reducing Its budget deficit by
$76 billion over the following two years,

The large changes in exchange rates that occurred during
1986 and 1987 have begun to influence trade flows. Although
the current account deficit as a percentage of gross national
product (GNP) of the United States remained at about 3.4
per cent in 1987, the current account surplus as a percentage of GNP of Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany
decreased. Also, the United States’ fiscal deficit shrank In 1987
because of slower growth in defense spending and increased
revenue arising primarily from the 1986 Tax Reform Act. On
the other hand, the fiscal deficit widened in Japan and the
Federal Republic of Germany.

The developing countries also adopted adjustment
measures in 1987. In an attempt to overcome the adverse
impact of their unfavorable terms of trade during the preceding
years when primary commodity prices fell sharply, many
developing countries allowed their currencies to depreciate
in real terms. Some were able to take advantage of this competitive edge by exporting an increased volume of manutactured goods. Also, because of reduced foreign exchange earnings, many developing countries — especially oil-exporting
countries —— curtailed imports. While this had a favorable effect on their external balance, it generally contributed to lower
economic growth rates in these countries. New foreign borrowings by developing countries were limited, as the focus
was on reducing existing debt through repayments.

The aggregate GNP growth rate in the industrialized countries increased ty 2.9 per cent in 1987 from 2.7 per cent In
1986. This improved performance. can be attributed to higher
GNP growth in Japan. In many other industrialized countries,
the growth rate fell in 1987 due to lower growth in their investment and consumer expenditures, cautious fiscal and
monetary policies and continuing excess capacity in several
industries.

Unemployment rates, which fell slightly to 7.7 per cent in
1987 from 7.9 per cent in 1986, remained a major problem
in the industrialized countries. In Japan, the rising value of
the yen affected export-oriented industries, causing some to
reduce production, and the unemployment rate reached a
record 3 per cent. The industrial countries’ aggregate inflation rate increased moderately to 3 per cent in 1987 from
2.3 per cent in 1986. This was partly due to the effect of the
lower value of the dollar on US import prices and the partial
recovery of oil prices.

The combined current account deficit of the industrialized
caumitries increased sharply to $39 billion in 1987 from $18

billion in 1986. This can be attributed to declining import
demand in the oil-experting countries where import volumes
contracted by 15.3 per cent. It also reflects the compeiitiveness
of manufactured goods of several NICs in export markets.

{n the developing countries, the gains from the difficult
adjustment measures undertaken in earlier years were not
enough to accelerate economlc growth. The continuing debt
service problems and weak world demand for many primary
commodities affected investment and growth fn many
developing countries. Therefore, the growth rate of their
aggregate real gross domestic product (GDP} fell to 3.1 per
cent in 1987 from 4.1 per cent in 1986

In oif-exporting countries, real output declined by 0.6 per
cent as restraints were placed on oil production in order to
stabilize prices and adjusiment policies constrained domestic
demand. On the other hand, the partial recovery of oil prices
led to a sharp improvement in their combined trade and
current account balances.

For the non-oil developing countries, the average GDP
growth rate declined to 4.1 per cent in 1987 from 4.9 per
cent in 1986, Buoyancy In the manufactured exports of the
non-oil developing countries, a result of competitive gain due
to the depreciation of their currencies, helped reduce their
combined current account deficil to $9.2 billion in 1987 from
$14.3 billion in 1986,

The total outstanding external debt of the developing world,
which exceeded the one irillion dollar mark by the end of
1986, increased further in 1987. Debt service payments ofthe developing countries increased partly due to the appreciation of several major currencies, boosting the amount of debt
service payments in US dollar terms, Fortunately, however,
the debt service ratio of many developing countries declined
because of higher exports of their goods and services. During
the year, a number of countries were involved in negotiations
with the Paris Club or private creditors for rescheduling of their
debt, which helped lower their immediate debt service burden,

Overview of Developing Countries in Asia
and the Pacific!

Despite slow economic growth in the industrialized countries, the combined GDP of developing countries in the Asian
and Pacific region which are members of the Bank (DMCs}
rose by a healthy 6.8 per cent, slightly higher than their growth
rate In 1986.2 This performance compares favorably with the
aggregate growth rate of 3.1 per cent for the entire developing world (see Table 1}. Further, inflation tates in DMCs continued to be much lower than the average for all developing
countries. While the overall inflation rates of developing countries as a whole Increased significantly to 36 per cent in 1987
from 29 per cent in 1986 mainly due to the accelerating inflation rates in Latin American countries, the aggregate inflation rates in DMCs remained at single-digit levels,

While the current account balance of the developing world
Improved substantially in 1987, the aggregate current account
remained in deficit. On the other hand, the DMCs as a whole
showed a surplus in their current account for the second consectitive year,

1 For detailed statistics, see Feonomie Dalia of DMCs {ables 1-10) in
Statistical Annex af this report.

2 Atthe time of writing, GDP estimates for 1987 are available for only 19
DMCs. Tt should be noted, however, that they account far more than 99
per cent of the conwdineci GOP of all DMCs,

The excellent performance of DMCs in thetr balance of
payments is largely attributable to the rapid increase in their
exports, The aggregate value of their exports increased by 28
per cent in 1987 compared with 10.1 per cent in 1986, The
exchange vate realignments and the [)MCs' successful efforts
at diversifying exports provided the major stimuli to thelr
exports.

Three different patterns characterized the movements of the
US dollar exchange rate in DMCs, Many DMCs including
Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Taipei,China
allowed their currencies to appreciate against the US dollar,

while the exchange rates of People’s Republic of China, Hong .

Kong, Nepal and Pakistan showed little change as they largely
Jinked their currencies to the US dollar. In contrast, the currencies of a few DMCs, including Fiji and Sri Lanka,
depreciated significantly against the US dollar. Despite these
diverse patterns, the effective exchange rates of DMCs generally depreciated as the currencies of DMCs depreciated against
other major currencies.

The external debt situation in the DMCs was relatively comfortable compared with that in other developing countries. The
ratio of external debt outstanding to GDP of DMCs in 1987
was about 90) per cent, considerably lower than 164 per cent
for the entire developing world, Similarly, the debt service ratia
of DMCs in 1987 was 12 per cent compared with 23 per cent
for all developing countries,

In 1987, some DMCs were able to repay a part of their external debt ahead of schedule. In particular, the Republic of
Korea reduced its external debt substantially, and Malaysia
repaid a part of its debt in order to reduce its future debt
servicing burden and to provide a healthier debt profile.

Although the economic performance of DMCs as a whole
was satisfactory, the situation varied widely across country
groups. The NICs except Singapore maintained double-digit
growth rates for the second consecutive year, while the
Southeast Asian countries showed considerable recovery
during the year, partly because of the rise in commodity prices

of the People’s Republic of China also increased, mainly due
to booming investments and exports.

The South Asian counties, on the other hand, experienced
a difficult year. Due to the worst drought in decades in. India
anct Sri Lanka, poor rainfall in some other countries and floods
in Bangladesh, growth rates in the South Asian countries were
generally lower in 1987 than in 1986. The aggregate GDP
growth rate of South Pacific DMCs was also lower, mainly
due to the adverse effects of cyclones and political
developments.

The performance of the agriculture sector was not satisfactory in many DMCs due to unfavorable weather, Sizable crop
losses occurred in India, Lao PDR, Philippines, Thailand and
Viet Nam. Further, the unfavorable cammodity prices of
recent years also tended to dampen agricultural production
On the other hand, the manufacturing sectors of most DMCs
generally performed well. Manufactured exports increased and
domestic demand remained strong.

Inflation rates were low in the NICs while they were rela
tively high in the South Asian countries. Inflation rates in the
latter group of countries were affected adversely by
unfavorable weather. The aggregate trade balance of the
DMCs improved in 1987 as their imports increased less rapidly
than exports. The improvement was most pronounced In the
NICs and the People’s Republic of China, while the trade
balance of South Pacific DMCs slightly deteriorated.

to $13.1 billion in 1986 from $11.9 billion In 1985. There
were significant variations in flows to different countries. Total
net flows increased in the South Asian countries and the
People's Republic of China, while they decreased In the other
county groups. In particular, the NICs showed negative total
net flows as they repaid existing debt and refrained from new
borrowing, The NICs increasingly became net foreign investors
as their current accounts continued to improve in 1987. While
non-concessional flows continued to decrease, concessional
flows increased substantially to $10 billion in 1986 from $7.9
bilion in 1985. All the country groups, except the. NICs,
experienced an increase in their concessional flows, the highest
increase being reylstered by the South Asian countres. On
the other hand, non-cancessional flows increased only in the
South Asian countries and the People's Republic of China.
The following paragraphs discuss the economic
developments by five country groups: newly Industrializing
countries, Southeast Asian countries, South Asian countries,
the People’s Republic of China and South Pacific DMCs,

Newly Industrializing Countries
Impressive GDP Growth

Among the NICs, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea and
Taipei,China registered double-digit growth rates for the second consecutive year (seeTable 2). Their growth rates for 1987
were 13.6 per cent, 11.2 per cent and 11.2 per cent, respectively. Singapore's GDP growth was somewhat slower at
8.8 pet cent, but still more than four times its growth rate in
1986. Partly because of currency revaluation, the per capita
GNP of the NICs increased sharply, the most rapld increase
being registered by Taipei,China, where it rose to aboul
$5,000 in L987 compared with $3,750 in 1986, while that
of the Republic of Korea increased to $2,800 frorn $2,370.
The per capita GNP of Hong Kong and Singapore at well over
$7,000in 1987 exceeded that of several developed countries.

The manufacturing sector in the NICs continued to expand
appreciably, mainly due to surging exports and higher investment. The aggregate growth rate of the manufacturing sector of the NICs was about 16 per cent, exceeding their
aggregate GDP growth rate of 11.4 per cent.

The NICs’ aggregate inflation rate was relatively low coinpared with Ubat of olher country aroups, but it increased duuving
the year due ta strong growth in domestic demand and higher
irnport prices. The average inflation rate of the NICs rose to
2.7 per cent in 1987 from 1,6 per cent in 1986. Among the
NICs, Hong Kong bad the highest inflation rate (5,5 per cent),
followed by the Republic of Korea (3.6 per cent). Both
Singapore and Taipei, China reyistered inflation rates of less
than 1 per cent

Changing Pattern of Balance of Payments

The realignment in the value of major currencies proved
to be advantageous to the NICs. The appreciation of the yen
and major European currencies against the US dollar helpedTable 2: Real GDP Growth and Trade Balance of Newly Industrializing Countries

investor for the last three years. Net foreign capital inflows
into the NICs continued to be negative in 1987 partly due
to the drastic reduction in new borrowings and early repayment of existing debt in the Republic of Korea. However, sp oe

Domestic Policies se

During the year, the NICs continued to restructure their industries to maintain their competitive edge in the world market,Taipei,China made efforts to develop products with higher
value-added. Fur this purpose, a number of companies in
Taipei, China increased their capital investment and research
and development expenditures. Some companies moved their
manufacturing processes to lower-cost Asian locations. The
main elements of the Industrial policy in the Republic of Korea
were development of small-scale and medium-scale industries,
particularly those which are technology-intensive or In which
the country enjoys a comparative advantage, such as the
manufacture of parts and components. ‘The Korean Government also decided to reduce its tole in industrial management,
and announced that it would gradually reduce its ownership
in anumber of government-held companies. Hong Kong experienced a serious labor shortage and some companies
moved labor-intensive manufacturing processes to the People’s Republic of China.

The domestic policies of the NICs were influenced by
developments in their external sectors, A rapid increase in
money supply stemming from a growing current account
surplus caused some difficulty in the management of monetary
policies, particularly for the Republic of Korea and
Taipel,China. Monetary policy in these two countries emphasized the mopping up of excess liquidity from the foreign
sector. In this regard, the Republic of Korea relied on various
monetary policy instruments, including the issuance of
monetary stabilization bonds, while Taipet,China increased
its issue of treasury bills to help curb the growth of money
supply.

Several changes in external pollcy followed the rapid increase in the trade account surphis of the NICs. The Republic
of Korea, Singapore and Taipei, China allowed appreciation
of their domestic currencies against the US dollar; the New
Taiwan dollar by 20 per cent and the Singapore dollar and
Korean won by about 8 per cent.

Trade liberalization efforts continued in the NICs, The
Republic of Korea and Taipel,China cut tariffs on a number
of products to help reduce their trade surpluses, The Kepublic
of Korea also increased the number of ttems that could be
imported without government approval. Restrictions on capital
outilow were moderated in the Republic of Korea and
Taipei,China. Taipei, China lifted restrictions on capital outflow
by allowing individuals and companies to convert freely local
currency into foreign currency up to an equivalent of $5 million
a year for investment abroad. The Republic of Korea relaxed
its foreign exchange controls relating to overseas investment
by domestic firms.

Southeast Asian Countries
Road to Recovery

The Southeast Aslan countries experienced a mild recovery
in 1987, Thailand exhibited the best performance, its annual
GDP growth rate increasing to 6.6 per cent in 1987 from
3.4 per cent in 1986 (see Table 3). The main factors for the
more rapid economic growth in Thailand were its rapidly
expanding exports and the recovery of domestic demand.
Thailand’s sustained efforts at diversification of production and
exports seem to have paid off in enhanced economic growth
and increased exports. The Philippines, which suffered a
severe setback in recent years, registered a GDP growth rate
of 4.6 per cent in 1987 despite the sluggish performance in
the agriculture sector caused by unfavorable weather. ‘This
recovery was helped mainly by an increase in domestic demand, which was boosted by the Government's pump-prirning
program of investment In infrastructure, The recovery was alsa
helped by the successful efforts at deregulation of some industries and the rescheduling of external debt.

Oil-exporting Indonesia and Malaysia, which were hardest
hit by low oil prices in 1986, also showed recovery, The annual
GDP growth rate in Indonesia increased to 3.5 per cent in
1987 from 3.2 per cent in 1986, and that of Malaysia rose
to 4.7 per cent from 1.2 per cent. Economic recovery in these
two countries was largely led by increased exports of manulactures and the rise in the price of oil and other primary product exporis,

Agricultural production in the Southeast Asian countiles
slackened due to poor rainfall. However, the manufacturing
sector did well due to the rise in both domestic demand and
exports. The aggregate value-added Jn the manufacturing sector in the Southeast Aslan countries rose by 7.7 per cent in
1987 compared with 5.1 per cent in 1986. Export-orlented
industries performed well in all the Southeast Asian countries.

Among the Southeast Asian countries, Malaysia and
Thailand continued to have relatively low inflation rates of
1.1 per cent and 2.6 per cent, respectively. The Inflation rateTable 3: Real GDP Growth and Trade Balance of Southeast Asian Countries

b  Welghts are proportional ta GDP in US dollars In 1986,
¢ Exports are in fob prices and imports are in cif prices,

in Indonesia increased to 9.3 per cent from 8.2 per cent in
1986. However, this is still commendable considering the sharp
devaluation of the rupigh in September 1986. The tight fiscal
and monetary policies adopted by Indonesia helped minimize
the inflationary impact of the devaluation. In the Philippines,
the inflation rate increased to 6.8 per cent in 1987 from 5.3
per cent in 1986

Encouraging Non-traditional Exports

All the Southeast Asian countries enjoyed a substantial increase in merchandise exports, reflecting some success in
diversifying exports to non-traditional manufactured goods and
the recovery in commodity prices, The most tanid increase
was registered by Thailand, with a growth rate of 30.8 per
cent. Malaysia's exports also increased rapidly by 29.6 per
cent compared with a decline of 9.6 per cent In 1986. This
was largely due to favorable changes in commodity prices and
strong growth in non-traditional manufactured exports.
Indonesia's exports increased by 13.3 per cent, mainly due
to its improved competitive position resulting from the
September 1986 devaluation of the rupiah and the positive
impact of trade and industry policy reforms aimed at inereas
- ing efficiency and stimulating non-oil exports. The growth rate
of merchandise exports in the Philippines was 7.3 per cent
compared with 4.6 per cent in 1986.

Imports into the Southeast Asian countries increased by
23.4 per cent in 1987, Imports rose rapidly by 42 per cent
11 Thailand, mainly due to an increase in the amount of im
ported raw materials and intermediate goods required for a
growing output of manufactured goods. Imports into other
Southeasl Asian countries also increased, reflecting the rise
in the price of imports and replenishment of stocks of capital
and intermediate goods required in the process of economic
recovery,

The trade deficit widened in the Philippines and Thailand
sincé thelr imports increased faster than their exports.
However, the trade account iniproved in Indonesia and
Malaysia, reflecting an increase in non-oil exports and higher
oil prices. Indonesia's trade surphis remained high at $4.4
billion, while that of Malaysia increased significantly to $5.2
billion from $3 billion In 1986. Malaysia had a surplus in its
current account for the first ttme since 1980.

The external debt position of Indonesia and the Philippines
remained troublesome. At the end of 1986, total external debt
outstanding! in Indonesia had grown to $42.1 billion from
$35.8 billion in 1985, and that of the Philippines had increased
to $28.2 billion from $26.2 billion in 1985. Among the
Southeast Asian countries, the debt service ratio in regard to
public and publicly guaranteed long-term debt increased most
tapidly in Indonesia during 1986, registering 29.3 per cent
compared with 19.9 per cent in 1985.

rowing, including import-related credits. Its external debt service obligation has bean adversely affected by recent international currency realignments, as about 60 per cent of ils external debt is denominated in currencies other than the US
dollar

The Philippines, the only DMC which resorted to external
debt rescheduling in recenl years, reached an agreement with
foreign coramercial banks for a second rescheduling arrangement for its external debt. For converting the country's foreign
debt hiability into equity, the Philippines appraved a
debt/equity swap program during the year, More than 130
debt-to-equity conversions totalling $456 million were already
approved in 1987, Debt/equity swaps lolalling $557 million
were pending Government clecision at the end of 1987
Debt/equity swap operations in the Philippines were closely

linked to privatization efforts, since the Government strongly
encouraged investors to purchase state-controlled assets.
Malaysia’s external debt declined in 1987, largely due to
government policies of borrowing less from abroad, and
government efforts towards prepayment of external loans.
About $1 billion in external loans was prepaid in 1987. In
addition, the Government also undertook measures to restructure its debt in order to limit its exposure to any particular
cutrency and to reduce the overall debt-servicing costs.

Domestic Polictes

indonesia and Malaysia continued to face resource con
straints and therefore pursued tight fiscal policies. Indonesia
continued its austere budget for purposes of demand manage-ment. Given its worsening resource constraint, Malaysia
drastically cut its development expenditure. The Philippines,
however, expanded fiscal expenditures te help boost its saqging economy, Thailand continued a generally restrictive fiscal
stauce. Governinent efforts to cut the budget deficit were
assisted by increased revenues resulting from its improved
economic performance.

Efforts at fiscal reform continued in the Southeast Asian
countries. In Indonesia, considerable progress was made in
implementing its income tax and value-added tax reforms.
Emphasis was placed on improving efficiency in tax collection. Various tax reforms are being introduced in the
Philippines in order to allow the country to move away from
dependence on foreign trade-related taxes and towards
domestic-based taxes. Both Malaysia and Thailand continued
to implement revenue-raising measures.

Monetary policy in the Southeast Asian countries varied
widely. Indonesia resorted to tight monetary control to prevent capital flight and reduce inflationary pressure. [ts central
bank raised base interest rates on Bank Indonesia certificates
and took measures to reduce the banking sector's liguidlity.
In particular, four state enterprises were required to purchase
Bank Indonesia certificates and withdraw funds from state
commercial banks. This led to a significant reduction in
liquidity. Monetary policy in the Philippines focused on encouraging private investment The Government approved a
reduction In the reserve requirement ratio for deposits with
commercial banks. Malaysia also eased the liquidity
requirements of commercial banks with a view to stimulating
the economy. Thailand eased its monetary policy to support
the economic recovery,

The Southeast Asian counttigs made various efforts to encourage the role of the market mechanism and to promote
further industrialization, Indonesia initiated reforms aimed at
improving the investment environment and at promoting nonoil exports. As a first step in the rationalization of its structure
of protection, some non-tariff barriers were replaced by tarilfs
and import-licensing restrictions were reduced. Indonesia also
continued its policy of liberalization and deregulation of trade
and investment, Import restrictions were relaxed and import
tariffs were abolished or lowered in a number of items. In addition, manufacturers were allowed to diversify product lines
without lengthy approval procedures. Investment and licensing regulations were also further streamlined.

Malaysia introduced various deregulatory measures in an
effort to improve its overall investment climate. The Industrial
Coordination Act was revised to relax its private investment
licensing procedures and requirements, Various tax incentives
were realigned, and the New Investment Fund was initiated
to assist private sector investment In priority industries.
Application procedures for customs duty exemptions were
simplified and approvals of applications were expedited.
Malaysia also began to formulate a meclium-term to long-term
industria) development slrategy aimed at promoting higher
value-added In its exparts, restructuring the industrial sector,
and promoting stronger intet-sectoral linkages.

The Philippines proceeded with a far-reaching trade
liberalization program which began in 1981, but was held In
abeyance between 1983 and 1986, and was resurned oily

 

by the present Government in mid-1986. ‘The program
focuses on liberalizing tariff and quota restrictions and inchides
a phased lariff and quota reduction over the next five years.
There were no major changes in trade policies in Thailand,

Privatization efforts continued in the Southeast Asian counties. Malaysia adopted various measures aimed al promoting
the private sector, including some allowing the private sector
to enter into activities traditionally run by the Government.
The Philippines also embarked on a program of privatization
under which many enterprises are to be soid to the private
sector. Charged with the disposition of government assets,
the Assets Privatization Trust announced during 1987 the sala
of 58 corporations. Privatization efforts are under way in
Thailand. The Government sougtit private sector involvement

to play a leading role in its large-scale reforestation program.

During the year, Southeast Asian countries attempted to
attract more foreign direct investment. Indonesia relaxed its
rules on foreign investments. For example, foreign investors
are given 15 years instead of 10 years to transfer 51 per cent
of a joint venture to domestic shareholders. Malaysia relaxed
its rules on forelgn equity participation in order to promate
foreign direct investment, particularly in export-orlented and
high-risk industries, and for foreign companies establishing
operations in Malaysia before the end of 1990, The Philippines announced a new Investment code for foreign and
domestic investment which included a package of tax and
import duty relief, Thailand tack some positive steps towards
improving the investment environment, including expansion
in privileges granted to rural investments to diversify manufacturing plants fo mral areas and the collection of a surcharge
on certain import products to promote local industry. Partly
due to the improved investment environment which reflects

the above favorable policy changes and partly due to’ the
appreciation of non-US dollar major currencies which made
investments in developing countries cheaper in terms of
investors’ currencies, foreign direct investment in Southeast
Asian countries increased substantially in 1987.

Southeast Asian counties introduced several policy changes
in agriculture. In the Phitippines, the agriculture sector has
been the subject of considerable deregulation since mid-1985.
Major changes occurred in the structure of the regulatory
authorities relating to the sugar and coconut industries and
alse in the functions of authorities in charge of the importation and distribution of fertilizers, pesticides, wheat and flour.
During 1987, the major issue in the agriculture sector in the
Philippines was the Land Reform Program, though details
have yet to be finalized by Congress.

Indonesia introduced a new “intensification” program
designed to offset the anticipated production losses in the areas
most seriously affected by drought. Also, a new polley statement regarding Imlgation envisages that, over a 15-year
period, efficient operation and maintenance of hrigation
systems will be Intraduced throughout the country which will
allow operating and maintenance costs to be recovered directly
through trrigation service fees.

There was some progress in the regional cooperation efforts
af Southeast Asian countries. The heads of governments of
the Associalion of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) held
thelr third summit, the first in ten years, in Manila in
December.’ The leaders endorsed long-discussed measures
for promoting economic cooperation. The four agreements
signed during the summit aim at improving ASEAN’s existing
preferential trading arrangements, freezing and gradually
reducing the non-tariff barriers facing intra-ASEAN trade,
revising the existing ASEAN industrial joint venture
agreernent and promoting and protecling intraASEAN
investment,

During the summit, the Japanese prime minister announced
a $2 billion ASEAN-Japan Development Fund (AJDF) which
is to be distributed among the six member countries. The AJDF
is to focus on the development of the private seclor in the
ASEAN countries.

South Asian Countries
Adverse Effects of Weather on Growth

GDP growth in the South Asian countries slackened
significantly in 1987 (see Table 4}. Agricultural production in
these counties was adversely affected by droughts and flvods,
Because of the worst drought in 40 years, India’s GDP growth
rate fell to 1.5 per cent er about one-third of that in 1986.
The growth rates of Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal and Sr Lanka
were also lower in 1987 than in 1986, mainly due to
unfavorable weather. Among the South Asian countries,
Pakistan showed the highest GDP growth rale of 7.7 per cent,
a slightly higher rate than that in 1986.

1 Members of ASEAN are Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Phillppines,
Singapore and Thailand.The inflation rate in the South Asian countries remained
selatively high in 1987, Led by higher {vod prices and shortages of basic consumer goods, the inflation rate in Burma rose
to 19 per cent in 1987 from 8 per cent in 1986. In India, the
drought conditions contributed to the increase in prices. In
Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the inflation rates were
lower in 1987 than in 1986, Pakistan had the lowest inflation
rate among the South Asian countries for the second
consecutive year, mainly due to increased import liberalization and ils effective monetary polley.

Improving the Trade Balance

Exports of South Aslan countries showed an impressive
increase of 21.9 per cent in 1987 compared with 11.1 per
cent in 1986. Among the South Asian countries, the most
rapid increase was registered by Bangladesh (26.4 per cent),
followed by India (24.7 per cent) and Pakistan (20 per cent).
Increases in manufactured exports and higher primary com
modity prices contributed to the excellent export performance
in these countries. Exports of Sri Lanka also increased
moderately despite the sharp fall in tea prices in 1987, Trade
balances of mast South Asian countries improved as their
exports increased faster than thelr Imports. Only in the case
of Nepal, the trade balance deteriorated due to the slower
growth in its exports.

Damestic Policies

South Asian countries continued to experience large budget
deficits. Most of them, therefore. tried to imprave their fiscal
performance. Bangladesh introduced new yrevenue-raising
measures and reduced subsidies on foodgrains, India levied
surcharges on some taxes and rail and air fares lo meet
the higher expendilure required for drought relief and continued to simplify and rationalize tts tax structure and to improve tax administration. It recently undertook a number of
measures aimed al strengthening control over expenditure.

inchiding the introduction of zero-base budgeting for all
government departments. Nepal also introduced reforms
aimed at improving collection efficiency in regard to tax and
other revenues,

In Pakistan, the National Taxation Commission made broad
recommendations in March for rationalizing the tax system.
In Sri Lanka, the main focus of fiscal policy was on preparing
fer economic reconstruction after a four-year civil war.

During 1987, some important changes also occurred in the
monetary policy of South Asian countries. India took measures
to regulate its pace of monetary expansion in such a manner
that it did not-go out of alignment with output trends. Sri
Lanka, however, undertook a gradual relaxation of the
slringent monetary policy followed since 1984 with a view to
stimulating economic activity. Burma resorted to demonetization of its three largest currency denozninations, the 25-Kyat,
35-Kyai and 75-Kyat notes.

South Asian countries attempted to adjust their trade policies
to improve their trade environment. India views the external
sector as an important element in its drive fo increase economic
efficiency, particularly in industry. Government recognition
of the need to devise efficient mechanisms for exports has
led to a number of policy changes. During the year, India
adopted a set of incenlives for improving duly drawbacks on
a wide range of iteras. [t also tried to expand its counter-trade
with countries with which it runs a deficit, notably those in
the Middle East from which it buys oil. Nepal introduced an
auction system for allocating import licenses for non-essentials

Pakistan introduced a new trade policy which provides new
incentives for exporters and liberalizes imports. Major changes
provided in the new export policy include partial income tax
exemption in regard to the income received from manufactured exports, a drawback on surcharges and fees on imported
inputs for exports and an increase in financial support for
export industries. To enlarge the role o!f the market
mechanism, Burma announced that any citizen can engage
in any private enterprise Upon registration.

India set out a new medium-term industrial strategy which
is focused on initiating longer-term structural change in the
industrial sector and the overall economy. A number of important changes in the domestic regulatory environment have
been made since the start of the Seventh Plan (FY 1985/86
to FY 1989/90) aimed at increasing competition and allowing the private sector greater freedom to enter new markets,
upgrade technology and expand output.

Pakistan has followed a policy of progressive liberalization
since the annecuncement of the Industrial Policy Statement
in 1984, During the year, Pakistan further deregulated
industrial sanctioning procedures. It also achieved a substantial reduction in public sector involvement in manufacturing
activity and an increase in private sector Incentives which led
to a notable Improvement in output growth.

Sri Lanka adopted an Industrial policy with requlations and
incentives in the areas of tariff reform, exchange rate policy,
restructuring of public enterprises and export promotion.
Aspects of the policy are now being Jmplemented.

South Asian countries continue to attach high priority to
the agriculture sector, The Government made an important
change in Burma; in an attempt to relieve food shortages,
it fled all restrictions on private sector involvement in buying,
selling, storing and transporting nine food staples, including
tice and corn. ,

In fidia, the focus of agricultural policy was on minimizing
the adverse impact of droughts. The drought conditions of
1987 disrupted agricultural operations on a massive scale in
all states and led to a substantial loss of Income and employment, particularly among small farmers and agricultural
laborers. To deal with these problems, India formed a Cabinet
Committee on Drought which formulated a comprehensive
Action Plan.

In Pakistan, the raising of agricultural procurement prices
towards market prices led to Increased sown acreage and
output. Pakistan also introduced voluntary procurement to
replace monopoly procurement and lifted the ban on interdistrict movement of rlce.

To promote regional cooperation in South Asia, the heads
of the seven countries of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) held their third annual summit in Kalhmandu, Nepal, in November. The leaders agreed
to create a regional reserve of food stocks which obliges
member countries to maintain jointly food grain stocks totalling 200,000 tons, This food stock is to supplement national
stocks and will be supplied to needy member states in
emergencies. It was also agreed that two studies would be
commissioned to promote further cooperation — collective
action in the management of floods and droughts and joint
funding of projects by member states.People’s Republic of China
Sustained Economic Growth

Economic reforms are fuelling economic growth in the
People’s Republic of China. The economle growth rate rose
to 9.3 per cent in 1987 from 7.9 per cent in 1986 (see Table
4).) Agricultural production increased by 4.7 per cent, while
the gross product of rural saciety and the industial outpul
value rose by 12.7 per cent and 16.5 per cent, respectively.
Efforts were made to rationalize the investment structure and
consumption pallerns. The rate of inflation was 7.2 per cent

in 1987, compared with 6 per cent in 1986 and 8.8 per cent .

in 1985,

The trade deficit narrowed to $3.7 billion in 1987 from $12
billion in 1986. The current account deficit also decreased
significantly. These improvements are attributable to rising
exports and tighter controls over imports, which declined by
11.9 per cent during the year. Along-with improvement in
the balance of payments. international reserves increased to
$16.8 billion at year-end from $12 billion at the end of 1986.

The total external debt of the People’s Republic of China
reached $22.7 billion by the end of 1986, and in 1987, the
country continued to borrow to finance iis new investment
and the madeinization of existing projects.

Domestic Policies

Although a series of economic reforms undertaken since
1978 contributed significantly to a movement away from
central planning and towards a system which Integrates planning with the market, the market mechanism remains
imperfect. Reforms allowing mare local authority over
investments have had many positive effects including an
Increase in production and investments, but instances of
investrnents In low-pricrity sectors have been reported.

Industrial sector reforms were initiated on a pilot scale in
selected cities in 1979 aad formally introduced nationwide in
1984. These reforms were aimed at stimulating productivity
and efficiency by defining the relations between the state and
enterprises and between lhe owners and managers of enterprises with regard to their respective responsibilities, powers
and interests. In 1987, enterprise management under ihe
above contracting system between the State and Individual
enterprises has made remarkable progress.

Under financial reforms begun in 1979, the monobankiny
system has been lransformed into a diversified structure. The
number of institutions and financial services has increased and
the regulatory role of the Central Iank has been strengthened.
Fraphasis has been made in mobilizing deposits through banks
and competition has been encouraged in the financial system
in relation to deposit mobilization, foreign exchange business
and lending operations.

significant results, The Central Bank raised the reserve requirement ratio that applies on bank deposits and introduced con
trols over credits of specialized banks, resulting in an effective
control of credit expansion,

Government subsidies and government-set prices have kepl
the prices of many products artificially low, and this has
discouraged production and created shortages. To remedy
this situation, price reforms were introduced on a limited scale,
but there are indications that the concern over inflationary
pressures may delay further reforms.

To reduce ils trade deficit, the People’s Republic of China
has adopted a policy of prumoting exports and squeezing inports. Exporting firms have been given inore autonomy and
incentives. Companies are allowed to retain part of their
foreign currency earnings, the export-licensing system has
been simplified and administrative interference has been
reduced.

The Government has tightened approvals for foreign commercial loans and the issuance of bunds overseas. Regulations have been formulated concerning the use and repayment of foreign loans, These regulations are designed to
facilitate collection of Information about the country’s external debt as a means of controlling the size of external borrowing, to see that Lhe loans are used properly and efficiently, and to ensure that borrowers will repay both principal and
interest according to the loan agreements. Foreign direct investment, however, continues to be encouraged as a means.
of gaining access ta technology and management skills.

23South Pacific DMCs
Effects of Cyclones

The economic performance of the South Pacific DMCs
(SPDMCs) was not encouraging. Some countries Including
Cook Islands and Vanuatu were hard hit by cyclones which
damaged farm crops and vatlous infrastructural facilities.
Furlher, political developments in Fiji had a severe impact on
tourist arrivals, production and investment. Fiji's GDP declined
sharply during the year (see Table 5}, Solomon Islands
recovered from the negative growth in the previous two years,
but its growth rate in 1987 was only 1 per cent. Western
Samoa also experienced a low GDP growth rate of 1.2 per
cent, while Tonga showed a growth rate close to zero mainly
due to a decline in the production of tree crops and unfavorable trends in the export prices of its major commodities.
The GDP growth rate of Papua New Guinea (PNG) was 2.9
per cent in 1987, which is lower than that in 1986.

Inflation rates remained low tn the SPDMCs mainly because
of a moderate increase in import prices and weak domestic

demand. However, the performance of Individual countries
varied, While inflation rates fell is Cook Islands, PNG, Tonga
and Western Samoa, they rose substantially in Vanuatu and
Fiji. Higher inflation in Vanuatu was partly attributable to large
increases in tariffs and shortages of basic foods caused by
cyclones, and that in Fiji to currency devaluation. Intlation
rates remained high in Solomon Islands.

The balance-of-payments position of the SPDMCs
worsened in 1987. The aggregate trade account deficit
increased due to larger increases Jn imports than {n exports.
Aggregate exports increased by 2.4 per cent, while aggregate
imports rose by 11.6 per cent. As a result, the external debt
situation was aggravated in some SPDMCs, particularly in
PNG, Solomon Islands and Western Samoa.

Domestic Policies

Domestic policies varied among the SPDMCs, In Fiji, in
view of the deteriorating economic situation which followed
political developments, the emphasis of economic policy was
on promoting investment and stimulating economic activity.
Consequenily, the Government announced a package af proposals which included duty-free entry af plant, equipment and

PNG continued to encourage import substitution and
export-oriented industries in which the country has comparative advantage and thase with a large value-added com:
ponent. Te encourage foreign Investment in this area, priority
was giveri to creating a conducive investment climate.
Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Western Samoa also made
efforts towards creating a stable econamic environment, while
at the same time accelerating the structural transformation of
their ecanomies.

Although some SFDMCs experienced increasing budget
deficits during the year, efforts were made to improve this
situation, PNG's fiscal policy remained focused on constraining
expenditure to levels that are sustainable in the light of the
country’s medium-term balance-of-payments outlook, Major
policies were introduced which aimed at increasing the effectiveness of expenditures by redirecting resources to productive areas, especially in the economic and infrastructure sectors and away from ihe security and administrative sectors.
A growing budget deficit was the main concern of Fiji,
Selomon Islands and Vanuatu, where steps were taken ta
minimize deficits, reduce recurrent expenditure and improve
lax collection, Tax policy in Western Samoa focused on
reducing and equitably distributing the overall tax burden and
creating incentives for development.

PNG approved a general privatization policy under which
four companies were designated to be'sold. PNG also decided to sell most of the ministerial houses occupied by public
servants to save Ihe maintenance cost of government housing.
Western Samoa took steps to sell its minority shareholdings
in selected private companies and initiated negotiations for
the privatization of several corporations, such as the Special
Projects Development Carparation, and such activities as Ibe
liquor operations of the Customs Department.

The currencies of the SPDMCs generally depreciated against
major currencies other than the US dollar. Against the US
dollar, Fiji devalued Its currency twiee to stimulate exports and
discourage imports and capital flight and the currency of
Salomon Islands also depreciated. The currencies of PNG,
Vanuatu and Western Samoa appreciated against the US
dollar.

Efforts at reglonal cooperation among the SPDMCs focused
on the 18th South Pacific Forum held in Apia, Western
Samoa, in May. The Forum countries called upon dapan to
provide more aid and to conclude a fisheries agreement with
the region, They also agreed to examine ways of rescuing the
flagging copra industry and to intensify econamic coaperation amoag member nations.

OUTLOOK

Most forecasts regarding the world economy in. 1988
indicate that the growth of world output and trade will be slow.
This suggests that the external envionment will continue to
be difficult for developing countries.

The NICs achieved remarkable growth In 1987, primarily
on the strength of exports, but it may be difficult to sustain
such high growth rates of GDP and exports during 1988.
Pressures on NICs to revalue currencies and open up domestic
markets are likely to cause a reduction in growth of exports
and current account surpluses.

The Southeast Asian countries are expected to maintain
or even exceed their 1987 growth rates. Although oilexporting DMCs will continue to face resource constraints, efforts at economic restructuring and improved efficiency may
help increase further their production and export of manufactured goods. Economic performance in these countries will
depend partly on the prices of oil and primary commodities.
Recent successful efforts to diversify their economies should
facilitate high production and growth.

South Asian countries are generally expected to experience
higher economic growth rates in 1988 as their economies
rebound from low 1987 levels. The GDP growth rate of India
is expected to be higher due to the recovery in agricultural
production. Improved efficiency through policy reform, rapid
expansion of the industrial sector and improvement In
infrastructure should boost that recovery. Nepal's growth rate
is also expected to be higher as Its exparts show a sharp
increase and agriculture recovers from drought. However,
Bangladesh is likely to experience slower growth due to serious
floods in the latter half of 1987.

The growth rale of the People’s Republic of China is likely
to slow down as the Government tries to stem inflation through
controlling investment and consumption, Ecanamic reforms
will, however, continue through 1988. The emphasis of the
reforms is expected to be on transforming the management
system in industries.

The South Pacific DMCs are expected to experience slow
economic growth in 1988, since the prices of their primary
exports are expected to remain depressed while it will take
some years for these economies to recover from the impact
of the cyclones. ‘

The overall growth of the DMCs in 1988 is expected to
remain at about the level achieved in 1986 and 1987, The
extemal debt situation is expecled tu remain manageable while
the recovery in food praduction should reduce the pressure
on prices experienced in several countries during 1987,

TRANSPLANTING pine trees in the Hill Forest Development Project in Nepal which
the Bank is assisting with a concessional Joan of $16.7 million.ENVIRONMENTAL AND
NATURAL RESOURCES
PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT

The Challenge

ONE of the major challenges facing mankind is how to meet
basic human needs while sustaining the resource base upon
which these needs depend.

In the Asta-Pacific region, the demand for natural resources
is expected to increase dramatically over the next 15 years
because of accelerating population and economic growth and
more capital and technology-intensive production, The
region's population will increase by about 40 per cent — in
the cities by some 90 per cent — and economic activity will
double the demand on natural resources, Consequently,
without careful planning and management, the following environmental conditions may materialize:

* the loss of about 11 per cent or 80 million hectares of

" current forest cover, thereby endangering critical water
sheds and habitats and increasing soil erosion and the
frequency of flooding and drought;

* the salinization, alkalinization and waterlogging of existing and newly-irrigated land, as well as widespread Incidence of malaria, schistosomiasis and other diseases;

© the possible desertification of many marginal areas due
to increased number of livestock;

¢ the depletion or destruction of many near-shore fisheries
due to vertain fishing practices neat coral reefs, clearance
of mangroves and water pollution;

* a five te ten-fold increase in air and water pollution due
to a 300 per cent increase in motor vehicles and a
150-200 per cent intensification of industrial and mining activity; and

* increasing environmental and health problems due to
a possible doubling in the use of pesticides, as well as
their misuse.

Underlying such problems are strong political, economic
and social factors which often linit opportunities to find or
implement more beneficial methods of natural resources

 

usage. Economic pressures force many developing nations
to exploit rapidiy their natural wealth at the expense of future
needs, rates of exploitation exceed the regulatory capacities
of governmental and traditional institutions, and cultural values
and popular attitudes discourage resource management,

Jn addition, planned interventions generally lack an appreciation of the complexities and dynarnics of interactions
within and between natural and man-made systems, define
objectives In narrow, sectoral terms, use production
technologies inherently unsulted to particular condiltons, overvalue immediate productlon gains and fail to internalize the
costs of their Impacts on other economic development
activities,

Despite the enormity of these problems, there are signs of
change for the better, This Is partly due to the realization that
constraints on effective natural resources management also
hold back economic and social progress. In some areas, forests
are being replanted after felling. A few nations are taking steps
to reduce soil loss and desertification, The need for family planning is becoming better understood. Water supplies are being protected and pest management practices involying the
use of pesticides are being reappraised.

Encouraging though these developments are, they are far
from adequate and vigorous, determined initiatives are needed
if greater human suffering and environmental degradation are
to be avoided. There are, however, no. quick and easy
answers. The problems of population, natural rescurces and
environment are complex and long-term and are exacerbated
by their linkage with poverty, inequality and social conflict.

The Bank’s Response

Most governments in the Asia-Pacific region are aware that
environmental problems jeopardize development potential and
many have passed environmental legislation and established
environmental agencies, For its part, the Bank has shown jncreasing concern for the environment, recognizing that it is
rarely a question of environment versus development but

27generally one of blending the environmental dimension with
the overall objectives of socio-economic development,

Traditionally, the Bank has supported projects with important environmental benefits like reforestation, water supply
and sanitation, urban development and housing and the
preparation of regional development plans. However,
developing member country (DMC) governments are giving
greater attention to projects involving environmental and
natural resources planning with the tesult that the Bank's
assistance has been extended to new areas such as coastal
zone management, watershed protection, urban and industrial
pollution control and occupational health and safety.

In its environmental policies, the Bank, through its Environ:
ment Unit, is committed to promoting environmentaily-sound
economic development by pursuing the following: (i) instituting
procedures for systematic environmental examination of alt
the Bank’s development activities — including policies, programs and projects — to ensure the incorporation of environmental and natural resources planning and management
coricerns; (ii) cooperating with DMCs and other organizations
to ensure that appropriate environmental protection measures
are incorporated in the design and implementation of
economic development projects (in this connection, the Bank
may provide technical assistance to develop the relevant indigenous capacity of tts DMCs); (ii) supporting environmental and natural resources programs and projects; {iy) training
and \Informing Bank staff in the environmental aspects of
economic development; and (v) conducting studies leading
to the improvement of project processing and implementatlon methodologies and preparing and disseminating
documentation and other materials to provide guidance on
the environmental aspects of economic development.

A number of environmental activities have been undertaken
In pursuit of these policies:

Country Programming and Country Strategy Studies

At the beginning of each year, to assist Country Programming Missions in their discussions with DMC environmental
and natural resources agencies and to assess opportunities for
technical assistance and investment projects in environmental natural resources development, the Environrhent Unit
prepares Environmental and Natural Resources Briefing Profiles for each member country. These Profiles identify major
environmental and natural resources concerns in the DMCs,
list environmental agencies in the DMCs to be consulted and
provide examples of environmental resources development
projects for possible funding by the Bank.

Following the approval af country programs, the Bank's Environment Unit communicates with environmental agencies
and official contact points in the Bank’s DMCs notifying them
about projects which may generate significant environmental
Impacts and which require necessary temedial measures.
Follow-up discussions allow an exchange of information and
advice to be given on the handling of difficult problems.
Whenever possible, non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
dealing with environmental and natural resources activities are
also contacted and encouraged to cooperate with governments
on these projects as stipulated In the Bank’s policy on NGOs.

This is primarily with the view to soliciting their opinions and

_promoting the use of their expertise, where appropriate, as

input into the formulation and processing of development
projects,

The Bank’s County Strategy Studies, which determine the
Bank's future operational strategy over the medium term, include coverage of environmental considerations in each country and a chapter on the environmental dimensions of
economic development. However, to encourage the longerterm view of development, the Environment Unit has prepared
formal studies of the environmental and natural resources of
a number of DMCs. Each analysis attempts to identify major
environmental and natural resources constraints and opportunities likely to affect economic development and to delineate
planning and management needs, development programs and
potential projects with which to correct critical cases of loss
or degradation of environmental and natural resources.

Project Review

The Environment Unit assists the Projects Departments/Divisions tn reviewing the environmental aspects of
projects fo be financed by the Bank and engages the project
cycle in the following ways:

Project [dentification

To initiate its project review activities, the Environment Unit
aises with project managers and their staff to classify projects
stipulated in the Country Program Papers in accordance with
their likely environmental impacts. This leads to a report,
“Preliminary Environmental Screening of Loan and Technical
Assistance Projects", prepared by the Environment Unit.
Proposed Bank projects are divided into four broad impact
categories, reflecting the nature of their likely environmental
impacts and thus their need for environmental analysis:
Category A: projects rarely having significant adverse
environmental Impacts; Category B: those with significant
adverse environmental impacts but for which mitigative/
remedial measures may be prescribed readily; Category C:
those with significant adverse environmental Impacts requiring
detailed environmental assessment/analysis; and Category D:
environmentally-oriented projects.

A second report, “Secondary Environmental Screening of
Lean and Technical Assistance Projects”, is then prepared by
the Environment Unit. With more information available, major environmenta! concerns are specified and the scope of
work and work program! are established for the processing and
implementation of pipeline projects for the year,

Fact-Finding

Contributing formal and informal environmental reviews at
the project fact-finding stage Is crucial beeauise this ts the most
effective way of avoiding conception and design errors which
could prove difficult and costly to rectify later. The Environment Unit comments on project planning and design
expressed in the Project Briefs. it also establishes terms of
reference for missions and examines the Back-to-Officean integrated plan for socio-economic development with sustained environmental and natural resources management.

Reports of Fact-Finding Missions. The Environment Specialists
sometimes attend Management Review Meetings on the
Bank’s projects, especially for those falling under Categories
C and D, to review the proposed treatment of environmental
and natural resources issues,

For some projects, an Environment Specialist or a staff consultant may visit the proposed project site as part of the FactFinding Mission or independently to undertake an Initial en
vironmental examination. If a potential problem is confirmed,
more detailed studies may be required to establish mitigative
Teasures and to incorporate them in project planning and
design.

To support the environmental review function, the Environment Unit deploys especially developed “Environmental
Guidelines” to help staff during project processing to determine whether or not a propesed project is likely to generate
significant environrnental impacts and, where such impacts
are considered adverse, to specify the need for mare detailed
study,

Pre-Appraisal / Appraisal

This is the comprehensive review stage of the project cycle
at which environmental issues are merged with technical, institutlonal, economic, socio-cultural and financlal parameters
and the foundations Jaid for implementing the project and
evaluating It upon completion. ‘'o ensure an appropriate

 

igned to formulate

representation of the environmental dimension, a statement
on the significant environmental impacts of the project and
the detailing of measures to be adopted to reduce adverse
impacts Is undertaken by projects staff for projects with significant environmental impacts and included in the Appraisal
Report. The statement yerierally includes the identification and
Prediction of impacts on environmental and natural resource
conditions and the quantification, wherever possible, of both
direct and indirect impacts and their mitigation in monetary

During appralsai, environmental protection planning and
Management requirements of projects with significant environmental impacts are discussed between the Appraisal Mission and the Government. Agreements reached on appropriate environmental protection measures are incorporated
as proposed loan covenants in the Memorandum af
Understanding and incorporated as covenants in the Loan
Agreement. This is in additton to the standard provision on
environmental practices which has been Included in the Bank’s
loan documents, To assure proper and timely implementation of the environmental covenants, the additional costs of
implementing and monitoring significant environmental
protectlon measures are included in the project costs and may
either be financed under the loan or by the borrower. If
financed by the borrower, the Appraisal Mission ensures that
the financing of the additional costs of significant
environmental protection measures has an adequate budget.Negoitations

For projects with significant adverse environmental impacts
and which require detailed environmental assessment, an
Environment Specialist may form parl of the Bank's
negotiating team,

implementation and Supervision

Having incorporated environmental control measures in
project formulation, Review Missions ensure that environmen:
tal safeguards are implemented efficiently and satisfactorily
by the Borrower/Executing’ Agency during the construction
and operation of the project. For most industrial projects, problems occur during operations due to insufficient maintenance
or non use of pollution-contrel devices and facilities.

More specifically, Review Missions examine and evaluate
operation and maintenance atrangements and institutional
commitments and lnan covenants covering environmental
planning and management requirements, To help accomplish
this, projects staff consult the Environment Unit and receive
their assistance as appropriate. Further Back-to-Office Reports
of Review Missions provide explicit details on any major en
vironmental problems or issues revealed during field visits and
on proposed remedial measures with an indication of the need
for follow-up, especially for environmentally-hazardous projects which require continuous review even during their
operations.

Towards the end of the year, the Environment Unit prepares
arepor, Loan Projects Approved During 19__: Projects Hequiring Environmentah Review During implementation, This
document provides a list of projects requiring specific en
vironmental trealment during the iraplementation phase.

Completion and Post-Evaluation

After physical completion of the project, a Project Completion Report is prepared as a factual, historical record. Il
includes a general assessment of the significant environmental impacts, Including socin-cultural Impacts, generated during project implemeniaiion, particularly with reference to those
issues considered al Lhe time of project appraisal. If the project involved environmental control measures, their implementation and effectiveness is evaluated. Posi-Evaluation Reporls
or Project Performance Audit Reports include a final analysis
as to whether the project met proposed environmental requlrernents and whether any unanticipated effects were induced as a resuli of project activities.

Project Monitoring Information System

A project monitoring information system operated by the
Environment Unit keeps track of major environmental concerns associated with loan and technical assistance projects
duzing project processing and implementation. Project officers
and the Bank's Management are regularly informed of the
status of projects with respect lo their environmental impacts
and necessary control measures. This procedure is being fur
ther developed sc that projects can be monitored more closely
during implementation and after completion. In the case of
potentially hazardous and pollutive projects, such as chemical
industries, pulp and paper mills and cement plants, environmental monitoring may be required for an extended
period — in some cases, throughout the economic life of the

project,

Resource Center Activities

As efforts ta strengthen the enviranmental dimension in
development projects must be in concert with the needs of
DMCs, the Environment Unit is pursuing the following supportive strategies: (i} briefing of DMCs through Bank Missions
on how the Bank might assist government bodies establish
and/or reinforce environmental planning; {ii} presenting forral and informal seminars/training to government staff in the
Rank’s DMCs and giving advice on environmental matters;
(ii) helping promote and implement environmental or natural
resources projects or components of projects; and
{iv) strengthening liaison and cooperation with a growing
number of national and international institutions and organizations in the environmental fteld.

In pursuit of these strategies, major resource papers have
been completed including Economic Analysis of the Environmental Impacts of Development Projects and a Handbook on the Use of Pesticides in the Asia/Pacific Region. An
Environment Paper Series has also been initiated

Education and Training of Statf

Apart from the project-by-project contact and informal
discussions on environmental matters between the Environment Specialists and Bank staff, in-house seminars/workshons
have been held on environmental planning and management/economic evaluation, These presentations review the
importance of environmental and natural resources planning
and management in the Bank's development activities and
how they may be integrated with the project cycle. Training
programs have also been undertaken on a regular basis in the
Bank's DMCs for staff of environmental and related agencies.

Future Directions

Whatever the goal of development activities — satisfaction
of basic needs or a composite measure of social welfare —
it is clear that there are ecolayical lirnits to growth and to modifying natural systems. The limits vary from country to country in the Asia-Pacific region but involve soil stability, nutrient
sources and uses, preservation of genetic diversity, sustainability of yields, water use, energy efficiency and poilution.
There are also socio-economic constraints to radical interventions, particularly regarding the values, organization and
institutions of the intended beneficiaries and opportunities for
joca) participaiion.

In view of the increasing awareness of the importance of
environmental and natural resources ta economic develop
ment, attention is being focused on longer-term needs; theestablishment of natural resources usage policies, implementation and enforcement of environmental leglslation, coordination of intersectoral goals. and information management
systems. Particular attention is being directed Lowards integrated, multt-disciplinary approaches to development. Sectoral compartmentalizing of the use of natural resources often
produces conflicts and inefficient usage. Measures designed
to solve one problem often create or exacerbate problems in
another functional area. To date, the.solution to these oversights has been to implement policies and procedures designed
to ensure systematic environmental review of development
programs and projects. However, this approach needs to be
supplemented by the integration of environmental and natural
resources planning and management with the traditional
aspects of macroeconomic planning and thereby engage the
broader country economic and'sector context.

The Bank has launched a number of activities in an effort
to encourage sounder use of natural resources for what has
come to be called “sustainable development”. For example,
the project cycle is being engaged to help ensure that economic
accounting reflects the values of natural goods and services,
Currently, the costs of such activities as forest clearing, soil
loss and use of water resources are significantly understated
and the benefits of watersheds, forests, wetlands and other
natural habitats are excluded from economic calculations.
Thus, guidelines have been developed or are being developed
to include accounting and estimation of environmental and
natural resources costs and benefits at project, sector and program levels.

Another activity to be pursued by the Bank includes paying greater attention to the socio-cultural aspects of development project processing, lor example, settlement/resettlement, needs and Interests of local communities, tights of
tribal/ethnic minorities, cultural integrity and traditional land
use control. This will help integrate deciston-making and
Tanpower-absorbing conditions with lhe social structures surrounding the use of natural resources. It is in this context that
NGOs with the abllity to identify local prescriptions may play
a useful role in the formulation, processing and implementatlon of the Bank’s development programs and projects

The Bank is preparing a manual on environmental quality
standards for the design and operation of development projects. The manual alms to assist DMC officials establish realistic
standards for the treatment of domestic and industrial wastes
and atmospheric emissions. A second aim is to assess the costs
involved in meeting these standards and their affordability.
In regard to the fatler, a procedure is being developed relating

the selected environmental quality standards to an index of
economle affluence--ensuring that the choice and adoption
of standards can be phased to reflect the socio-economic conditions of a given DMC, The Bank is considering the introduc

tion of a safe minimum standard for use in project processing
and implementation equivalent te engineerlng codes of practice. Items would include the need to avoid the destruction
of environmentally-sensitive areas such as mangroves and
tropical forests, to protect rare and endangered species and
to accommodate cultural sensitivities, particularly those of
tribal/ethnic minorities,

Information from remote sensing and other systems is expected to influence the planning and design of programs and
Projects, especially in relation to ecologically-sensitive areas,
As an emerging technology, new methods of application such
as geographic Information systems are rapidly becoming
available. Other techniques such as simulation modelling will
be used to move the focus of development beyond site-specific
concerns to understand better the environmental dynamics
of food supplies and other goads and services.

Other activities likely to be promoted by the Bank include
integrated pest management, biological methods of fertility
management, the design of agro-ecosysiem programs to deal
with the development of upland or marginal Jands and the
conservation of natural resources and ecologically-sensitive
areas. The treatment of hazardous wastes, occupational health
and safety and risk assessment of large industrial plants are
other areas demanding the Bank's attention.

All this supposes a partnership between the Bank and its
DMCs. Through discussions, institutional strengthening programs or other means, the Bank hopes to assist in the more
systematic application of environmental planning and management, to protect natural resources while protecting the
environment,

There {s a growing consensus that an intellectual leap has
been taken in the development cammunily — that of
establishing sustainable development as the norm of economic
development. Increasingly common is the situation where
natural resources are mobilized under carefully-designed pro
grams to address the problems of burgeoning populations,
unemployment and rural impoverishinent.

Many of the tools to address these problems are in place
— environmental quality management, conservation
strategies, land use and natural resources planning, remote
sensing, the traditional wisdom of cultures. But they need to
be integrated into a coherent pattern If economic development ts to be assured,Deer cca mall

Loan and Equity Operations

BANK lending in 1987 took the form of project and multiproject, program and seclor loans and credit lines, including
development finance institutions (DFls) and agricultural credit.

Bank lending, including private sector loans, in 1987
amounted to $2,438.5 million, an increase of about 22 per
cent over 1986. Loans from ordinary capilal resources (OCR)
totalled $1,480.9 million, an 8 per cent increase over the
1986 level of $1,368 million, Loans from the Asian Development Fund (ADF) amounted to $957.6 iillion, a 51 percent
rise over the $636 million total in 1986.

The strong growth in lending was largely due ta the sharp
increase in ADF loans. In 1987, the Bank decided to permit
Indonesia to borrow ADI funds and the Bank’s Jending to
Bangladesl also rose substantially. The modest increase in
OCH lending was helped by loaris to the People’s Republic
of China and India. ‘The Bank’s renewed ermphasis on sector
loans also contributed to the higher lending level.

in addition to its lending operutions, the Bank approved
eight equity operations totalling $22.8 million. This will assist
six private enterprises and one regional venture. Vhis inckided

During the year, 52 loans were approved for 48 projects
in 17 developing member countries (DMCs}. This compares
with the same number of loans and projects in 19 DMCs in
1986. The average size of loans increased in 1987 to $46.9
million from $38,5 million in 1986. The average size of OCR
loans rose to $67.3 raillion In 1987 from $50.7 million in
1986. The average size of ADF loans increased lo $31.9
million from $25.4 million in the same period

Loans financed exclusively from OCR were provided to
People’s Republic of China, India, Republic of Korea, Malaysia
and Philippines. “Blended” loans from OCR and ADF were
provided to Indonesia, Pakistan and Papua New Guinea.
DMCs which received loans exclusively from ADF were
Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cook Islands, Lao PDR, Maldives,
Nepal, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka and Vanuatu (see page
138)

Co-financing increased slightly to $498 million in 1987 from
$492 million in 1986. Official sources of co-financing declined
by 25 per cent to $286 maillion from $379 million and their
share of total co-financing dropped to 57 per cent from 77
per cent in the same period. Co-financing from commercial
sources, at $212 million, rose significantly over the 1986 figure
of $113 millon, or 43 per cent of the total compared with
23 per cent a year earlier.

lines, program and secior loans ~~ had an estimated total cost
of $4.8 billion, of which 51 per cent was accaunted for by
fank financing, 39 per cent was to be provided by borrowing DMCs and 10 pex cent was to be provided by co-financiers.

Local cost financing in 1987 amounted to $440.8 million
for 23 projects in 13 DMCs. OCR provided $106.4 million
of this amount, and ADF $334.4 million, representing 7 per
cent and 35 per cent, respectively, of OCR and ADF loans
approved during the year

The Bank’s cumulative lending by the end of 1987 had
reached $21.8 billion for 793 projects in 29 DMCs, of which
$14.7 billion was from OCR and $7. 1 billion from ADF. About
$2.1 hillton had been provided for local cost financing.

Bank’s Role in Resource Transfers

According to its Charter, one of lhe Bank’s main purposes
is to make additional development finance available for the
development of the region. In this role, the Bank’s tasks include creating and fostering conditions that will promote improved domestic savings and the inflaw of development
assistance from outside the region.

The Bank's net transfer of resources from OCR peaked in
the early 1980s and has since declined. The measure of theBank's net transfer of resources to its JYMCs involves the gross
disbursement of loans less repayments of principal and
payments to the Bank of interest or other charges. OCR gross
disbursements rose at a rapid rate during the 1970s and then
stabilized in the 1980s close to the $700 million level, {n 1987,
including private sector operations, lhere was a negative net
transfer of OCR in the amount of $359.5 million (see Table
on page 167).

Gross disbursements are a function of both the level of
cumulative commitments and the disbursement performance.
While cormmitment levels have continued to rlse, the disburse
ment ratios have declined due to the limited absorptive
capacities in many DMCs and the lack of local currency
counterpart funds. As these problems have been eased by the
Bank through special assistance, the adoption of quickdisbursing adjustment lending, ihe establishment of resident
offices and other measures to speed up disbursements, the
levels of gross disbursement should grow again in the latter
pait of the 1980s. Such renewed growth will be necessary
to offset the rising loan repayments that have resulted in

Certain countries such as Hong Kong, Singapore and
‘Taipei, China are obviously in the net repayments phase, given
their lack of need tor further borrewings. The same applies
to the Republic of Korea where new borrowings have been
reduced and, as a result, net transfers have been negative since
1985. Worrisome, perhaps, haye been the Instances of
negalive transfers during recent years in DMCs such as Fiji,
Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand

The Bank's net transfer of resources from the ADF has continued to grow andl amounted to $480.3 million in 1987 (see
Table on page 169), Gross disbursements continued to ex

to both ADF and OCR resources, the net rransfers under ADF
serve to increase sharply the Bank’s overall net transfer to these
countries,

As regards the Bank’s overall performance, the positive and
rising net transfers from ADF offset the negative transfers fruim
OCR in 1986 and 1987, yielding a positive overall position
ia both years (see Graph on page 34). In 1987, there was
a net transfer from the Bank of $120.8 suillion, While the
Bank's recent experience has been unsatisfactory, corrective
measures now in place should help to rectify the situation in
the latter part of the 1980s.

The Bank's recent experience has not, in fact, been out of
line with other official and multilateral donors. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (GECD) has
compiled statistics on net resource flows (disbursements less
principal repayments) up to 1986. On this basis of net
disbursements, the Bank has increased its share of official
financing to aver 7 per cent up to 1985, While there was a
decline in 1986 to under 6 per cent, the OECD statistics for
official financing in thal year are stil] preliminary and appear

overstated, The Bank’s share of multilateral financing peaked
at around 20 per cent during the period 1984-86, The increasing share of multilateral financing being assumed by the
Bank reflects its standing with its DMCs in the region, Given
the start of lending to India in 1986 and to the People’s
Republic of China in 1987, this role will po doubl expand.

Sectoral Review

To date, the agriculture and agro-industry sector, the main
propellant of economic growth In most DMCs, has accounted
for about one-third of cumulative Bank lending and over half
tts grant-financed tectinical assistance (see Tables on pages
144 and 164). In 1987, however, the share of loans ta this
sector declined to about 22 per cent of the total from a peak
of 41 per cent a year earlier, The fall reflected the approval
of a number of very large Juans in other sectors as well as
the deferral to 1988 of some projects for political and economle
reasons,In the same period, lending for transport and communica:
tions rose to 33 per cent of the total from 9 per cent in 1986
while the share of industry and non-fuel minerals {including
development banks) increased to 26 per cent fram 5 per cent.
The share of lending for energy projects fell to 14 per cent
from 26 per cent a year earlier, The share of social infrastruc:
ture projects declined to 6 per cent from 14 per cent over the
same period.

Agriculture remains the most important sector of Bank
operations, and the relative decline in lending in 1987 is
regarded as a temporary phenomenon reflecting the cyclical
nature of lending to certain sectors. During the year, 16 loans
totalling $529 million were approved for a range of agricultural
projects. Hank lending and technical assistance emphasized
the sustainable development of water resources and higher
agricultural productivity through support for fuller utilization
of existing irrigation facilities, the development of new irrigation and flood protection facilities. the promotion of mixed
cropping, the importation of crucial inputs (such as diesel fuel

Bank assistance for agricultural research expanded
significantly in 1987, and will receive increased emphasis in
the future, Such assistance will continue to concentrate on
strengthening the capacity of international, regional and
national agricultural research centers to research and transfer
to the region appropriate high-priority technologies.

Lending to the transport and communications sector rose
sharply in 1987 ta $794 million. The Bank recognizes that
the capacity of transport and communications Infrastructure
in many DMCs has become inadequate, and lending for roads,
ports, railways and telecommunications is, therefore, expected
to remain relatively high in future.

In the highways subsector, the Bank approved six loans for
road maintenance and rehabilitation including two sector
loans.

Four loans were approved In the ports subsector, one for
port development in India and three others for port rehabilitation projects in other DMCs, During the year, the Bank also
approved a $190 million loan for a railways project in India.

Lending for industry and non-fuel minerals {including
development banks} reached a new high of $645.5 million,
including $20.5 million without goverment guarantee to the
private sector, Improved industrlal performance and prospects
in several DMCs led to a substantial increase in the demand
for Bank funds for onlending ta small-scale and medium-scale
privete enterprises through financial intermediaries. As a result,
the Bank extended credil lines tolalling $475 million to
development finance institutions during the year. Through
these credit lines, the Bank has associated Itself with the growth
and development of national development banks and with
an increasing number of commercial banks in some DMCs.

During the year, the Bank approved its first blended loan
undez its new program lending modality totalling $150 milllon
to Indonesia in support of a program of policy reforms and
promotional measures for enlarging and diversifying its non
oil exports. For the first time, the Bank directly financed private
industrial enterprises in Bangladesh and India,

The Bank continued to contribute te the development of
DMC financial systems through technical assistance for
strengthening existing interrnediarles and establishing new ones
in such specialized areas as venture capital and investment
funds, as well as through sector studies and policy advice

The Bank paid close attertion to the development of DMC
securities markets. In a major new initiative, it took the lead
in the creation of a regional mutual fund — the Asian Development Equity Fund — for attacting surplus resources from
developed countries into equity markets in DMCs, It also
extended technical ‘assistance for the privatization of public
enterprises.

Laans to the energy sector amounted to $332 million. This
assistance covered rehabllitation, transmission and distribu
tion works itt two DMCs and new capacity in two others. Support was also provided for converting existing oil-fired
generating plants to coal-fired plants in the People’s Repubtic
of China. In addition, the Bank made three loans for oil and
gas development and gas transmission. A regional energy data
workshop was held and assistance provided for the prepara
tion of an energy issues paper for the Association of South
East Asian Nations (ASEAN) region.

The Bank approved loans totalling $136 million for five projects in the social infrastructure sector; three for water supply
and sanitation, one for education and one for health and
population.

The Bank recognizes that the improvement of water supply and sanitation facilities is of critical importance te the health

“and socio-economic progress of Asia and the Pacific. In the

past, it has contributed substantially to the improvement and
expansion of water supplies in major urban centers and helped
teduce the problems caused by inadequate and overloaded
seweraye systems, In recent years the Bank has direcled its
financing towards projects in provincial towns and rural areas.
The Bank alsa emphasizes the rehabilitation of existing water
supply systems and the reduction of non-revenue water.
During 1987, the Bank approved a water supply project and
4 sewage treatment project in the Republic of Korea and an
urban centers sewerage project in Bhutan

In the education subsector, the Bank approved one loan
in 1987, responding te the specific need to expand vocational
education and develop skilled marypower for industrialization
in Malaysia. Technical assistance projects were also approved for project preparatory, advisory and operational and
regional purposes. .

No loans were approved in the urban development and
housing subsector but considerable policy review, sector study
and project preparatory work were carried out. In addition,
a regional seminar on major national urban policy issues was
held and an urban sector profile study carried out in the
Philippines.

In the health and population subsector, one loan was
approved and considerable sector and project preparatory
work undertaken. Moreover, a regional seminar was held in
Manila on health care financing. The health and population
sector in Bangladesh was reviewed. In addition, technical
assistance projects were approved to prepare hospital
upgrading/development and health manpower and training
projects,

Technical Assistance
Role of Technical Assistance and Its Funding

Technical assistance again played a key role in the Bank's
operations during 1987. tts main function is to facilitate the
transfer of resources and technology tio DMCs by assisting
then tu design, formulate, implement and operate development projects efficiently and effectively. Technical assistance
is also used ta enhance DMC capability to formulate economic
development strategies, policies, programs and plans to
improve the allocalion of scarce domestic and extemal
resources

Technical assistance activities are financed by the Bank
through grants and loans and combinations of both, Funding
sources available for grant-financed technical assistance
activities comprise: ({) vohintary contributions lo the Technical

During 1987, a total of $143 million in technical assistance
loans and grants was provided for 158 projects, including
regional activities. Of this amount, $42 million was grantfinanced ($26 million by the Bank and $16 million by other
sources) and $101 million was loan-financed ($96 million by
the Bank and $5 million by co-financiers).

the 1987 total amount, 57 per cant was provided for advisory
and project implementation purposes, 25 per cent for project preparation and 18 per cent for regional activities.

Seventy-two per cent, or $24.6 raillion of the total amount,
of technical assistance grants to DMCs in 1987 went to countries fully eligible for ADF loans.

The agriculture and agro-industry sector retained the largest
share of the total amount of grant-financed technical assistance
with 31 per cent, although this was a considerable decline from
50 per cent in 1986. Energy accounted for 16.6 per cent,

followed by sucial infrastructure with 16,5 per cent. Both sec-,

tors registered an increase from 9 per cent each in 1986.
Transport and communications accounted for 15.1 percent,
down from 23,5 per cent the previous year. Industry and nonfuel minerals accounted for 10 per cent and multisector and

a With the Bank acting as Executing Agency

For most of its technical assistance projects financed from
other sources, the Bank acts as Executing Agency. Such projects were financed in 1987 by agencies including the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Governments of Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland. For the
preparation of agricultural projects, the Bank also continued
to cooperate with organizations such as the Food and
Agriculture Organization/Investment Centre (FAO/IC}, the
Internatlonal Rice Research Institute (IRR) and the [nternational Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI).

The importance of technical assistance to the Bank’s overall
lending program is highlighted by the fact that, as of the end
of 1987, 352 Bank loan projects amounting to $10 billion had
resulted from earlier project preparatory Lectinical assistance
grants amaunting to $72.6 million (the total amount of pro}ect preparatory technical assistance approved was
$244 million), In 1987, 25 Bank loan projects totalling
$1,127 million resulted from eailier technical assistance. Of
this amount, $454.4 million care froran OCR and $672.3
milhon frorn ADF, representing 31 per cent and 70 per cent,
respectively, of total loans approved during the year from these
sources.

Regional technical assistance grants in 1987 amounted tu
$7.5 million for 39 projects compared with $7.4 million for
33 projects in 1986, During the year, 29 per cent of the total
amount for regional activities went to lraining, 34 per cent
to studies and workshops; 21 per cent to research; 14 per
cent to conferences and seminars and 2 per cent to other activities. [n 1987, 101 grant-financed technical assistance projects were completed, bringing the total number of such proj
ects completed to 751.

Loan-Financed Technical Assistance

During 1987, technical assistance components of loans
ineluded $2.2 million for project preparation activities, a sharp
decrease of 68 per cert from 1986, and about $99 million

for project implementation and advisory technical assistance
activities, an increase of 18 per cent over the previous year.

Group A {low-income} DMCs received about 35 per cent
of the total amount of loan-flnanced technical assistance
approved in 1987 compared with 42 per cent during 1986.
Group B (middle-income) DMCs received 59 per cent, compared with 53 per cent in 1986, and Group C (higher-income)
DMCs received 6 per cent in 1987 compared with 5 per cent
in 1986.

The sectoral distribution of the total amount of loan-financed
teclinical assistance approved in 1987 included 46 per cent
to the agriculture sector and 39 per cent lo transport and communications. This was followed by 10 per cent to energy, 3
per cent to industry and non-fuel minerals and 2 per cent to
social infrastructure.

Total Volume uf Technical Assistance

By the end of 1987, the Bank's technical assistance had
been provided for 1,706 projects and regional activities in 29
DMCs aad totalled $1.7 billion. Of that assistance, about 75
per cent was financed by Bank loans and 17 per cent by grants
financed by the Bank and other sources but executed by the
Bank, The remaining 8 per cent was financed and executed
by other sources under co-financing arrangements.

As of the end of 1987, 41 per cent of cumulative technical
assistarice to DMCs had been provided to Group A DMCs,
51 per cent to Group B DMCs and 8 per cent to Group C
DMCs. Among Group A DMCs, 21 per cent of the total
amount of technical assistance provided went to six leastdeveloped countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, J.ao
PDR, Maldives and Nepal). Two per cent of the total went
te Group A DMCs in the South Pacific (Cook Islands, Kiribati,
Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu and Western Samoa).

The sectoral distribution of the total amount of technical
assistance provided to DMCs during 1967-87 is 41 per cent
to agriculture and ‘ayre-industry, 19 per cent to social infrastructure, 17 per cent to the energy sector, 16 per cent to
transport and communications, 5 per cent to industry and nontuel tninerals, including development finance institutions and
2 per cent to the multiseclor and others,

Training and Institutional Development

Human resources clevelopment is a prerequisite to sociueconomic growth in developing countries. In recognition of
this, the Bank emphasizes education and training to develop
skilled manpower and also to equip key personnel with
knowledge and skills required for effective job performance
under its loan and techriical assistance projects as well as other
operational programs such as its regional seminars and
workshops, Efforis to enhance scientific literacy and accelerate
technological advancement in its DMCs are also supported
by the Bank.

In 1987, the Bank approved 48 loan projects of which 19
had education and training components totalling $101.4
million. These Included a loan of $68.8 million for the ThirdVocalional Education Project in Malaysia, under which about
120 teacher trainers will attend specialized tralning courses
overseas and 150 will undergo in-country training
Appropnate staff development and training components were
selectively included as an essential part of development
projects in all sectors to assist the executing agencies to manage
implementation effectively. In some cases, the training programs are aimed at institution-building to strengthen the
beneficiary agency's capacity to fulfill its functions efficiently
For example, in Indonesia, the Third lirigation Sector loan
provides $3.5 million for local training for extension agents,
seed inspectors as well as key farmers, In the East Rapti
Irrigation Project in Nepal, $3.7 million was set aside to assist
implementation and for local training in irrigation operations
and maintenance

Several methods are employed for training DMC personnel. They include offering fellowships for specific sludies in
countries with appropriate training arrangements (one example

of this in 1987 was the Fisheries Research and Development
Project in Malaysia which contained a substantial fellowship
training component): engaging specialist consultants elther to
conduct on-site training courses (as in the Paper Mul Project
in Nepal approved in 1987) or to work with host country staff
and initiate a process of on-the-job training; arranging study
and observation tours for technical staff {as in the Third Vocational Education Project in Malaysia}; and promoting collaborative arrangements between expatriate and domestic consultants to ensure a steady transfer of technology as part of
cerlain projects,

In addition to supporting training components of loan projects, a total of $3.5 million was provided for education and
training in project preparatory and advisory and operational
technical assistance projects during the year. Technical
assistance was widely used to ascertain institutional, educational and manpower weaknesses in DMCs, and design a
training response tailored to meet them. For example, the

Regional evelopment (Sector} Project Assisted by a Bunk loan of $45 million, the project is aimed at developing community

facilities and employment opportunities in rural areasMisheries Sector Economy Study in Indonesia, for which the
Bank provided technical assistance in 1987, was designed,
among other things, lo provide training to key personnel in
the fisheries sector.

Another majer program of the Bank's training activities is
the regional technical assistance under which specialized
seminars and workshops ara conducted for the benefit of the
key personnel of DMCs (see page 161}. The total amount
expended on training components under such programs in
1987 was $2.5 million. Some of these were designed to raise
the standard of development management in the region, for
example, two regional technical assistance projects provided
training programs which focused on raising the development
management ability of senior managers in development
finance institutions in Asia and the South Pacific, One of the
regional technical assistance programs enabled key person:
nel from varlous DMCs to attend the Regional ‘Training
Program in Vegetable Preduction and Research (Phase I])
which focused on the dissemination of modern technology
in vegetable production and research. A similar program also
financed the parlicipation of key officials from the Bank’s South
Pacific DMCs in the Statistical Manpower Training in the South
Pacific. In addition, seminars on procurement, use of consultants and project implementation management were conducted in various DMCs.

In recent years, there has heen an increase in projects which
address central manpower issues in DMCs while others seek
to provide an educational base - in major areas such as
agriculture, engineering or basic science /technical education
-» for creating skills necessary for economic growth.

Private Sector Assistance Activities

Direct support for private enterprises increased substantially
in 1987, reflecting the continuing priority accorded by the
Bank to assisting the private sector in DMCs anid the growing
institutional capabilities of the Bank in this area, Direct loans
wilhout government guarantee to the private sector arnounted
to $20 5 million, up from $11.5 million in 1986. Approvals
of equity, including lines af equity, rose to $22.8 million!
fron: $8,2 million the previous year. The Bank also approved
three equity projects amounting tu $1 inillion from previously
approved lines of equity.

Total Board approvals of direct private sector financing
lequity and ioans withoul government guarantee) amounted
to $43.3 millon? in 1987, substantially higher than the $19.6
million in 1986, Cumulative Board approvals of such financing, less cancellations, amounted to $67.8 million.2

The equity investments and loans approved during the year
will assist six private enterprises Jn four DMCs, as well as a
regional venture. A polyester fiber project in India, the first
private enterprise in the country to be assisted by the Bank,
received a loan of $16 million and an equity investment of
$3 million from the Bank, as well as a complementary com
1) In addition, the Kank made an inderwriting commitment of $5 million in
the Aslan Development Equity Fund.
2 Exelusive of a complementary loan amounting lo $5 million,

mercial loan of $5 million arranged by the Bank. A beginning in the Bank’s direct pyivate sector operations in
Bangladesh was alse made during the year, with the approval
of an equity investment of $4 million and a loan of $2.5 million
for a textile mill

A loan of $2 million, combined with an equity investment
of $0.6 million, was approved for a new leasing company in
Pakistan. In addition, the Bank approved invesiments of $3
million each in the equity of two young venture capital com panies in the Republic of Korea. The Bank also approved two
lines of equity, one for $2 million for investment in the
Republic of Korea and one for $5 million for investment in
India. Three investments totalling $1 million were approved
for relatively small enterprises - - iwo in Indonesia and one
in Pakistan — under previously approved lines of equity. A
notable accomplishment of the Bank during the year was its
sponsorship of a new $100 million regional mutual fund to
mobilize surplus funds in developed countries for investments
in equities in DMCs. The Bank undertook to subscribe $5
milion to the fund and underwrite another $5 million of its
share issue. A technical assistance grant of $319,000 was
extended to facilitate a study of privatizing a state enterprise
in Malaysia.

The Bank's equity investment operations were launched
in 1983, and were supplemented in 1986 by a facility for direct
lending to DMC private enterprises without government
guarantee, Since then, the Board of Directors has approved,
cumulatively, $38 million of equity facilities and $32 millicn!
in loans without government guarantee. The equity approvals
Include lines of equity totalling $17.25 million. These lines
represent cooperative arrangements with selected financial
institutions, which function essentially as the Bank's investment agents and advisors, The Bank’s irwestment decisions
under these arrangements are made on the basis of the
associated institutions’ project evaluation and recommendations, supplemented by Bank staff inputs where necessary.
The Bank also ralles on the institutions in portfolio managerent. These arrangements enable the Bank to provide and
mobilize the flow of scarce equity funds to relatively small
private enterprises, making use of the existing inslilutiona}
infrastructure in the countries concerned.

The Bank has also played a significant catalytic role in its
direct assistance to private enterprises. In keeping with this
role, the Bank’s total assistance (equity and loan) to a single
enterprise is limited to 25 per cent of the project cast, with
the Bank's equity participation not exceeding 20 per cent of
the beneficiary company's capital. The Bank's association with
an enterprise enables it to mobilize substantial additional
funding from other sources — domestic and foreign — and
facilitate transfer of technology and managerial skills from
abroad. The direct assistance of $22.5 million approved by
the Bank during the year to the two companies in Bangladesh
and India have helped them implement projects involving an
aggregate investment of $127 million.

The Bank's suppert for the private sector in IMCs,
however, continues to be provided largely through credit lines
to selected financial intermediaries for onlending Bank funds

for investment by small-size and medium-size productive
private enterprises, During 1987, such credit lines approved
by the Bank totalled $475 million, These included the largest
Bark Joan so far, an umbrella credit line of $200 million for
siroultaneous use by four development banks and lwo commercial banks in Pakistan; a $100 million credit Jine ta the
China Investment Sank, representing the first Bank loan to
the People's Republic of China; 2 $100 million credit line to
an apex development bank in India for relencing to.a group
of selected financial institutions functioning in different states
of the country; another apex loan of $15 million toa development hank in Sri Lanka to be made avallable to another
development bank and four commercial banks; and a $60

 

tiillion second credit line to a development bank in Indonesia
These operations have enabled the Bank lo efter into or
continue discussions with the governments concerned on
various policies relating to the development of the financial
sector, including the securities market.

As part of its efforis lo strengthen the institutional capabilities
of financial intermediaries, the Bank approved a technical
assistance grant of $90,000 for a study to improve the loan
recovery process in Indonesia, and anather grant of $350,000
for compuiterizing the operations and taining the staff of a
development finance institution (DFI) in the People's Republic
of China. In addition, the Bank approved two technical
assistance grants of $60,000 and $40,000 to help establish
venture capital companies in Pakistan and Thailand, respectively. Up to $500,000 of the loan to Sti Lanka was earmarked
to finance technical assistance for setting up an Export
Development Fund in the country.

On completion of the Bank's study on leasing in seven
DMCs, the Bank held a workshop during October, financed
by a technical assistance grant, to discuss the main study findings and recommendations and to explore other avenues for
developing leasing in DMCs. Another technical assistance
grant was approved for oryanizing a seminar on various
aspects of venture capital financing in DMCs, as a follow-up
to the recent Bank study of such financing in five DMCs, A
third such grant approved during the year facilitated Bank
sponsorship, jointly with the International Finance Corporation, of a symposium in early 1988 on the recent trends
In foreign direct investment in DMCs and the near-term
prospects.

Program Lending Policy

In November 1987, the Board approved a new program
lending policy designed to meet medium-term sector development needs and thereby more effectively address the development and adjustrwen! requirements of DMCs. The new policy
provides quick-disbursing financial resources in support of a
distinct sector adjustment program.

Program lending is not a new instrument for the Bank. Since
1978, the Bank has provided program lending by promoting
increased capacity utilization through financing imported inputs. This helped solve capacity utilization problems in highpriority areas. But the new policy focuses on the implemen
tation of a sector development program.

A sector development program will cover a varying mix of
poticy adjustments, improved investment programs and
institutional enhancement, It will be consistent with Rank
strategy for the concerned DMC: and alm at achieving sectoral
goals over a three to five-year period through the implementation of paticy changes

A seclor development program needs to cover the full range
of sector policy issues. In most sectors, the Bank will review
the adequacy of praducer incentives and assess the degree
of sectoral reliance on market forces with a view to ensuring
future adaptations lo changing clrcumstances and efficient
resource allocation, [n addition, such a program will be concerned with the level and compasition of the sectoral invest-ment program as well as with recurrent expenditures to ensure the maintenance of new investments and future growth.
Furthermore, the program will address the adequacy of institutional support and provide for upgrading if required. Finally, in respect to any unresolved policy areas, sector studles
could be commissioned in conjunction with the loan to promote continued policy dialogue and adjustment. Technical
assistance may be provided for these purposes.

Total program loans of the Bank are subject to a ceiling of
15 per cent of total! Bank lending. This ceiling is to be interpreted flexibly over a three-year moving average centered on
the current year to accommodate years in which DMCs could
make heavy demands on the new facility.

The size of program loans will be set at a level sufficient
to offer meaningful support for secter development and
Institutional changes and to facilitate effective policy implementation. The amount will also depend on the scope of the program, the importance of the sector and other sector-specific
considerations. The size of the total lending program in the
DMC may also be a factor, although there is no ceiling to the
amount of program loans extended to a specific country.

Under this facility, there is considerable flexibility to meet
a DMC’s developmental needs. The foan proceeds are used
to finance economy-wide or sector-specific import
requirements on the basis of a negative or positive import list.
Once loan proceeds are disbursed against imports, local currency counterpart funds are generated that may be used by
the government for general development purposes or on a
case-by-case basis for the developmental needs of a specific
secior.

The approach to disbursement and procurement under program lending is more flexible than that for project loans. To
facilitate disbursements, a liberal use of imprest accounts is
recommended and liberal reimbursement will be allowed for
imports incurred during a period up to 180 days before the
loan becomes effective. Depending on the borrowing DMC’s
circumstances, the Bank may decide that a certain percentage of the loan will be disbursed through the Bank's standard
cominitrient and reimbursement procedures. With regard to
procurement, the Bank’s standard ceiling of $300,000,
beyond which international competitive bidding is required,
has been lifted.

in December 1987, the Bank approved the first loan under
the new facility with a $150 million Non-Oil Export Promotion Prograrn loan to Indonesia. The loan supports Indonesia’s
policies to stimulate non-oil exports. ‘hese policies are part
of a continuing trend towards deregulation and liberalization,
with a greater role for the privaie sector. Under the lean, the
Bank will continue its dialogue with the Indonesian Governtment to review the impact of policy measures already introduced and the progress in implementing further reforms.

Disaster Rehabilitation

In duly 1987, the Board approved a new emergency
rehabilitation facility to assist small island DMCs in rapidly
restoring vital econornic infrastructure and social services
following damage caused by natural disasters. Stressing the

urgency of such rehabilitation measures, the Bank aims ta process disaster rehabilitation loans within six weeks of receiving
such a loan request and also to apply liberally its procurement
and disbursement procedures

ADF Lending Policy

In November 1987, the Board approved a number of important policy changes for the ADF V period (1987-90). These
included renewing access to ADF resources to Indonesia and
the Philippines, a new ADF/OCR blend policy for Pakistan
and Papua New Guinea, a reduction in ADF maturily periods
to 35 years from 40 years for countries with blended loans
and providing access to ADF funds earmarked for TASF to
the poorer DMCs.

Co-Financing

A total of 27 Bank projects were.co-financed in 1987, including the first project co-financed In the private sector. The
total was a gmall increase over the 23 projects co-financed
in 19%6, Contributions of co-financiers increased slightly to
$498 million in 1987 from $492 million In 1986, with the
Bank's contribution increasing to $1,209 million from $752.
million in the same period. As of the end of 1987, 242 Bank
projects had Involved co-financing, with co-financiers providing about $6.3 billion and the Bank $8.8 billion.

While economic growl in most of the Bank’s DMCs
showed improvement over the previous year, domestic
resource constraints and debt-service burdens continued to
affect adversely co-financing activity. However, projects in
sectors which are traditionally attractive to co-financiers ~- such
as those relating to energy, including ail and gas, industry and
development banks — recovered in 1987. Thirteen of the 27
co-financed projects were in these sectors. In addition, there
were six co-financed projects in the agriculture and agroindustry sector, five in the transport and communications sector and three in the social infrastructure sector.

New initiatlves were undertaken in 1987 to diversity both
sources und recipients of co-financing funds. The conclusion
of a framework arrangement with the Exporl-lnport Bank of
dapan facilitated co-financing in a number of projects. New
official bilateral sources were also tapped for co-financing.
Bilateral sources, namely Canada, Desinark, Federal Republic
of Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Singapore,
Sweden, United Kingdom and United States provided $253
million for 12 projects. Multilateral sources — the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP}, the Intemational
Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World
Bank — provided $33 million for 11 projects. The Bank cofinanced a port project in the Philippines with Singapore for
the first time. This assistance is part of the Singapore Governwent $5 million technical assistance package offered to the
Philippine Government.

Co-financing with export credit/commercial sources
increased to $212 million, or 43 per cent of total co-financing,
for seven projects compared with $113 ruillon, or 23 per cent,fur four projects in 1986, Whit continuing economic growth
expected in the Bank’s DMCs during 1988, co-financing from
these sources should also increase as energy, power and industrial projects, deferred in the past, continue to re emerge.

The Bank continued to mobilize external grant assistance
to complement the Bank’s technical assistance operations. Of
the 141 grant-financed technical assistance projects totalling
$41.8 million, which were approved in 1987, $15.8 million
for 24 projects was financed by extemal sources. The
assistance was provided by UNDP and the Governments of
Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland.

The Bank is actively considering a guarantee facility to provide additional resources from private financial institutions to
co finance projects in the Bank's lending programs. Such
resources, under the Bank's guarantee, are expected to have
more favorable terms than would otherwise be available to
DMCs from these institutions.

Development Resource Center Activities

Activities of the Bank as a Develonment Resource Center,
which include disserninating information and assisting in the
strengthening of institutions and policy frameworks armong its
DMCs, were further extended in 1987,

Due to significant changes in the international economic environment, many DMCs gave high priority io effective resource
mobllization, efficient resource allocation and investment
activity, Continued policy dialogue between the Bank and its
DMCs led to a better appreciation of these needs and how
to cope with them, The Bank’s research programs were also
geared to understanding, and coping with, changed
circumstances.

In 1987, the Bank carried out an analysis of energy issues
in ASEAN at the requesl of ASEAN Energy Ministers and provided research support to the minerals and energy activilies
of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference in Seoul.
Additionally, the Bank organized a Regional Energy Data
Workshop jointly with the International Energy Agency and
published Energy Policy Experiences of DMCs and Energy
Indicators of Major Developing Member Countries of ADB

The Bank's Economic Staff Papers and the Economics Ot
fice Report Series widely disseminaled the research findings
in national Issties such as Agricultural Price Policy in Nepal,
The Implications of Fulling Commodity Prices for Agricultural
Strategy in the Philippines and Factors Influencing the Cholee
of Location: Lacal and Foreign Firms in the Philippines and
internationat issues such as Domestic Adjustment to External
Shocks in Developing Asia and Determining Inigation
Charges: A Framework.

The development of economic analysis and personnel training were promoted through Bank programs in selected DMCs,
For example, technical assistance has been provided for the
development of national accounts in Western Sainva and
Vanualu and programs for statistical traning in the South
Pacific DMCs. In addition, there are programs for the construction of quarterly national accounts in Indonesia and the

Improvement of short-term ecuncmic policy analysis in
Thaitand

 

Studies were also completed on the Role of Fertilizer Subsidies in Agricultural Production: A Review of Selected Issues;
Finaricing of Public Sector Development Expenditure in sayen
DMCs and on Demographic-Economlc Forecasting: Pitot
Study for Thailand, Research programs were ongoing Ina
Study of Selected Industries of OMCs; Informal Credit
Markets; Smail and Medium-Scule Manufacturing Industries
and on Human Resources in Relation to Development. In addition, ongoing programs included the industrial Future Study;
Structural Change to 2000; and Foreign Barriers to Exports
of DMCs, At the international level, the Bank continued its
Participation and coniribution to the LINK project, coordinated
by Nobel Laureate Lawrence Klein,

The Asian Development Review continued tu disseminate
widely contributions by renowned writers and Bank staff on
development issues. The Bank’s Distinguished Speakers Program provided a forum for international experts to address
Bank staff and other concerned individuals.

Research and training programs and seminars continued
to be organized in collaboration with national, regional and
international institutions. Such programs were organized -In
1987 with the Asian-Pacific Bankers Club, the International
Energy Agency, the International Finance Corporation, the
Pacific Trade and Development Conference, the East-West
Center, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific, the Association of Development Financing Institutions In Asia and the Pucific and the Association of Develop
ment Financing Institutions in the Pacific. Greater stress was .

placed on collaboration with national institutes as a means of
drawing on available expertise, strengthening institutional
structures and focusing further attention on important development issues.

The Fifth Annual ADB Development Round Table was convened on “The Role of the Public Sector in Development”.
This broughi together distinguished resource persons,
technocrats and policy advisers from the Bank’s DMCs to
discuss issues of topical and practical interest,

Poverty Alleviation

The Bank gives high priority in Its lending operations to the
itaprovement of living conditions of the rural and urban poor
in Asia and the Pacifie. Although progress has taken place
in the conditions of the poor, poverty is still widespread in
many lower-income DMCs and there are “poverty pockets”
even in some more advanced DMCs. High population growth
rates in many DMCs have eroded progress in poverty alleviation, Furthermore, economic adjustment problems which
many DMCs have faced In recent years have complicated the
fight against poverty. Such adjustments have involved substanlial human costs, especially among the poor and underprivileged, The Bank’s new Program Lending Policy, which was
approved by the Board in November 1987, is designed to
support sector adjiistment programs which take into account
the needs of the poor during the adjustment period.

The Bank addresses poverty In two different ways. First,
the Bank is required by its Charter to give special attention
to the needs of the poorer DMCs, thus contributing to a more46

 

balanced income distribution within the region. In 1987, Bank
lending [rom concessional resources — the Asian Develop
ment lund {ADF} — was 51 per cent higher in nominal terms
than in 1986. The share of ADF lending to overall Bank lending rose lo 39 per cent in 1987 from 32 per cert in 1986.
Eighty-five per cent of ADF funds went te the Bank’s lowIncome DMCs (Group A countries). The largest recipients
were Pakistan ($292.6 million), Bangladesh ($265.7 million),
Sri Lanka ($106.3 million} and Nepat ($91.3 million}
Second, the Bank seeks to alleviate poverty within its DMCs
through emphasizing economic growth and the efficient use
of resources. This approach has contributed to the creation
of larger employment opportunities, higher average incomes
and has helped create additional revenues for governments

to use for improving the welfare of the poor. However, experience has shown that while efforts to increase growth will
ultimately lead to an improvement in living standards, there
is also a need fora more direct assault on poverty, The Bank,
therefore, while continuing to focus on projects which promote growth, also continued to finance projects almed at increasing productivity of the poorest farmers and expanding
the social and physical infrastructure in the less developed
regions.

The Bank has given high priority te attacking rural poverty.
Projects in agriculture, rural development, irrigation and
fisheries In seven DMCs (Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysta,
Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands)
approved in 1987 will contribute to increased agricultural production, higher tnhcomes and new employment opportunities.
{t is estimated that in Pakistan about 78,600 farm households
will benefit from the Chasbina Right Bank Irrigation, the Chitral
Area Development and the Second On-Farm Water Management Projects, all approved during the year. These projects,
together with the Fruit and Vegetable Marketing Project, are
expected to create about 25,000 additional permanent jobs
and another 43,000 person-years seasonal employment opportunities. Similarly, the East Rapti Irrigation Project in Nepal
will benefit about 7,200 farm families and the Hill Fruit
Development Project will increase the incomes of about
20,000 fruit growers.

The Bank also goes beyond direct agriculture-related projects to benefit the poor in rural areas. In physical infrastruc ture, the Bank financed highway projects in Bangladesh,
Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Lao PDR and Sx Lanka which
are mainly geared towards improving or expanding rural roads
and highways. During constructlon, these projects will
generate more than 64,000 person-years of employment and
upon completion contribute to the socio-economic development of the affected regions. In social infrastructure, the Third
Health Project in Pakistan will provide access to the national
health delivery system in rernote rural areas for more than
four million people. In the fleld of energy supply, under the
Brahmaputra Gas Transmission and Distribution Project in
Bangladesh, low-cost gas. will be made available to about
176,000 househalds in one of the country’s least developed
areas.

Another way of assisting small farmers and entrepreneurs
is to provide credits channeled through DFls or other suitable
intermediaries. Such loans contribute to maintaining existing
jobs and creating new ones, thus helping to reduce unemployment and stabilizing the income of urban and rural workers
during economic adjustment periods. In 1987, the Bank approved loans totalling $499 milllon to five DFIs in People’s
Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
‘These Ioans will help increase production and employment
in the small-size and medium-size industries. It is estimated
that more than 82,000 jobs in industry and agro-processing
will be created, [n addition, about 9,000 farmers in Nepal will
be provided with agricultural credit through the Bank's fifth
loan to the Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal.

Other projects approved in 1987 aim at tmproving the quality of life of the urban population, including the poor. In
Bhutan, the Bank is financing an Urban Centers SewerageProject which will improve the urban environment, improve
health conditions and will ultimately bring sewerage facilities
to about 42,000 persons. In the Republic of Korea, the Tenth
Water Supply Project and the Fourth Sewage Treatment Projecl will benefit an urban population living in relatively poor
araas.

Women in Development

In January 1987, the Bank recruited a Project Specialist
to serve as a focal point for the Bank’s efforts in promoting
women in development (WID) and to coordinate and monitor
the implementation of WID policy within the Bank

The Bank’s policy on WID has four basic elements: (in

 

a

Bates

in an Industrial venture in the Republic of Korea {right},

   

WOMEN carry out a variely of activities in development projects such as seeding « fishpond in Nepal (left) or checking instruments

creasing the awareness of gender issues among Bank staff tak
ing inte account the role and needs of women in all relevant
facets of the development process; {ii) Preparing country profiles and briefing papers to identify special circumstances and
the socio-cultural context of individual DMCs; {ih} formulating
sector-specific guidelines. and (iv) creating a gender
disaggregated data base of selected socio-economic Indicators
te facilitate monitoring of women’s welfare. During 1987,
progress was made in all these areas.

Work has begun to achleve the ultimate aim of fully
integrating WID considerations in the ‘Bank's Operations.
Gender issues are being addressed explicitly in country
Programming activities, and county briefing profiles to facilitate
this process were prepared during the year for Nepal and
Papua New Guinea. WID considerations are also being in
 

i Eacorporated in the formulation of the Bank’s longer-term operational strategy for each DMC. During 1987, such a study was
finalized for Indonesla.

Upon completion of the sectoral guidelines and procedures
giving explicit consideration to gender issues, emphasis in
1987 shifted to incorporating such considerations into individual loan and technical assistance projects at the
preparatory stage, Project documents have been critically examined in accordance with sectoral WID guidelines, and components which provide income-generating opportunities and
direct benefits to women have been included in two projects.
‘The Bank’s first technical assistance which specifically and exclusively addresses women entrepreneurship and contribution
to production was the Study on the Role of Women in Rural
Industries, approved in May 1987. A number of other loan
and technical assistance projects has been selected for special
consideration of WID. With the gradual accumulation of information and understanding of WID issues, more integration of WID considerations in future Bank operations can be
expected.

Cooperation with NGOs

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have traditionally
been involved in socio-economic development assistance and
in providing emergency relief focusing on the poor and disadvantaged groups in rural and urban areas. In particular, they
assist these target groups at the grass-roots level in rural and
urban areas and strive to make them more self-reliant.

Since they address the same target groups as the Bank,
NGOs and the Bank complernent each other in thelr endeavor
to alleviate poverty. Closer cooperation between NGOs and
the Bank is a desirable goal.

Recognizing the important role played by NGOs, the Bank
established a policy framework for cooperation with NGOs,
which was approved by the Boars of Directors in July 1987,
The Bank’s aim is to benefit fom the experience of NGOs
in four broad areas with potential for expansion and cooperation; rural development, small-scale industries, social infrastructure and environmental protection.

The Bank plans to cooperate selectively with NGOs which
are well established and which have experience in socioaconomic activities of DMCs. Such cooperation will be based
on the merits of individual cases and will require the concurrence of IMC governments. The Bank plans to work in
parallel with NGOs to ensure that their separate identities are
in no way threatened.

In October 1987, the Bank co-sponsored the Second World
NGO Symposiurn in Nagoya, Japan, | feld under the auspices
of The Organization for Industrial, Spiritual and Cultural Advancement {OISCA}), a Japanese NGO, the Symposivin
presented an excellent opportunity for the Bank to explain
new policy measures to a large number of NGOs and DMC
governments. The Bank also actively liaised with the newlycreated NGO Division in UNDP io coordinate activities in this
field.

The Chitral Area Development Project in Pakistan,
approved in August 1987, was designed on the basis of close

collaboration and cooperation with the Aga Khan Rural Sup
port Programme, an NGO with considerable expertise in the
project area.

A technical assistance grant to Indonesia presented another
case of Bank-NGO cooperation, In this case, the dank is helping to improve the efficiency of brigation and management
systems and facilitate the turnover of irrigation system respon
sibilities from Government lo farmers in selected areas of Wast
Java and West Sumata. l’or this purpese, the Bank, jointly
with the Ford Foundation and the International Irrigation
Management Institute, is providing $970,000 towards the
study, Of this, the Ford Foundation and MIMI will provide
$300,000 and $70,000, respectively, under a cost-sharing
arrangement.

During the year, the Bank has also begun discussions with
several NGOs in the fields of environmental protection, rural
credit expansion and rural development. These efforts are ex
pected to mature into loan and technical assistance projects
in future.

Aid Coordination

‘The Bank’s DMCs receive funds from a large number of
bilateral and multilateral agencies apart from the Bank. If
development assistance is to best serve DMCs, there needs
to be continued coordination of agency activities. Agencies
need to share rescurces, expertise and experiences and to
ensure that their activities are complementary. The Bank is
therefore continuing and strengthening its efforts to couperate
with other agencies.

The Bank organized the Ninth Al95-World Bank Coordination Meeting in April 1987 at the time of the Bank’s 20th Annual Meeting. In addition, the President attended the meeting
of Heads of Multilateral Financial Institutions and the Development Committee Meeting In Washington, D.C, in SeplemberOctober 1987 and kad consultations with the President of the
World Bank.

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), an
important source of grant assistance lor the Bank’s lending
and technical assistance operations, further increased its level
of assistance. UNDP provided $14 million for 17 technica!
assistance projects including $7 million for the technical
assistance component of eight lean projects. These levels are
the highest so far in Bank operations. The Bank was
represented at UNDP's Governing Council Meeting and Inter
Agency Consultative Meeting, and contacts between Kank
staff and UNDP resident offices improved greatly. These contacts have facilitated cooperation and resulted in a number
of projecis being coinanved with the Bank. The Bank also
cooperated with the Economic and Social Commission for
Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) to bold a Workshop on thie In
ternational Comparisyun Project in October 1987 in Bangkok

Annual consultation continued with the Islamic Development Bank, where information on policy and organizational
evolution of both institutions was exchanged. The Bank also
held consultations with the Internalional Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD) during the year and entered into a cofinancing arrangement with IFAD in the Chitral Area Develop-ment Project in Pakistan,

{n June 1987, the Bank signed a framework agreement with
the Export [mport Bank of Japan, under which the Eximbank
would make available untied funds to DMCs through cofinancing arrangements with the Bank, ‘The facility would provide long-term loans at a cost slightly below the market rate
of Interest. lt is part of Japan's efforts to recycle Its balanceof-payments surplus.

The Bank purticipated regularly in aid group meetings where
aid agencies meet with government representatives to discuss
economic and social developments in DMCs, external financing and coordination. In 1987, the Bank participated in aid
group meetings for Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan,
Philippines and Sri Lanka, and in the special donors meeting
for Sri Lanka.

Since the establishment of the Bank's Bangladesh Resident
Offlee (BRO) in 1982, the Bank has actively participated in
various local consultative group meetings convened by the
Warld Bank, In addition, regular meetings on the railway sector have been canvened by BRO with other agencies where
the Bank assumes a lead role Regular monthly meetings with
UNDP on the processing of technical assistance projects have
also facilitated the Bank's operations.

The opening of the Indonesia Resident Office (IRQ) in July 1987 led to its participation in ad hoe aid coordination
meetings convened by various aid agencies, primarily to ex
 

change views on programs and to coordinate on projectrelated activities, In particular, [RO initiated extensive discusslons with OECF and the Eximbank of Japan to facilitate the
Bank’s operations in the country.

The South Pacific Regional Office (SPRO) in Port Vila,
Vanuatu, continues to maintain close liaison with agency
representatives in various South Pacific developing member
countries (SPDMCs}. Bank missions from SPRO frequently
consult with these representatives in the field on development
issues.

A highlight of the year was the Bank's Symposium-cumWorkshop on Country Development Strategies for the Bank’s
SPDMCs, held in Auckland in August. The Symposium,
which was opened-by President Fujioka and attended by
fepresentatlves of all SPDMCs and various donors, was
designed to review the recent changes in the development
environment, reassess the colleclive and individual requitemients of the SPDMCs and, if required, readjust the
Bank's role accordingly. The exchange of views at the Symposium was extremely valuable in providing the participants
with a greater understanding of the development problems
of the SPDMCs. It also highlighted the Bank’s concern to
assist, the role of the Bank and other donor agencies and Indicated possible areas of mutual cooperation. The Symposium

is expected to enhance further donor coordination in the
region,FISI I market at Navotas, just north af Manila, in the Philippines. The Fisheries Port
Project was supported by the Bank with a foan and technical assistance totalling
$5.9 million, :COUNTRY ACTIVITIES

Introduction

IN recent years lhe Bank has been increasing its efforts to
develop country strategies for its programs of assistance to
developing member countries (DMCs). Recognizing that it
should direct its lirnited resources to sectors and activitles which
can best serve DMC needs, the Bank is undertaking in-depth
country studies to evolve mediuun-term operational stategies
for Bank assistance aimed at helping the DMCs to reduce or
eliminate these constraints, Major policy issues are examined
and these are Increasingly forming the basis of frultful dialogue
between the Bank and DMC govemmenits. Details of the
Bank’s operational strateyies and programs of assistance for
its DMCs are given In this chapter,

Bangladesh

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational strategy
for Bangladesh focuses on a broad overview of priority sectors with the objective of ensuring balanced investments and
alleviation of bottlenecks to growth. Highest priorily is accorded to agriculture, followed by energy, physical infrastructure,
social infrastructure and industry. At the same time, the Bank
is prepared to assist Bangladesh in emergencies. After the
floods in 1987, the Bank quickly began processing two flood
restoration loans to assist the Government in rehabilitating
irrigation schemes, roads and zailways,

In the agriculture sector, rural development is promoted
within the context of increased food production and a concomitant increase in employment and farmers’ incomes. Bank
assistance fs also directed at agricultural cliversification. This
includes crops other than foodgrains, livestock, fisheries and
forestry. Provision of agricultural credit and assistance for basic
agricultural infrastructure in support of this stralegy are also
emphasized. In the energy sector, the Bank is concentrating
on the development of known gas fields and related gas
ansmisslon and distribution facilities as well as power generation, transmission and distribution, Increased emphasis is also
given to the development of new energy resources including
oil and coal. Bank assistance in physical infrastructure fs

directed at the transportation sector, mainly road and port
facilities, which are presently inadequate to support economic
development, In social infrastructure, the Bank is concentrating
on education and improvements to public health through safe
water supply, environmental conservation and upgrading of
health facilities. Bank involvement in the health and pepulation sector has been mainly complementary to larger-scale programs of other donoys. In the industry sector the Bank is
Primarily concerned with the promotion of private industrial
investments through development finance institutions {DF ls)
and with institutional improvements.

The policy focus of the Bank's operational strategy for
Bangladesh Is on adequate pricing and payment for goods
and services which should contribute to domestic resource
mobilization. The Bank is also seeking to enhance econamic
effictency by enlarging the scope of the market forces and the
private sector, Likewise, ernphasis is given to the operation

The Bangladesh Resident Office (BRO) started functioning in duly 1982. A five-year review conducted in 1987 concluded that BRO had effectively discharged its major function of facilitating project administration and had also contributed to increased disbursements. It had also played a useful
role in implementing Bank strategy Including country program:
ming and local ald coordination.

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1987, Bank lend
ing to Bangladesh amounted to $265.7 million for four loans
~ one each in the agriculture, energy and transport and communications sectors and one to a private sector enterprise
without government guarantee — from ADF compared to
$88.4 million for three loans in 1986. Local currency financing of $78.7 million was provided for two projects. Cofinancing amounted to $22.4 million, of which $18 million
was arranged with the Federal Republic of Germany for a
power project approved in 1983, $1.2 million with UNDP for
consultant services for a road project; $2.5 million with the
United Kingdom and $680,000 suppliers’ credit for a textile

Brahmaputra Basin Gas Transmission and Distribution Project will extend gus Gansimssion and distribution networks in
one of the least develaped ayeas of the country. The Road
Improvement Project will help reduce constraints on and increase the ‘efficiency of road transport through the improvement of selected portions of national reads. The loan to the
private sector is to Padma Textile Mills Lid. for assisting
establishing a textile mill in the country.

Eight project preparatory technical assistance grants
amounting to $1.6 million were also approved in 1987. Of
these, three grants totalling $979,000 were provided by UNDP
and one, for $179,000, was co-financed by the Government
of Norway. The Kank also approved three advisory technical
assistance grants for $4.9 million financed by UNDP, one each
in the education, roads and development banks sectors.

As of 31 December 197, the Bank had approved 73 loans
to Bangladesh amounting to $2,192,7 million for 66 projects

million from ADF. The Bank had also provided technical
assistance amounting to $42.6 million for 93 projects of which
39 had resulted in Bank loans.

Project Implementation: Of the 73 loans (including one
Special Assistance loan} approved for Bangladesh as of 31
December 1987, 29 had been completely disbursed and 44
were under administration of which five were awaiting loan
elfectivity. Four loans were closed during 1987. Disbursements
amounted to $177.1 million during 1987 compared with
$142.2 million in 1986. On a cumulative basis, $843.7 million
had been disbursed as of 31 December 1987 which represents
42 per cent of the total effective loans.

In 1987, one County Projects Review Meeting (CPRM)
was held In Hangladesh to discuss problems affecting the irnplementation of Bank-assisted projecls, The implementation
problems discussed included Insufficient letter of credit extension periods, slow submission of bid evaluation reports and
conflicts between the Bank’s procurement guidelines and
government regulations. These issues are being reviewed by
the concerned government agencles and they are expected
tu be resolved soon,

Bhutan

Operational Strategy: The long-term objectives of Bank
lending and technical assistance operations in Bhulan are to
help strengthen administration, promote the development of
physical and social infrastructure and assist the Process of
economic diversification through a gradual transformation of
Bhutan’s subsistence agriculture into more market-oriented
agricultural production and development of selected exportonented industries utilizing indigenous raw materials, These
objectives take into account the present stage of development
and economic potential. The Bank's institutional support includes the strengthening of key ministries such as the Ministries
of Agriculture and Uinance, and the setting up of anew DFI,

Loans and Technical Assistance: During 1987, the
Bank approved a Joan of $3.3 million from ADF for the Urban
Cenlers Sewerage Project for which the Danish International
Development Agency (DANIDA} also provided grant cofinancing of $2.15 million, This compares wilh two loans
amounting to $8.8 million approved in 1986.

During the year, the Bank also approved two technical
assistance projects totalling $700 ,0U0 to help strengthen the
institutional capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and the
National Urban Develapment Corporation. To date, Bank
lending to Bhulan amounts to $28 million in six loans and
technical assistance amounts to $7.2 million for 21 projects.

Project Implementation: All six loans approved for
Bhutan are under administration, Disbursements amounted
to $3.2 million during 1987 compared with $1.5 million in
1986. Cumulative disbursements of Bank loans at the end
of 1987 amaunted to $6.3 million, or 18 per cent of the total
amount of effective loans.

Projects are now being implemented in a satisfactory manner, except for the Second Multiproject, which is running
behind schedule. In general, untamiliarity of government officials with the Bank's procedures and shortage of manpower
are Major constraints on project implementation. To alleviate
these constraints, the Hank has provided technical assistance
to key agencies involved in development adusinistration.

Prestressed Concrete Pipe Plant and fer Institutional
Strengthening for the Ministry of Energy. UNDP, with the
Bank acting as Executing Agency, also provided co-financing
to two technical assistance projects totalling $650,000,

As of the end of 1987, the Bank had provided 32 loans
to Burma totalling $530.9 million, including 30 loans totalling $524.3 million’ from ADF and two loans amounting to
$6.6 milllon from OCR. Tectinical assistance totalling $10.7
million had been provided for 38 projects of which 15 resulted
in Bank loans amounting to $386 9 million. The agriculture
sector accounted for about 60 per cent of total cumulative
Bank lending to Burma.

Project knplementation: Of the 32 loans approved for
Burma as of the end of 1987, 13 had been completely disbursed and 19 were under administration. One loan was
closed during 1987, Disbursements totalled $38 million in
1987 compared with $28 million in 1986. Cumulative

disbursements of Bank loans at the end of 1987 amounted
to $310.9 millon, or 56 per cent of the total amount of
effective loans.

Notwithstanding the overall difficult economic situation the
country Is facing, adequate attention was paid during the year
fo the itnplementation of Bank-assisted projects in Burma
Efforts made by senior government and executing agency
officials resulted in a disbursement level 35 per cent higher
than in 1986, However, lengthy government procedures and
tequirements applicable to precurement and the acute
shortage of local construction materials (diesel fuel, cement

Operational Strategy: Noting the economic transition
underway through reforms and adjustments of existing systems
in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), the Bank's operatonal strategy is aimed at supporting ongoing reforms through
a two-pronged approach, On the one hand, it has a basic focus
on the industry (including export-oriented agro-Industry) and
energy sectors with an eye on the infrastructure sector. On
the other hand, the Bank is also helping to improve the institutional capability of relevant government agencies. In the
PRC’s goal of attaining the status of a middle-income country by the turn of the century, both the Industry and energy
sectors have important roles to play. Yet both sectors have
a number of bottlenecks. The industry sector suffers from low
productivity, backward technology and growing product obsolescence. The energy sector is characterized by a high
energy/GNP ratio, inadequate power capacily generation and
inefficient transmission. The Bank's strategy in the industry
seclor is to support the Government's aim of industrial
modermization and in the energy sector is to promote energy
conservation, capacity addition and efficient transmission, The
Bank’s involvement in the infrastructure sector will be on a
selective basis and will alm at supporting the industry and
energy sectors.

To help the Government shift from its traditional role of
exercising direct administrative control over economic activities
to relying more on indirect macroeconomic instruments, the
Bank will also endeavor to strengthen the institutional capability of relevant government agencies, The aim Is to help the
agencies adjust to the new approaches of economic manage

a iment and to enable them to use effectively new
macroeconomic tools in addressing issues and evaluating
economic programs and policies. Geographically, Bank operations initially will focus on the country’s eastern region, which
is the country’s industrial and agricultural heartland,

Loans and Technical Assistance: The Bank began
lending to PRC in 1987 with two loans amounting to $133.3
million, The first loan, of $100 million to the China Investment Bank (CIB), is aimed at financing technologically
advanced machinery and equipment required for the modernization of medium-size and small-size industrial enterprises.
The second loan of $33.3 million for the Fuel Conversion
Project supports the Government's policy of swilching fuel for
power generation to coal from oil so that oil can be spared
for export earnings.

In 1987, the Bank also provided $1.4 million in technical
assistance for five projects. Of this, project preparatory
technical assistance amounted to $302,000 fer the Lai Wu
Iron and Steel Mill Modernization and Expansion Project and
the Hexian Pulp Mill Project. The remaining three advisory
and operational technical assistance, one each for CIB,
Huaneng Power Generation Corporation (HNPGC} and the
People’s Bank of China totalled $1.1 million and are aimed
at helping to strengthen their institutional capability. The
technical assistance for CIB and HNPGC totalling $750,000
were funded by UNDP and are administered by the Bank as
Executing Agency.

Project Implementation: The Bank's first two loans to
PRC are scheduled to become effective in early 1988. ‘fo lay
the groundwoyk for the implementation of these projects, officials from the executing agencies of these projects have visited
the Bank to familiarize themselves with the Bank's policies and
procedures. One official attended the 13th Regtonal Seminar
on Project Implementation Management held in November
1987. A briefing session for suppliers and contractors on the
Hank’s procurement procedures. was also held in PRC during the year.

Fiji

Operational Strategy: Whe Bank supports the Government's long-term objectives of economic growth and employment generation, This will be achieved by focusing Bank lend
ing and technical assistance activities on increasing productivity and diversifying the country’s economic base as well as
by developing supportive infrastructure. The Bank’s sirategy
also emphasizes increasing the rele of the private sector in
economic development. Sectorally, Bank assistance will be
directed at developing transportation: facilities and the energy
sector and lending to the private sector directly or indirectly
through development finance institutions. After the political
developments of 1987, Fiji's economy received a setback, The
Bank’s strategy will, therefore, also emphasize short-term
recovery. Accordingly, In the eneray sector, higher priority
will be accorded to power distribution projects in order to
facilitate the utilization of the available surplus hydropower.

Loans and Technical Assistance: Ne loans or technical
assistance were approved to Fiji in 1987, Cumulatively, as
of year-end, the Bank had approved eight loans amounting
to $60.5 million for eight projects. The energy sector accounted for about two-thirds of cumulative Bank lending to
the country, In additton, technical assistance totalling
$2.36 million was provided for 16 projects of which seven
were for project preparation and nine were advisory and
operational in nature,

India

Operational Strategy: The rapid indusitrialization of
India’s economy is one of the Governiment’s most important
objectives, and the Bank’s operational strategy is to assist in
this process. The Bank provides finance for projects aimed
at improving the structure of the Industrial sector, increasing
its share of GDP, export earnings and employment, and making more efficient use of productive capacity. Priority is given
to industries that can play a major role in the modernizalion
of the industrial sector and in stimulating growth in other sectors, with particular emphasis on the private sector. Bank
assistance is also aimed at the removal of bottlenecks to industrial development, especially in power, transportation and

Loans and Technical Assistance: Bank lending to
Indonesia totalled $576 million jn 1987, compared with
$319.1 million in 1986. Of the total, $441 million was fram
OCR and $135 million fro ADF, In recognition of the country's resource constraints, the Bank provided ADF financing
for the first time since mid-1979 for two blended loans, one
in the irrigation and one in the industries subsectors. The latter was the first program loan in Indonesia and the first program loan approved under the Bank's new program lending
policy. Overall, seven loans for five projects were approved
in 1987. Local cost financing accounted for $115.5 million,
and in two cases the Bank financed 80 per cent of total project cost. Two projecis involved co-financing amounting to
$47.5 millon from bilateral and commercial sources,

Sectorally, the industry and road subsectors accounted for
about 26 per cent each of Bank lending in 1987, followed
by 21 per cent for ircigation, 17 per cent for power and 10
per cent for development banks. ‘he policy-based program
loan for non-oil export promotion is aimed at supporting
Indonesia's efforts to enlarge and diversify non-oil exports and
regain balance of payments and budget stability in the con
text of the sleep decline in oil export earnings and structural

adjustment to longer-term resource depletion. The road project will provide for the maintenance of national and provincial roads and replacement of bridges in selected provirices,
and the irrigation (sector) loan will contribute to the further,
development of irrigation in three provinces, including the introduction of efficient operation and maintenance and institution building: The power sector loan will provide for the reinforcement and extension of power distribution systems in about
40 major towns outside Java to reduce high energy losses
and connect new consumers. The DFI loan will augment the
foreign exchange resources of the country’s largest development bank to meet credit requirements of industrial projects
in the private sector.

{In 1987, the Bank also approved $3.8 million in technical
assistance for 13 projects, including $300,000 co-financing

nine projects in 1986, Project preparatory technical assistance
totalled $2.4 million for eight projects, and advisory and
operalional technical assistance amounted to $1.3 million for
five projects, Seven of the projects were in the agriculturat
sector, two each in the transport and financial sectors, and
one each in educatton and health and population, One
technical assistance was co-financed under cost-sharing
arrangements by a non-governmental organization, the Ford
Foundation, for the amount of $300,000.

As of the end of 1987, the Bank had approved 125 lnans

country’s development plans, with agriculture accounting for
more than 37 per cent of cumulative Bank lending, followed
by soclal infrastructure (19 per cent}, transport and communications (18 per cent) and energy (17 per cent).

Project Implementation: Of the 125 loans made io
Indonesia, 59 had been closed and 66 were under administrahon at the end of 1987 of which six were awaiting effectivity.
Twelve loans were closed during 1987. Dishursements totalled
$352.4 million during the year compared with $206.7 million
in 1986, Cumulative disbursements of Bank loans at the end
of the year amounted to $1,508.8 million, or 42 per cent of
the total arnount of effective loans.

Project implementation during the year registered significant improvements, Three special financing facilities approved
by the Bank in 1986 to assist the Government in overcoming
local fund constraints had their positive impact on project implermentation during the year. Further, the Special Team,
established in BAPPENAS (Central Planning Agency) under
the chairmanship of the Minister for Administrative Reforms
in the middle of 1986, made strong efforts to speed up proj
ect implementation, In.addition, measures undertaken by the

Republic of Korea in 1987 consisted of one advisory technical
assistance giant of $350,000 to help set up a Road Safety
Program and prepare a Highway Capacity Manual.

By the end of 1987, the Bank had extended 77 loans totalling $2,202.7 million to the Republic of Korea Of these, 76
loans totalling $2,199 million were frorn OCR and one loan

equity investments and provided one line of equity totalling
$9.19 million. The Bank had also provided 32 technical
assistance grants lotalling $4.7 millicn. Of these, six were for
advisory and operational purposes (51.8 million} and 26 for
the preparation of projects ($2.9 million), 21 of which have
resulted in 24 Bank loans amounting to $872.4 million. Of
the Bank's total lending to the Republic of Korea, two thirds
has been in sectors directly supporting the country’s
industrialization efforts .- industry, development banks,
energy and transport. In recent years, the Government has
increased investment in the social infrastructure sector, This
change in emphasis is reflected in the Bank's lending since
1977, during which perlod about one third of its assistance
has been for social infrastructure. The major objective of this
assistance has been to support the efforts of the Government
to improve living conditions in provincial and rural areas and
thus promote balanced regtonal development. There has also
been a tise in Bank lending to the energy sector to assist the
country reduce its dependence on Imported oil.

Lao PDR

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational strategy
in Lao PDR Is atrned at developing the country’s baste
infrastructure in order to achieve better integration of the
economy and to stimulate production and trade. It is also
aimed at increasing foreign exchange earnings through the
development of the country’s more promising exports and/orthrough the support of viable import-substitution activities, To
achieve these objectives, Bank assistance is channelled
towards developing read transport, hydropower resources,
power transmission and distribution, and forestry and wood
processing

Loans and Technical Avsistance: In 1987, the Bank
approved two loans from ADF amounting te $34.5 million
for two projects in Lao PDR. One loan, for $15.5 million,
was for the Xeset Hydropower Project which involves a 45
MW run-of-river power station on the Xeset river for domestic
electrification and for export of electrical energy to Thailand.
This project was co financed, on a grant basis, by the Swedish
International Development Authority (SIDA) and UNDP in
the amount of $17 million equivalent and $1.8 million, respectively. A second loan in the amount of $19 million was for
the Third Road Improvernent Project which covers the
rehabilitation and improvement of a 162-km road stretch from
the capital of Vientiane to Vang Vieng. UNDP provided grant
co-financing in the amount of $1 milllon with the Bank acting as Executing Agency.

Southern Roads Improveitient Project and the other for road
maintenance training,

To date the Bank has provided 15 loans for 14 projects
amounting ta $106.6 million to Lao PDR, all from ADF.
Technical assistance totalling $11.8 million has been provided
for 30 projects, of which 11 have resulted in Bank loans
amounting to $101.9 million. The sectoral distribution of

Loans and Technical Assistance; Bank lending to
Malaysia in 1987 arnounted to $82.3 milllon from OCR for
twa projects, compared with $105.2 million for two projects
in 1986, One loan was in the education sector for the expansion of vocational training and the other loan was for fisheries
research and development.

Four tectinical assistance gratits totalling $994,000 were approved in 1987, compared with five amounting to $1.2 million
in 1986. Advisory and operational technical assistance totalled
$319,000 for one project in the energy sector.

As of the end of 1987, the Bank had approved 63 loans
for 61 projects tolalling $1,364.9 million. All but one loan
fof $3.3 million) were fram OCK. In addition, technical
assistance totalling $8.4 million had been provided for 38 projects, of which 11 resulted in Bank loans amounting to
$349.6 million. The sectoral distribution of cumulative Bank
lending to Malaysia reflects both the emphasis on physical
infrastructure in less develuped areas and the mere recent
thrust towards agriculture and social infrastructure
development.Project Implementation: At the end of 1987, of the 63
loans approved to Malaysia, 41 loans had been completely
disbursed, of which two loans were closed in 1987, Twentytwo loans were under administration, three of which are
awaiting effectivity. Disbursements in 1987 totalled $49 million
as compared with $40.7 million in 1986. Cumulative
disbursements at the end of the year amounted to
$599.3 million, which is 62 per cent of the total amount of
effective loans.

Most of the ongving Projects are progressing satisfactorily.
However,in some cases, loan disbursement has been lagging
far behind physical progress. Cancellation of loan amounts
in six projects totalling $49 million has been requested due
to contract prices that were lower than previously estimated
and also because of changes in project scope.

Maldives

Operational Strategy: Ihe Bank's assistance program
in Maldives has focused on power, transport and communications to support the clirectly productive investments made by

from ADF, compared to $51.2 million for three foans in 1986,
All four loans approved in 1987 were in the agriculture seetor, These projects were designed to provide agricultural credit;
to produce paper by using locally available raw materials; to
enhance farm income through promating fruit cultivation in
the Hills; and to increase foodgrain production by constructing irrigation facilities in the Terai.

The Bank also approved eight technical assistance projects
amounting to $4.5 million. Four of these involved UNDPTRADITIONAL methods are used to build a modern airport
terminal in Nepal. The Bank has supported the Tribhuvan international Airport Project with four leans totalling $37.26

Institution Bulding of the Agricultural Development Bank of
Nepal and Improving Government Financial Accounting and
Auditing Procedures, were co-financed by UNDP and the
Bank. The Government of Switzerland provided $100,000
in co-financing with the Bank for the preparation of a Secondary Crops Development Project. In addition to these cofinanced technical assistance projects, the Kank provided funds
to prepare the second water supply sector loan and to assist
the Government in carrying out key studies on irrigation service fees and cost recovery, and on the teacher education
sector.

As of end-December 1987, ihe Bank had approved 55

with $35.5 million in 1986, Cumulative disbursements of
Bank loans at the end of the year totalled $258.4 million or
40.6 per cent of the total amount of effective loans.

Project implementation in Nepal is generaily slow and
disbursements declined in 1987 for the second consecutive
year. Among the problems affecting projects in Nepal are slow
Telease of budgeted funds, delays in recruitment of consultants
and procurement of goods and services and a shortage of adequataly trained staff, However, In spite of these problems some
projects progressed satisfactorily in 1987. The Government
has taken a number of steps to improve project implementation, including development of a computerized program
budgeting and project monitoring system, establishment of
more clear-cut project priorities and improved donor coordination, At the request of the Government, the Bank conducted semi-annual Country Projects Review Meetings

preceding years. High-level dialogue with the Government
on cross-sectoral project implementation Jssues and constraints
as well as on project-specific implementation problems, continued within the institutional mechanism of semi-annual
Country Projects Review Meetings (CPRMs) and the same
proved to be productive as well as effective. The Government
continued to attach great importance to the mechanism of
CPRM and expressed satisfaction at the results it has so far
achieved.

The Government's positive attitude in taking remedial actions to resolve implementation problems characterized the
year's project implementation expertence in Pakislan.

Project Implementation; Of the 83 joans approved for
the Philippines (including one Special Assistance loan and two
Special Project Implementation Assistance loans}, 43 had been
completely disbursed and 40 were under administration, including une that is awaiting effectivity. Eight loans were closed
during the year. Disbursements totalled $133 million during
1987 compared with $138.6 million in 1986. Cumulatiwe
disbursements of Bank foans at the end of 1987 totalled
$1,375.7 million, or 65.4 per cent of the total amount of
effective loans.

As in recent years, one of the major problems in project
implementation in the Philippines has been the shorlaye of
local currency funding due to budgetary constraints, In order
to make up for these constraints, the second tranche of
$17 million and the third tranche of $10.9 millicn under the
two Special Project Inplementation Assistance loans which
were approved In 1986 were released in January and August,
respectively. As a result of close monitoring and extensive
dialogue conducted by the Bank and the Government, more
than 98 per cent of the funds released was utilized by the end
of November 1987. Consequently, the fourth and final tranche
amounting to $26 million was released in Decernber 1987,
thus completing the disbursement of the SPIA loans, The SPIA
loans facilitated completion of 12 ongoing projects by the end
of 1987 and four more projects are expected te be completed
by 30 June 1988.

A number of measures have been taken at the Bank’s initialive to solve other problems in project implementation, including establishing imprest accounts, increasing disbursernent
percentages under Bank loans and clarifying procedures for
calculating escalation payments in civil works contracts. Procedures delegating greater authority to approve contracts to
line ministries and public corporations have also been adopted.
However, a number of factors affecting project implementation still persist such as cumbersome contract auditing procedures which result in delays in procurarnent, difficulties in
securing rights-of-way and security-related problems in certain regions.

Sri Lanka

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational strategy
in Sri Lanka is designed to help reverse the trend towards
deterioration of capital assets, seek institutional and policy
development in sectors where these inadequacies constitute
a constraint to development and give priority to certain struciural adjustments needed in the economy. Important underly
ing themes of the Bank’s operational strategy are assistance
for private sector and export development. Through its iending and technical assistance program, the Bank will also seek
to address financial and industrial policy constraints on private
sector industrial development. Concomitantly, the Government's development strategy {s dependent on increasing expart eamings, and export promotion or efficient import

substitution constitute important components of a number of
the Bank’s pipeline projects.

Luans and Techical Assistance: In 1987, the Bank
approved four loans totalling $106.3 million from. ADE to
Sri Lanka, compared with four loans for $102.3 iillion In
1986. Local cost financing atnounted to $17.2 million (about
16 per cent) of Bank lending to Sri Lanka in 1987 for three
projects. A DF loan also provides for Bank financing of a small
Proportion of local costs.

other loans will rehabilitate facilities and improve institutions
in the power distribution and roads sectors in the central and
southern provinces, A fourth will provide term finance for small
and medium industries through financial intermediaries.

In addition, the Bank provided two technical assistance
grants for the preparation of a smallhalder tea project and a
third road project. The Bank approved five advisory and
operational technical assistance grants for a rural credit review,
a fisheries sector study, a study of irrigation management and
crop diversification, support for the AdminIstrative Keforms
Committee and an institutional strategy study for the Lanka
Electricity Cormpany, The technical assistance provided by the
Bank [excluding $84,000 under a cost-sharing arrangement
with the International Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI)
and $416,500 by the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAQ)] totalled $1.3 million.

As of the end of 1987, the Bank had provided 48 loans
including a Special Assistance loan) amounting to
$674.8 million for 42 projects in the country. Of these, six
loans totalling $14.1 million were from OCR and 42 loans
amounting to $660.6 million were from ADF. Technical
assistance totalling $9.7 millon (including $2.6 million
financed by the Government of Switzerland, EEC and UNDP}
had been approved for 54 projects, of which 24 had resulted
in Bank loans amouailng to $432 million, The agriculture and
agre-industry sector had accounted for 53 per cent of
cumulative Bank lending to Sr! Lanka

occur in the agriculture and agro-industry sector, particularly
fisheries and forestry. Two Country Projects Review Meetings
were held in 1987 to discuss project implementation problems
at the highest administrative level. Appropriate remedial
measures are being considered for adoption.

Thailand

Operational Strategy: Based on the Operational
Strategy Study for Thailand, initiated and largely completed
during the year, the Bank is expected to continue to stress
support for the Government's Sixth National Economic and
Social Development Plan (1987-1991), with the braad objectives of achieving structural adjustments required for attain-AMANGANESE refinery in Ratchaburt, Thailand, part of a private sector operation being assisted under a Bank tine of credit

to the Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand (IFCT) for relending to medium industries. The Bank has extended six

credit lines totalling $140 million te LFCT,

ing higher economic growth in the context of public sector
raform and changes in economic policy, including deregulaon and the further liberalization of the economy. Thus, given
the critical role of the energy sector in the Government's industrialization program, Bank operations will continue to improve the country’s power base, with Increasing emphasis on
distribution to ensure maximum utilization of the existing
generating capacity, Similarly, basic infrastructure, such as
transport and communications, has been identified as a crucial
area for the growing Industrial sector, and the Bank will examine opportunities to assist in alleviating constraints in those
sectors. In the agriculture sector, Bank operations expect to
reflect the Government's growing concern about the promotion of agricultural diversification and the strengthening of agrobusiness, with particular attention te the lead role envisaged
for the private sector and the development of export opportunities, In industry, Bank private sector operations will further pursue opportunities for direct equity investment and
lending without government guarantee. In the social infrastructure sector, Bank assistance will be oriented toward projects
aimed at developing and Improving urban infrastructure both
In the provinces and in metropolitan Bangkok, with particular
relerence to water supply.

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1987, Thailand
did not borrow tram the Bank for the first time since the beginning of Bank operations. This was due primarily to a combination of the increasing availability of both concessional
bilateral funds and commercial financing and the Governmen’s debt management policy on external borrowings.

However, the Bank did pravide seven technical assistance
grants, Technical assistance was provided to the Department
of Highways for the preparation of a Joan project tentatively
scheduled for 1988. The Bank also approved supplementary
financing for a previously approved technical assistance for
the Agricultural Development Information Program. Advisory
and operational technical assistance were provided to the

echnical assistance totalling $11.6 million had been provided for 51 projects, of which 10 have resulted in 11 Bank loans
amounting to $344.6 million. The energy sector accounted
for 46.7 per cent of cumulative lending to Thailand followed
by the transport and communications sector with 16.3 per

disbursements of Bank loans at the end of 1987 amounted
to $1,056.4 million, or 77 per cent of the total amount of
effective loans.

Generally, Bank-assisted projects in Thailand are being implemented satisfactorily and, where problems appear, remedial
measures are immediately taken by executing agencies. The
high degree of professionalism and the extensive experience
of local staff have helped minimize mistakes in project implementation. There was alsu close and effective interaction
between Bank staff and projects staff during project administration missions.

Since its establishment in 1984, the South Pacific Regional
Office (SPRO) has assumed responsibility in formulating the
Bank's operational strategy for Cook Islands, Karibati, Solomon
Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu and preparing county programs
for them. SPRO has also administered DFI loans for most of
the smaller SPOMCs and several projects in other sectors

Loans and Technical Assistance: in 1987, the Bank
approved two port project loans to Solomon Islands and
Vanuatu, one fisheries loan to Solomon Islands and one
multiproject loan to Cook Islands. The four isans amounted
to $17.8 million from ADF. The loans to Solomon dslands
wil provide for improvements to the fishing fleet, the construction of a cold storage facility for the National Fisheries
Company and upgrading of the overseas wharf at Honiara
Port. The loan to Vanuatu will provide for the construction
of a uew wharf and ancillary facllities at Santo Port. The

Project Administration

IN 1987, project administration was geared toward helping
executing agencies expedite and improve the implementation
of projects. This was done by taking prompt action on matters
that were subinitted to the Bank for review and approval; by
close monitoring of the status and progress of individual projects, both within the Bank and in the field: by conducting
policy dialogues with senior level government officials on broad
implernentation problems and issues in selected DMCs; and
by conducting training programs for projects staff in various
aspects of implementation activities,

Improved project administration, which was reflected in a
speedier processing of implementation matters requiring Bank
decisions, has been achieved through the efficient {unctioning of the Project Administration Units in the Agriculture and
Infrastructure Departments and the corresponding project ad
ministration organization in the Industry and Development
Banks Department and the reorganization of the Agriculture
Departments on a regional basis which has Promoted a more
country-specific approach to project administration, It was the
result of greater and more effective collaboration between
departments /offices involved In project administration. There
was also an increased delegation of authority given to project
Managers with respect to procurement cases, thereby cutting
the time required for approving drafl prequalification and
tender documents, prequalification of contractors and award
of contacts, To strengthen the project adininistration
capabllities of Bank staff, seminars on procurement operations
and engagement of consuliants were conducted: handbooks
entitled “Guide to Iank Staff on the Engagement of Consultants” and “Guide on Pre-Qualification of Civil Works Contractors” were distributed; revised project administration instructions were issued; the Loan and Financial Information
System was expanded to meet new requirements; and work
was started on the revision of the Project Administration
Manual and Handbook on Procurement,

Efficient inonitoring of individual projects was reinforced
by the monthly and quarterly Project Administration Committee meetings. In these meetings, Management and Bank
staff analyzed project performance in terms of physical ae
 

complishments and other indicators, revlewed the classification of projects and identified problems and issues in the socalled unsatisfactory projects, and formulated appropriate
measures fo improve project implementation and administration. These internal actions were supplemented by project ad
ministration missions carried out in the field, of which there.

were 408 in 1987 covering 530 projects. The increased emphasis on project supervision is reflected in the higher number
of missions devoted for this purpose in 1987 as compared
to the 354 missions in 1986. The establishment of an
Indonesia Resident Office (IRO) in Jakarta was also a significart step In improving implementation in a major borrowing
country. Like the Bangladesh Resident Office and the South
Pacific Regional Office, RO plays an important role in providing supplementary on-site support to the project supervision work of the Project Divisions in the Bank.

Within the framework of the Country Project Review
Meetings, which were started in 1983, policy dialogues were
conducted during the year with the Governments of
Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan and Sn Lanka. These
meetings dealt with project implementation problems and constraints which were common to a larye number of projects
in the countries concerned such as shortage of local counter.
part funds, bureaucratic procedures and requirements, government regulations that are in conflict with the Bank’s guidelines
and a lack of coordination among ministries ‘departments or
other agencies involved in implementation. Other problems
encountered were delays in Inan effectiveness, low demand
for subloans under DFI arid agricultural credits, failure to comply with financial covenants, institutional and managerial bottlenecks and technical problems. The importance vf these
policy dialogues was widely acknowledged by the governments concerned and steps have already been taken to implement some of the measures that have been proposed in
such meetings.

Training continued to be an important element of the Bank’s
Programa to develop skills in project implementation. In order
to upgrade the management capabilities of project managers,
three regional seminars on project implementation manage
ment, organized on a sectoral basis, were conducted in 1987.
in addition, five country seminars on procurement and five
on uses of consultants were held in Malaysta, Nepal, Pakistan,

knowledge and skills of projects staff in procuring goods and

contracts were also made available to executing agencies.

Another important aspect of the learning process was the
assistance given to suppliers and consultants in broadening
their participation in international competition. This was done
through the business opportunities and procurement information seminars conducted in Belgium, People’s Republic of
China, Denmark, [taly, Netherlands, Thailand, United
Kingdom ard United States as well as through seminars on
development of domestic consultants conducted in India,
Malaysia and Thailand. Briefings were also held for consultants, trade missions and other business-oriented groups
that visited the Bank.

There were 60 consulting firms and 29 individual consultants engaged by barrowers for loan-financed projects while
§3 consulting firms and 171 individual consultants were
employed by the Bank for technical assistance projects. The
net value of procurement cortracts awarded for all projects
amounted to $1,440.1 million in 1987, of which
$869.8 million was against ordinary capital resources (OCR)
loans and $570.3 million against loans under the Asian
Development Fund (ADF). This brought cumulative precurement to $10,883,2 million or 61 per cent of effective leans.

Loan Disbursements

Laan disbursements in 1987 totalled $1,232 million, an increase of 20 per cent from the near-stagnant levels of the
previous thrée years,

Ordinary capital resources loan disbursemnenls rose by
13 per cent to $693 million from $612 million in 1986, revers
ing the trend of recent years. The establishment of the IRQ,
well-coordinated project implementation by the Government
af Indonesia (including the operations of a Specia! Team in
BAPPENAS, the Central Planning Agency), the timely utilizalion of special financing facilities for Bank-assisted projects In
Indonesia and the Philippines, sustamed moniloring of projects implementation and project/sector-specific implementa
tion performances in Pakistan were among the factors which
contributed to better OCR disbursement.

Disbursements under ADF loans increased by 31 per cent
to $639 million from $412 raillion in 1986. The increase, in
line with a trend since 1983, resulted from improved project
implementation performance in Bangladesh and Pakistan and
was also alded by the types and sectors of financing provided
to ADF-eligible borrowers,

To faster better appreciation of its disbursement procedures
and practices among DMC officials involved in project im
plementation, the Bank in 1987 conducted a number of
seminars and workshops in several DMCs, In addition, the
Bank continued to allow increasing use of special disbursement procedures such as Statements of Expenditures and

Imprest Accounts to facilitate improved flow of funds to the
IMCs.

Projects Completed

Tifty-twe projects were completed in 1987, bringing the total
number completed to 389 or 49 pat cent of the 793 projects
approved as of 31 December 19%7. Compared with 1986,
when 36 projects were completed, project completion rose
significantly in 1987 reflecting itnproved project administration by the Bank ancl improved implementation performance
on the part of executing agencies. Examples of projects successfully completed in 1987 are the Tulungaguna Drainage
Project in Indonesia, the Vocational Education Project in
Malaysia, the Fourth Power Project in Nepal and the Fifth Industrial Finance Corporation Project in Thailand.

Forty-two Project Completion Reports (PCRs) were completed in 1987. As of the end af 1987, a total of 277 PCRs
had been circulaled to the Board of Directors.

Project Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation

During 1987, the Bank’s project benefit monitoring and
evaluation (PBME) program continued along previouslyestablished lines. An Operations Manual Section, issued in
March 1987, presented a clear description of the scope, purpose and general procedures for all sectars where PBME is
applied. A technicul manual for projects in the Irrigation sec-work in the Philippines (right).

tor was issued in July and drafts of similar manuals were
prepared for the water supply and roads and highways sectors,

Benchmiark information about beneficiaries was prepared
and used during the preparation of feasibility studies for about
one-third of the projects appraised by ihe Agriculture Departments during 1987. Also, benchmark information which contains a social and institutional profile of beneficiary groups is
now commonly used as a data base for increasing the participation of these groups in implementing irrigation projects.
At the end of 1987, benchmark information which could help
i) preparing impact evaluations of completed projects had
been or was being prepared for 110 out of 132 ongoing projects belny administered by the Agriculture Departments and
the Infrastruclure Department.

type of project benefit monitoring were also included in the
Second On Farm Water Management Project in Pakistan.
Such monitoring systems can provide long-term benefits by
enabling the agency to improve the operation of facllities constructed with assistance fram project loans. However, the
establishment of these systems is a long-term proposition (at
least five years) and their development needs to be integrated
with the development/upgrading of procedures used by the

‘agency to manage ils operations.

Concerned projects divisions are now better equipped to

THE success of development management depends not only on how well projects are prepared and implemented but
also on how well the steps of the project cycle are integrated
through the process of post-evaluation, An important part of
the Bank's work, therefore, is its evaluation system which provides for learning from experience. Post-evaluation aims to
Provide a systematic, comprehensive and independent review
of Bank operations, As well as helping improve the design
and conduct of fitture Bank activities, post-evaluation enables
the Bank to account to member governments for the effectiveness of its assistance. The evaluation function In the Bank
is the responsibility of the Post-Evaluation Office {PEO}, which
reports directly to the President. ~

During 1987, 38 Project Performance Audit Reports
{PPARs} covering the experience of 40 projects {including four
program loans) were circulated, raising the total number of
PPARs prepared to date to 238 (covering 252 projects), Most
of the 40 audited projects were appraised in the 1970s and
all but ong were approved between 1971 and 1981. About
23 per cent of these projects were completed between 1984
and 1986. In total, they represent some $958 million in Bank
loans and nearly $2.5 billion in overall Investment.

In terms of country grouping, 42 per cent of the projects
audited (or 17) were in Group A, 33 per cent in Group B
and the remaining 25 per cent in Group C countries. In terms
of sector grouping, 35 per cent (or 14) were in agriculture,
60 per cent in infrastructure, and 5 per cent in the developToent finance institition (DFI) sector. The uneven spread
reflects the pattern of project completion. The 24 infrastructure projects audited in 1987 Include nine in the energy sector, five in water supply, four in transport and communications, four in education and two in urban development. The
share of projects audited in Group B countries more than
doubled to 52 per cent in 1987 from 24 per cent in 1986,
the share of Group A countries fell to 23 per cent from 42
per cent and that of Group C countries declined ta 25 per
cent from 34 per cent in the same period.

In terms of overall results, the performance of this year’s
group of projects shows that 20 projects or 50 per cent were
assessed at the time of post-evaluation as being generally successful in meeting their main objectives while 17 projects or
43 per cent were assessed as partly successful and 7 per cent

 

as \msuccessful. This compares with 67 per cent assessed as
successfisl and 33 per cent as partly successful in 1986, The
decrease in the proportion of generally and parily successful
projects is due mainly to the larger number of projects directly producing primary commodities or indirectly saving energy
which were audited during 1987, many of which were
adversely affected by the decline in primary commodity prices
in world markets.

FISHING trawlers ii Burrna, The Bank has approved loans totalling $83.7 million for marine fisheries development through
rehabilitating and expanding the country's fishing fleet and improving its fishing gear and infrastructure facilities

The successful projects are fairly evenly distributed by country group with 47 per cent in Group A, 54 per cent Group
8 and 50 per cent Group C. However, by sector, development bank projects were the most successful this year with
100 per cenl, compared with 50 per cent for agriculture and
46 per cent for infrastructure. Twelve of the partly successful
Projects and one of the unsuccessful projects were in the in
frastructure sector with the remaining five partly successful and
two unsuccessful projects being in agriculture.

The unfavorable external and internal economic environmet of the early 1980s explains to a considerable extent the
relatively large nurnber of projects with less than satisfactory
outcomes. Other factors contributing to project performance
include deficlencies in project design, institutional and administrative construints among many borrowers and distortlons in sectoral and economy whe policies, The adjustments
to development priorities and therefore to budgetary alloca
tions which many countries had to make, due to varlous external factors, particularly the decline in commodity prices,
was also a contributing factor. Such adjustment measures also

hacl implications for the timely completion of development
projects which were under implementation.

To date, the Bank has post-evaluated six program loans
totalling $270 million in actual total investment. Of the four
program loans post-evaluated this year, the largest was the
Agricultural Inputs Program in the Philippines of $130 million
which accounted for nearly half of the total of all program
loans. Five of the six program loans were made to Group A
countries, with Burma being a three-time recipient, and one
to a Group B country. All but one — the Petroleum Refining
Industry Program (Burma) for $5 million — were successful,
The successful programs were all aimed at crop intensification and funded more ihan 730,000 mt of fertilizer to increase
farm production and crop yields. Experience from these programs provides further evidence of the importance of adequately addressing pertinent sector and operational issues during program formulation and close monitoring of program
design, progress and related developments during
implementation,

Since 1982 PEO has undertaken intenslve analysis of par-ticular issues on subjects of broader relevance te the Bank’s
operations, practices and procedures than are frequently raised
by PPARs. These studies are of two main types: Special
Studies and Impact Evaluation Studies.

A Study on Compliance with Special Loan Covenants was
completed and an Impact Evaluation Study on DFI Lending
to Small-Scale and Medium-Seale Industry (SMI) Development in the Republic of Korea was also undertaken and completed during 1987.

The Study on Compliance with Special Loan Covenants
drew on findings from 176 completed projects audited up to
the end of 1985, The Study recommended: (i) a more selective use of special covenants; {ii) improvements tn project
preparation and design Including the formulation of covenants;
and (ii) encouraging more active borrowet-Bank dialogue.
In addition, certain administrative steps could also be considered to facilitate better manitoting and tmely action in cases
of non-compliance with covenants,

The Impact Evaluation Study on DF! Lending to SmailScale and Medium-Scale industry Develonment in the
Republic of Korea identified a number of important findings
which would also be of relevance to DF] lending to the SMI
sector in other DMCs. These include: (i) attainment of greater
operational autonamy by the Fs; (ti) delegation of authortty to, and expansion of, DF] branches to enhance resource
mobilization and subprojecl processing and supervision; (ii)
initiation of a thorough credit rating system with emphasis on
the subborrower's management capability which has proved
to be an effective instrument in overcoming the difficulties

genetally associated with market analysis in the SMI sector;
and {iv) increased involvement of research organizations for
technology development of SMIs.

The Ninth Review of Post-Evaluation Reports and Sixth
Report of Selected Post-Evaluation Findings — summarizing
and listing, respectively, ihe results of post-evaluation studies
made during 1986 — were circulated to the Board of Directors in February and April 1987, before the Bank's Annual
Meeting.

The PEO continues to be closely associated with processing activities for new loans and technical assistance projects,
so that the experience and findings from audited projects can
be taken fully into account in the formulation of new projects
Toward this end, PEO's computerized data base for postevaluation findings was further expanded and improved duriag
the year. Nineteen country reports, summarizing audit findings in individual countries, were circulated to the operational
departments as part of the measures to improve dissernination of-such information within the Bank.

The Bank Management and the Audit Committee of the
Board continue to monitor closely the post-evaluation process, particularly to ensure that lessons learned from the ex:
perience of completed projects ave properly taken into account
in the design of new projects and during the implementation
of ongoing projects. The Audit Committee reviewed a number
of selected Project Completion Reports (PCRs) and PPARs
during the year, as well as PEO's Ninth Annual Review of
Post-Evaluation Reports. The Committee was satisfied with
the conduct of post-evaluation activities.& ‘ Fi

AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Financial Policies

TUE review of the Bank’s financlal policies, started by the
Board of Directors in 1986, was continued in 1987, In the
Teview, the Board undertook a series of studies on the Bank's
income and liquidity policies and its loan charges. The findings of the studies were approved by the Board in September
In accordance with these findings, the Bank will continue to
inainlain the adequacy of tts net income by ensuring that its
interest-coverage ralio does not fall substantially below 1,25
in the long run, while the minimutn target for the Bank’s
reserve;loan ratio will be set within the range of 20 per cent
to 25 per cent. In setting the targets for these indicators, the
Bank will ensure that such targets would not result in a perceptible basic negative trend in the Bank's long termi net income.

As regards the Bank’s loan charges, the Board approved
certain reductions which will provide significant cost savings
to borrowing mamber countries. The variable spread, which
is added to the average cost of a pool of Bank borrowings
in determining the pool-based variable lending rate, was
reduced from 0.50 per cent per annuin to 0.40 per cent per
annum, effective 1 January 1988, There was also a change
in the method fur computing the commitment charge on new
loans. Before the change, the commitment charge of 0.75
per cent per annum was levied on the full undisbursed balance
of the loan, Under the new method, however, far loans
approved on or after 1 duly 1987, the commitment charge,
which was retained at U.75 per cent per annum, is levied on
the following increasing portions of the loan amount (less
curnulative disbursements); 15 per cent in the first year, 45
per cent in the second year, 85 per cert in the third year and
100 per cent in the fourth year and beyond. This change is
effectively equivalent to a stralght reduction in the commitment charge from 0.76 per cent per annum to 0.50 per cent
per annum. In making these reductions in the Bank's loan
charges, the Board sought to balance the interests of borrowers
with the requirement lo preserve and protect the Bank's essential financial ratios

Variable Lending Rate

The Bank's variable lending rate was reduced twice during
the year reflecting the relatively low cost of funds borrowed
in 1986 and 1987, the apprecialion of major currencles against
the US dollar and the effect of the Bank’s liability management program, The rate, which had heen set at 7.65 per cent
per annum on 1 July 1986 when the variable lending rate
system came into operation, was reduced on 1 January 1987
to 7.36 per cent per annum for the first half of 1987, and
was further reduced on 1 July 1987 to 7.03 per cent per an
num for the second half of the year.)

Borrowings

‘The Bank made five borrowings in 1987 equivalent in total
to $537 million, Details of the year's borrowings are shown
in the table on page 170.

in response to a larger-than-expected rise in liquidity during the year, brought about mainly by increased loan
prepayments and cancellations and the appreciation of major currencies against the US dollar, some borrowings originally
included in the 1987 borrowing proyram were not undertaken.
In addition, the amount prepaid under the Bank's liability
management program was increased to $797 million. Consequently, the 1987 borrowing and liability management programs had the combined effect of reducing liquidity by $260
ruiflion.

In view of the cutback In the borrowing program, the Bank
undertcok only one borrowing {a public bond issue) in each
of the German, saan mn Swiss capital markets. The bond

issue in the Federal Republic of Gerrnany, in Novernber, was
for DM200 million, that in Japan, in lebruary, was for ¥ 30
billion, and that in Switzerland, also in February, was for
SwF150 million,

A public offering of £50 million was made in the Euro
sterling market in June. This was the Bank's first borrowing
in that market. Proceeds of the issue were swapped into yen.

In May, the Bank entered into an agreement for a private
placement of Kuwalti dinar bands amounting to KD11.5
million. The proceeds of the borrowing were used for refund:
ing an earlier issue in Kuwaiti dinars which was prepald,

The average maturity of the year's borrowings, weighted
by amount, was 10.93 years compared with the average
maturity in 1986 of 14.40 years, At the end of 1987, the
average life of outstanding borrowings was 7.88 years. After
swaps, the average cost of the 1987 borrawings, weighted
by the amount of each borrowing, was 5.63 per cent per
annum

The capital stock ts deflned in the Bank's Articles of Agreetment in terms of United States dollars of the weight and
fineness in effect on 31 January 1966, Since the coming into
effect of the Second Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the Intertiational Monetary Fund (IMF) on 1 April
1978, currencies no longer have par values in terms of gold
Pending the Bank's selection of the appropriate successor to
the 1966 dollar, the value of the Bank’s capital stock has been
expressed in terms of the SDR on the basis that each share
has the value of SDR10,000. The mutual obligations of each
member and the Bank with respect to maintenance of value
of currency holdings have also been measured by the same
standard, but settlement of such obligations has been held in
abeyance, For purposes of the financial statements, the SDR
has been translated into current United States dollars at the
rate computed by the IMF, As of 31 December 1987, the raie

was $1,41866 per SDR, Further information on the Bank's *

currerit practice regard}ng valuation of capital and maintenance
of value is given in Notes A and F of the Notes to Financial
Statements of Ordinary Capital Resources, OCR-7.

During 1987, Bank staff began a fresh examination of the
question of the future valuation of the Bank’s capital and the
telated question of maintenance of value obligations. Al yearend It was anticipated that the results of thls examination,
which would take into account the decision reached cn similar
questions at the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD), would be submitted to the Board of
Directors in about March or April 1988,

The third general capital increase (GCI Ul), approved by
Govemors’ Resolution No. 158 in April 1983, consisted of
an additional 754,750 shares In the Bank’s authorized capital
stock. At the 31 December 1987 exchange rate of $1.41866
per SDR, the total aincunt authorized was $10.707.3 million
(SDR7,547.5 million). By 31 May 1986, the extended final
date for subscription, GCI Ill subscriptions had been made
by a total of 39 inember countries. The total amount subscribed (at the 31 December 1987 exchange rates) was
$10,490. 1 million (SDR7,394,4 million). At the end of 1987,
the United States’ payments for both its fifth instalment and
the shortfall in its third instalment were still awaited.

Resolution No, 174, authorized by the Board of Governors
in September 1985, provided for an additional 29,520 shares
to be made available for special Incteases in the capital
subscriptions (SCls) of Finland, France, ltaly, Netherlands and
Switzerland. During the first quarter of 1987, ihe SCls of Italy
and the Netherlands totalling $181.4 million (SDR127.9
million) became effective, Consequently, by 31 March 1987,
the extended final clate for subscription, all five member countries authorized for SCls under the Resolution had subscribed
to their entitlements. ‘

At the end of 1987, the Bank's authorized capital stock
amounted to $22,986.9 million (SDR16,203.3 million), The
subscribed capital stock stood at $22,769.7 million

Future Resource Requirements

In May 1986, the Board of Governors, recognizing the need
for a study of the Bank's future resource requirements to
finance its ordinary operations, adopted Resolution No. 179
requesting the Board of Directors to undertake such a study
and to report its findings and recommendations to the Board
of Governors for consideralion and-action. A report review

‘Twentieth Annual Meeting. Proposed papers referred to in
the report, on the Bank’s net incoine targets and the possible
scope for reductions in its loan charges and on its projected
OCK operations during the perlod 1987-95, were considered
by the Board of Directors in 1987. A furtlier report of the
Board of Directors on progress of the study has been submitted to the Board of Governors for consideration at the TwentyFirst Annual Meeting, and a number of working papers on
related matters will be considered by the Board of Directors
during 1988.

Investments

At the end of 1987, the Bank’s OCR investments were
denorninated in 22 currencies and amounted to the equivalent
af $4,618 million ($4,170 million at the end of 1986). Of the
total Investments, 59 per cent (83 per cent at the end of 1986)
was held in securities issued or guaranteed by member govern

Loan Disbursements and Repayments

Disbursements from ordinary capital resources during 1987
amounted to $693 million, bringing the cumulative
disbursements from this source to $6,785 million up to the
end of 1987. Repayments during the year from loans held
by the Bank amounted to $440 million. As af end December
1987, cumulative loan repayments reached $1,918 million.
This consisted of $1,961 million on loans held by the Bank
and $17 million on portions sold to participants.

' Income and Expenses

The Bank's total income in 1987 was $976 million, an increase of $101 million, or 11.6 Per cent, over total income
in 1986. Income from loans rose by $106 million and income
from other sources increased by $2 million while incame from
investments dropped by $7 million.

Total expenses In 1987 were $669 million, an increase of
$81 million, or 13.8 per cent over total expenses in 1986,
Financial expenses increased by $84 million while services to
member countries decreased by $3 million,

Net income in 1987 rose to $307 million from $287 million
in 1986.

Reserves

The Bank’s Ordinary Reserve rose from $1,373 million in
1986 to $1,602 million in 1987. The increase was due ta the
transfer of $287 million net Income for the year ended 31
December 1986, which was partly offset by a net charge of
$58 million resulting from the restatement of the Bank's capital
stock in terms of SDR,

In accordance with Resolution No. 163 adopted by the
Board of Governors in March 1984, no commisston has been
charged on outstanding ordinary operations loans since the
beginning of 1986. Consequently, the Special Reserve remained unchanged during 1987 at £177 million.

Replenishment of ADF and TASF (ADF V)

THE replenishment of the Asian Development Fund and the
Technical Assistance Special Fund (ADI! V) was authorized
by Governors’ Resolution No. 182 in October 1986. The
replenishinent, amounting in total to $3.6 billion (at the exchange rates specified in the Resolution), is intended to finance
the Bank's concessional lending program over the four-year
period 1987-90, while $72 million is to be set aside and
allocated to the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF)
for technical assistance to poorer DMCs and for regiunal
technical assistance. All! V came into effect in May 1987
when the Bank had received from developed member countries unqualified Instruments of Contribution in excess of the
minimum trigger for effectiveness of $1,800 milllon specified
in the Resolution.

At the end of 1987, ADF V Instruments of Contribution
had been received from 14 member countries for a total
amount of $2,393 million. Thirteen of these counties, namely, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Federal Republic of
Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea,
New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom, had
deposited unqualified Instruments of Contribution.! Canada
had deposited an Instrument of Contribution containing a
qualification, as permitted by the Resolution, that all instalment payments except the first would be subject lo budgetary
appropriations, Pursuant to the Resolution, the first tranches
of all 14 contributions were available to the Bank for opera
tional commitments, From the first instalment payment of each
contrbntion an amoutit, in proportion te the amount of the
contribution, was set aside and allocated to TAS’ in accor
dance with the Resolution. The Resolution envisages that the
second tranches of the unqualified contributions would
beceme available for operational commitments on 1 January
1988. The “trigger” arrangements specified in the Resolution

1 Unguabfied {struments of Contibution ware received irom Austia,

require countries making a qualified contribution to deposit
their Instrument of Contribution by 1 January 1988, for the
second tranches of others to be released by that date.
However, the United States, which intends to make a qualified
contribution, while receiving authorization for its contribution ,
has not received the necessary appropriation of funds, Accordingly, its Instrument has not been deposited and the second tranches have not yet been released.

Third ADF Replenishment (ADF 1¥V)

The third ADF replenishment (ADF [V) was authorized by
Govemors’ Resolution No. 154 in July 1982 to finance the
Bank's concessional lending program over the fo ur-year perlod
1983-1986. The total amount authorized was $3,214 snillion
{at the exchange rates specified in the Resolution) All 21
ADF IV donor countries contributed to the replenishment, In
addition, France and New Zealand made additional contributions totalling $17 million, while Spain, shortly after becom.
ing a member of the Bank in February 1986, deposited a contribution commitment equivalent to $25 million fat ihe endDecember 1984 exchange rates).

The ADF IV Instruments of Contribution deposited by
Canada and the United States both contain a qualification that
Payment of their contribution instalments 's subject to
budgetary appropriations. By the end of 1986, Canada had
made available all four tranches of tts contribution in full, while
the United States had made available Its first three tranches
and $57.1 million, or 43.93 per cent, of its fourth tranche.
Pursuant to the ADF 1V “trigger” arrangements, therefore,
the fourth tranches of the unqualified ADF IV contributions
stood released to the extent of 43.93 per cent. Australia,
Belgium and Norway, however, had voluntarily released their
fourth tranches in full. There were no changes to this position during 1937,1

Availability and Utilization of ADF
Resources

After allowing for a provision against exchange rate fluctuations, the net resources available for loan commitments at
the beginning of 1987 amounted to about $784 million. During the year the Bank received ADF V first tranches totalling
$841 milllon (at the 31 December 1987 exchange rates), of
which $774 million was for ADF and $67 million was allocated
to TASF. A further $39 million accrued to ADF by way of
net income. Moreover, resources increased significantly during the year as a result of the appreciation of most contribu
tion currencies against the US dollar, Including changes In
value in tetms af the US dollar, the increase in total ADF

IRDD likewise restructured into two Agriculture Departments,
East and West.

In order to give formal recognition to the Importance glyven

Environment Unit attached to the Office of the Director, Infrastructure Department, was established, effective 1 May.

A teview of the Bangladesh Resident Office {BRO) was

analytical framework which can serve as basis for assessing
future staff requirements both in terms of number and type
of expertise, consistent with various levels and types of future
Bank activities, The Task Force !s expected to finalize its report
in early 1988

Pacific Developing Member Countries and conducted an audit
of the South Pacific Regional Office. It also undertook postimplementation reviews of a number of computerized systems
and participated in the development of computer systems and

Budget

Internal Administrative Expenses for 1987 amounted
te $89.547 million against the original Budget of
$94.242 million,! representing 95 per cent utilization of the
latter. The under-utilization of $4.695 million, or 5 per cent,
against the original Budget is due mainly to savings arising
from lower-than-budgeted expenses for the Board of Directors, staff benefits, staff relocation, consultant services, business
travel, representation, other administrative expenses and nonuse of the general contingency.

A budget of $98.446 million, which is summarized In
Appendix 1, is provided for Internal Administrative Expenses
in 1988. This represents an increase of $8.899 million, or
10 per cent, over actual expenses in 1987. The Increase is
for: () the full-year effect of Improvements in salary and
benefits and the establishment of the Indonesia Resident Office In 1987; (il} additional staff, consultant services, business
travel and other overhead expenses in support of the Bank's
operations in 1988; (ili) provisions for prospective price escalations; and (iv) provision for general contingency,

Commitments for Services to Member Countries in 1987
amounted to $25,971 million, representing almost full utilization of the original Budget and an increase of 8 per cent over
actual commitments In 1986, A provision of $30 million is
budgeted for new commitments in 1984, representing an increase of 16 per cent over the actual commitments in 1987,

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK — ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1987 and 31 December 1986

NOTE A — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

Uhe currencies of members are functional currencies. The reporting
currency is the United States dollar, and the financial statements are
expressed in thousands of current United States dollars,

Valuation of Capital Stock

The capital stock 1s defined in Article 4, paragraph 1 of the Articles
of Agreement Fslablishing the Bank (the Charter) “in terms of
United States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on
31 danuary 1966" (Ihe 1966 dollar) and the value of each share is
defined as 10,000 1966 dollars. The capital stock had historically
been hanslated into the current United States dollar (the Bank's unit
of accounl) un the basis of its par value in terms of gold. From 1973
until 31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on this basis was $1.20635
per 1966 dollar. Since L April 1978, at which time the Second
Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the international
Monetary Fund ([MF} came into effect, currencies no longer have
par values in lens of gold, Pending the Bank's selection of the
approptiale successor to the 1966 dollar, the capital stock has been
valued for purposes of these financial statements in terms of the
Special Drawing Right (SDR) at the value in current United States
dollars as computed by the IMF, with each share valued at
SPR 10,000

As of 31 December 1987, the value of the SDR in terms of the cur
cent United States dollar was $1.41866 ($1.22319 — 1986) giving
a value for each share of the Bank's capital equivalent to
$14,186.60 ($12,231.90 — 1996). However, the Bank cauld
decide to [ix the value of each share at $12,063.50 based on the
31 March 1978 par value of the United States dollar in terms of
gold. If the capital stock as of 31 December 1987 had been valued in
terrns of $12,063.56 per share, the net maintenance of value
obligations would have been $142,545.0U0 payable to members
{¥94,454,000 receivable from members — 1986)instead of
$219, 312,000 {$150,666,000 — 1986) receivable fram members

Translation of Currencies

Assets and liabilities are translated from their functional currencies to
the reporting currency generally at the applicable rates of exchange
at the end of a reporting perlod, Income and expense amounts are
translated for each seml-monithly period generally at the appheable
tates of exchange at the beginning of each pevied; such prachce approximates the application of average rates in effect during the
period. Translation adjustments other than those relating ta maintenance of value of currency haldings (see Notes F ane J), are
charged or credited to “Accumulated translation adjustments”, Fx
CONTINUED

change gains or lusses on currency transactions among functional
cunrencies are included ws income. Currency swaps made in connec:
tion with borrowings ate hedged by forward exchange com:
mitnienls, and accordingly do not result in any net exchange gain or
loss,

Investments

Investment securities are reported at cost cr amortized cost. Gains
and losses on sales of investments are measured by the difference
between average cost or amortized cost and the net proceeds of
sales.

Loans

The Bank's loans have been made to or guaranteed by members or
their goverrunents, with exception of loans to the private sector, and
bave maturities ranging between 10 and 30 years. The Bank re:
quires its borrowers to absorb exchange risks attributable to fluctuations in the value of the currencies which it has disbursed. The Bank
has not suffered any loan losses to date and follows a policy of not
taking part in debt rescheduling agreements,

Prior to 1 July 1986, the lending rate of the Bank was based on a
fixed lending rate system under which loans carried interest rates
(xed al the time of loan approval for the entire life of the loans. The
rate from 1 January 1986 to 30 June 1986 was 9.65% per annum.
Effective 1 July 1986, the Bank adopted a pool-based variable lending rate systern for those loans approved cn cr after that date plus
certain others at the option of the borrowers, Under the system the
lending rate is adjusted on I January and 1 July of each yeav and is
determined by adding a spread, 0.50% per annum (reduced to
0.40% per annum as of 1 January 1988), to the average cost of
oulstanding Bank borrowings included In the pool. The rate
adopted on 1 duly 1987 was 7.03% per annum.

Equliy Investments
Equity investments are reported at cost,
Property, Furniture and Equipment

The headquarters building of the Bank, including land. facilities and
fixtures and the initial cost of necessary staff amenities and other
related furnishings have been provided to the Bank by the Government of the Republic of the Philppines (Government) which has
also provided additional office space In a second building. The Bank
lias leased additional office space In other buildings and has fitted
and furnished all additional office space. Significant purchases of
property, furniture and equipment by the Bank are capitalized and
depreciated over estimated useful tives of related assets using the
straight-line method. Other purchases are charged to expense.

NOTE D — ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND
ADMINISTRATION CHAKGE

Administrative expenses include an administration charge amount
ing to $45,597,000 ($40,621,000 — 1986), The charge represenls
an apportionment af all administrative expenses of the Bank (other

NOTE E — SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph L(i of the
Articles of Agreement Establishing the Bank, the Board of Governots has authorized the selling asirie of 10% of the unimpaired
“paid-in capital paid by members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph
2{a) and of the convertible currency portion paid by members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(b} as of 28 April 1973, to be used as
a part of the Special Funds of the Bank. The capital so set aside was
allocated and transferred from the Ordinary Capital Resources to
the Fund as Set-Aside Resourtes.

The capital stock of the Bank Js defined in Article 4, paragraph 1 "in
terms of United States dollars of the welght and fineness in effect on
31 January 1966" (the 1966 dollar). Therefore, Set-Aside
Resources had historically been translated Into the current United
States dollar (the Bank’s unit of account}, on the basis of its par
value in terms of gold. From 1973 until 31 March 1978, the rate arrivad at on this basis was $1.20635 per 1966 dollar, Since 1 April
1978, at which lime the Second Amendrnent to the Articles of
Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came Into effecl, currencies no longer have par values in ternis of gold, Pending
the Bank's selection of the appropriate successor to the 1966 dollar,
the Sel-Aside Resources has heen valued for purposes of the accompanying financial statements in terms of the Special Drawing
Right (SDR), at the value in current United States dollars as computed by the IMF. As of 31 December 1987, the value of the SDK In
terms of the current United States dollar was $1.41866 ($1.22319
— 1986}. On this hasis, Set-Aside Rescurces amounted to
$67,542,000 ($58,236,000 — 1986). If the capital stock of the
Bank as of 31 December 1987 had been valued in terms of
$12,063.50 per share, Set-Aside Resources would have been
$57,434,000.Deloitte

ECONOMIC BACKGROUND

The developing member countries of Asia showed
uneven gains in the field of economic development
in 1972. Many countries made satisfactory progress
and, but for adverse weather conditions, development
efforts would have yielded more significant results
throughout the region. The impact of unfavorable
weather conditions, which brought in their wake both
drought and flood, was unprecedented. Agricultural
outputs, which had steadily grown in recent years,
and food harvests, in particular, were adversely
affected.

Shortfalls in production resulted in higher export
prices for certain agricultural commodities, but the
prices of some other agricultural export items slumped
to their lowest levels in over a decade. This placed
the balance of payments of certain countries under
heavy strain; some countries, however, experienced
steadily increasing external reserves.

Development assistance to the region as a whole
appears to have declined during the year. But this
weakening of the aid effort was pronounced only in
respect of a few counties; several others received
increased flows of foreign assistance. The burden of
debt-service, however, continued to increase and
tecourse to the rescheduling of payments became
more common than in earlier years. At the same time,
progress in the direction of untying of purchases
under foreign assistance was minimal. while the terms
of new tending showed no appreciable improvement.

{In several countries of the region, armed hostilities
and political uncertainties also continued to hamper
economic and social development. Moreover, the
continued increase in population substantially reduced, if not nullified, the increase in national products. Unemployment, which was generally on the
increase, and economic inequalities threatened to
aggravate social tensions. .

As a result, the traditional strategies of development have come increasingly under scrutiny and
macro-economic trends as indicators of economic
growth have, in particular, come under question.
The resolution of mass poverty and unemployment
and the narrowing of social and economic inequalities
have been given high priority in many countries.
Some of these new approaches to development
problems would be relevant to foreign aid policies
as well.

In the international field, the realignment of the
major currencies and the other reforms concluded by
the Smithsonian Agreement of December 1977 began
to take effect during the year. The Committee of
Twenty¡ªon which developing countries are aiso
represented¡ª¡ªbegan its deliberations on the many
proposals made for further reform and readjustment
of the international monetary system.

Pending the establishment of a new monetary
order, various monetary realignments among developed countries made in the transition period have
resulted in some hardship to many of the regional
developing member countries. Most of these countries held the bulk of their external reserves in
currencies that depreciated. Debt repayment obligations denominated in these currencies remained
substantially the same. Where there were debt
obligations denominated in the currencies that appreciated, the purchasing power of external reserves was
reduced. Overall, the impact on the debt-service
burden was distinctly unfavorable.

The net effect of the change in parities of major
international currencies also contributed to a worsening in the terms of trade for many Asian countries,
even though the region¡¯s foreign trade, as a whole,
continued to increase at a reasonable rate.

Expectations of a further liberalization of trade
between the developed and the developing countries
and the acceptance of schemes for the stabilization
of commodity exports from developing countries remained largely unfulfilled at the conclusion of the .
Third United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development. In this respect, a measure of progress
was made by tariff reductions on certain imports into
Japan. More significant progress in this field would
depend on the outcome of efforts aimed at a further
tationalization of world trade, particularly through the
forthcoming round of the GATT negotiations.

The improved prospects for peace in the wardevastated countries of the region brought ta the fore
the massive problems of reconstruction and rehabilitation of their economies. This does not, however,
imply that the needs of other developing member
countries are less urgent. By the end of the year, the
marshalling of efforts to meet all these needs. both at
the national and international level, seemed to be
emerging as the predominant task on the Asian scene.THE YEAR IN BRIEF

The year 1972 was marked by a significant growth
of the Bank's lending and technical assistance
activities.

The financial structure of the Bank was substantially strengthened during the year when the 150
per cent increase of the Bank's authorized capital,
approved in 1971, became effective. The Bank also
initiated measures for the reorganization and replenishment of its Special Funds resources.

Loan approvals during 1972 totalled $316.09
million¡¯ against $254.03 million in 1971¡ªan increase of about 24 per cent. By the end of the year
the Bank had made 117 loans¡ª73 from ordinary
capital resousces and 44 from the Special Funds¡ª
totalling $954.55 million?

The year's lending activities covered all the major
sectors of economic development. About 60 per cent
of the loans in 1972 was made to assist the development of infrastructure facilities¡ª-electric power,
transport and communications.

An outstanding feature of the year's activities was
the sharp increase in concessional loans from $61.51
million in 1971 ta $94.34 million in 1972. Concessional loans accounted for 50 per cent of total lending
in 1972 in terms of number and 30 per cent in terms
of amount: the corresponding figures for 1971 were
43 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.

The Bank continued to attach considerable irnportance to its technical assistance activities. Fourteen technical assistance projects¡ªmost of them
involving project preparation ¡ª were approved during
the year at an estimated cost of $1.8 million. In
addition, the Bank agreed to function as an executing

authority for two projects financed by the United 
Nations Development Programme. At the end of the
year, the Bank was involved in 74 technical assistance
projects in the various developing member countries
at an estimated total cost of $11.3 million?

Four new regional activities were approved during
the year¡ªthe Study of the Asian Institute for
' Exeludes one loan for $14.6 million which the borrower was

unable to utilize and on which action to rescind the approval

was taken in Fabruary 1973.

2 Excludes $0.4 million approved in 1968 and $0.6 million approved
in 1970 incorporated in new loans in 1970 and 1971, respectively.

4 Including projects financed from other sources costing $1.6
million.

Economic Development and Planning: assistance to
the Asian Productivity Organization for its Third
Project Feasibility Study Training Course; the conducting of a Regional Workshop on Srrigation Water
Management; and a Feasibility Study of the Trans
Strait of Malacca Ferry Service. By the end of the
year the Bank had undertaken 716 different regional
activities.

It is a matter of concern that on the basis of loan
approvals to the end of 1972 and of Special Funds
contributions already made or pledged, the balance of
Special Funds available for further lending¡ªatter
the commitment of $94.34 million in 1972¡ªwas
only about $20 milion, a level that obviously
cannot sustain the current tempo of the Bank's
concessional financing activities. The Bank's ability
to help further in meeting the minimum needs of the
developing member countries in the region with
concessional loans depends vitally on additional contributions being made urgently, widely and in adequate amounts, .

The Bank has initiated negotiations aimed at
simplifying its Special Operations and ensuring an
organized and regular replenishment of the Special
Funds resources. A meeting of the representatives of
developed member countries, held in Washington,
D.C., in September 1972 to discuss the restructuring
and replenishment program, expressed broad support
in principle for the proposals. This meeting was
followed in November by the appointment of a
Special Advisor to the President to assist the Bank in
contacting potential donor countries. Subsequently,
countries participating in the Seventh Ministeriat
Conference for the Economic Development of Southeast Asia expressed support for the restructuring
scheme in regard to the merging of the Agricultural
Special Fund with the Multi-Purpose Special Fund.

tn the meantime, the Bank is studying the possibility of setting aside, within the limits prescribed
by the Charter. further amounts for concessional
fending from the paid-in capital and is maintaining
the pace cf project preparation and appraisal work
so that Special Funds loans may be made, in suitable
cases, without further delay as and when such
additional funds become available.

systems constructed with Bank assistance are located in M'laug, Coiabato and in Banga, Sonth Cotabato.

dollar, the Board of Directors adopted the United
States dollar with a gold content of 0.818513 gram
of fine gold as the Bank's unit of account with effect
from 8 May. As a resuit of this decision, the capital
stock amounts have been restated in terms of such
unit of account.

The decision of the Board of Governors to increase
the capital stock by 165,000 sharesâ€”raising the
capital from $1.194,286,000 to $2.985,714.000' â€”
became effective on 23 Novernber, the total subscriptions received at that date having exceeded 100,000
shares, the minimum specified by the Board of
Governors.

The Bank continued to borrow funds ona selective
basis from the international capital markets. Three
bond issues totalling the equivalent of $58.6 million
were made in Luxembourg and in Italy, for the first
time, and in Japan, for the third time. The borrowings
at the end of the year totatled the equivalent of $230.5
million.

Borrowings in 1972 were considerably less,
however, than those in the previous year because, in
â€œrecognition of the time-lag between joan commitments and disbursements, it was found appropriate
to relate the Bankâ€™s liquidity more to its disbursement needs than to its loan commitments. The

Bank's liquidity policy now aims at maintaining liquid
assets at not fess than two-thirds of the next three
yearsâ€™ projected loan disbursements.

The Bank's Muiti-Purpose Special Fund was
augmented by three contributionsâ€”from Belgium,
Denmark and New Zealand. Belgium's contribution of the equivalent of $2.23 million, which is subject to
tatification by the Belgian Parliament, is payable in
four equal instalments. Denmark replaced its contribution to the Agricultural Special Fund with a new
contribution of the equivalent of $2.15 million to the
Multi-Purpose Special Fund. New Zealand's contribution was the equivalent of $1.00 million. The
Technical Assistance Special Fund received commit- .
ments totalling $3,485,925 from eight countries.

The Kingdom of Tonga joined the Bank during
the year, raising the total membership to 37.

Mr. Takeshi Watanabe, the first President of the
Bank, resigned on 24 Navember. The Board of
Governors unanimously elected Mr. Shiro Inoue to
succeed Mr. Watanabe. Mr. Inoue assumed the
Presidency of the Bank on 25 November.

The construction by the Philippine Government
of the new headquarters building for the Bank on
Roxas Boulevard in Greater Manila was completed
in the last quarter of the year. The Bank's offices
were transferred to the new building at the end of
October. The building was formally inaugurated by
His Excellency Ferdinand E. Marcos, President of
the Phifippines, on 18 November.LENDING AND OPERATING POLICIES

The Bank continues to keep under review its
policies with regard to lending operations so as to
better-meet the growing and changing requirements
of the region. The main task of the Bank is the financing of specific projects, which are identified initially
on the basis of their compatibility with priorities in @
member countryâ€™s national and sectoral development
plans. Subsequently, each project is subjected to a
thorough evaluation to ascertain whether it is
economically and technicaily viable and sound in
financial, organizational and managerial aspects.
Due regard is given to the social benefits of the
project, although these are often diffused and not
easily quantifiable. Substantial sectoral diversification of projects has occurred, both within particular
countries and in the region as 4 whole with no
specific economic sectors being given 4 priori
emphasis. However, a particular countryâ€™s development strategy may lead the Bank to agree that emphasis should be placed on a particular sector in the
short run to assist that member in meeting its
development goals.

During the year. the Board of Directors studied a

number of policy issues, two of which are of special
interest (Criteria for Special Funds Loans and Financing of Technical Assistance) and are discussed below.
A number of vital policy issues were scheduled for
further consideration by the Board of Directors
early in 1973. These included: Strategy for Bank
Operations in Less Developed Regional Developing
Member Countries; Review of Guidelines on the
Uses of Consultants; Special Funds Restructuring;
Lending Policies and Procedures with Reference to
Two-Step Lending; Examination of the Economic and
the Financial Evaluation of Projects during Appraisal;
Joint/Paralle] Financing: Review of Guidelines on
Procurement Review of Liquidity Policy: and Review
of investment Guidelines.

Criteria for Special Funds Loans

The Board of Directors adopted in July 1972 a
series of criteria for Bank policy guidance in extending
loans on concessional terms from the Special Funds
resources. The salient features of the criteria, subject

1 Loans on which the proceeds of Bank loans are relent by the
borrower to other institutions or to firms,

to annual review, are as follows:

(a)

(b)

(c).

(d)

(e)

(f)

(9)

In financing from Special Funds resources,
the economic situation of the Developing
Member Cauntry (DMC) should be given
the greatest consideration.

Among the several DMCâ€™s, highest priority
should be given to the smailer and less
developed members.

An order oft relative priority among the DMCâ€™s
for Special Funds lending has been attempted,
based on certain economic indicators. The
tank order will, however, have to be adjusted
regularly to reflect the changing economic
conditions in the member countries. it has
not been thought realistic to attempt to
group DMC's into high, low and intermediate
priority countries.

Within a particular DMC, the nature of
projects to be financed from Special Funds
should be given due attention in project
selection. Projects with direct and sustained
foreign exchange earning or saving capacity
in general will be given lower priority. Projects with high economic and social value or
those with very long gestation periods
should be eminently qualified for such loans
even though having indirect financial returns
and/or law foreign exchange earning/saving
capacity.

Projects to be financed from Special Funds
should be subject to the same evaluation as
projects utilizing ordinary capital resources.
The criteria for decision on whether to extend
a loan will not differ according to source of
funds

The range of project types available for
Special Funds financing within a DMC wilt
relate to the relative priority of that country
for access to concessional resources
Countries with the highest relative priority
may be eligible for Special Funds financing
for all of their projects.

The range of project types available for

. concessional lending will also be conditioned

by the overall availability of Special Funds
resources.(h) The existing flexibility in the terms and conditions of Special Funds loans has some
merits and should be retained for the time
being. While the economic situation of the
DMC shouid be the primary consideration
in deciding the terms, as a whole, in suitable
special cases the nature of the project should
aiso be taken into account.

{i) Additional flexibility may be achieved by the
biending of finance from Special Funds and
ordinary capital resources. Such blending
may occur at the project or the country level,
where appropriate.

Financing of Technical Assistance

The Board of Directors also considered during the
year the question of the financing of technical
assistance operations by the Bank. Wher providing
project preparation technical assistance on a grant
basis, the Bank's norma! practice had been to
include in the agreement a clause to the effect that,
should the technical assistance result in a loan
from the Bank, all or part of the grant could be
converted into the ensuing loan at the option of the
Bank. When a. Joan did result, that portion of the
grant which was directly project-oriented and was
utilized directly for subsequent project preparation
for a Bank loan was normally converted into the
loan.

After examining the matter further, the Board
decided to change to a pre-determined basis of conversion as follows:

Republic of Korea: Brisk activities at the
Seoul City Wholesale Fish Marker. A
Bank toan assisted in the provision of
feezing, cold storage, ice-mating and ice
storage and supplementary processing
facilities in Seoul, Pusan, Mokpo and
Mutkho, and marketing facilities in Seoul,
together with appropriate transportation
equipment. The Cold Storage Project
was completed in 1972.

(a) all developing member countries will be
eligible for grants for project preparation
technical assistance without discrimination;

(b) â€˜in the event of a loan resulting, that portion
of the grant over and above $100,000 will
always be converted into the subsequent
loan on the same terms as the loan: except
that

{c) the cost of design and engineering, if
included as part of the initial grant, will
always be converted to the subsequent loan.

Advisory technical assistance, including regional

projects of an advisory nature, will normally be
extended on a grant basis. Technical assistance for
project implementation will normaily be included in
the loan amount but may, in appropriate cases, be
extended on a grant basis.

Loan Administration

As the Bank's lending activities increased and
Bank-financed projects moved into more critical
stages of implementation, stronger emphasis has
been laid on loan administration and project supervision. The continuing review of loan administration
procedures and practices was intensified during the
year and further studies made with a view to further
improving the existing system. Regular monthly and
quarterly assessments of project progress have been
carried out on an inter-departmental basis in order to
identify problem areas and operational bottlenecks
that tend to interrupt orderly project implementation.
Measures to resolve such difficulties as they arosewere worked out in cooperation with borrowers.
Special attention was given to procedures designed
to anticipate problems which could disrupt the
effective execution of projects and to facilitate preventive measures.

Field inspection of projects was intensified: $6
Review Missions were mounted in connection with
43 projects (49 Missions in 1971).

The pace of awarding of contracts has greatly
accelerated â€” $155.83 million in 1972 as against
$656.25 miltion in 1871. This improvement has been
due partly to increased familiarity on the part of
borrowers with procurement procedures and requirements. Frequent consultations were conducted with
borrowers on measures to improve disbursement
projections and expedite withdrawals. The tables
below illustrate the position of contracts awarded

and disbursements as at the end of 1972 in relation
to loan commitments and loans which became
effective, respectively, over the period 1968 to 1972.

Loan cancellations in 1972 amounted to $21.614
million. These were brought about by reductions
in offshore procurements. refinancing from other
sources (asanticipated at the time of loan approval),
and project cancellations at the request of the
borrower.

In the light of experience so far gained, the
Bank has initiated an extensive review of the practices
and procedures on the uses of consultants by the
Bank and its borrowers with a view to introducing
improvements. The principles and guidelines governing the employment of consultants were under
review by the Board of Directors at the end of the
year,

Lending Operations

The Bank's lending operations recorded a substantial increase in 1972 following a period of
consolidation in 1971. Thirty-two loans totalling
$316,090,000 were approved during the yeas compared with 28 loans for $254,030,000 in 1971. The
ioans were made to 14 countries, including Fiji and
Hong Kong which received their first loans from the
Bank.

By the end of 1972 the Bank had made 117 loans
totalling $954,553,000.' Of these, 73 loans for
$753,005,000' were from ordinary capital resources
and 44 loans for $201.548,000 from Special Funds
resources.

The average size of Bank loans recorded a further
increase in 1972. The average size of loans from
ordinary capital resources was $13.9 million, as
compared with $12.7 million in 1971, and of those
from Special Funds resources, $5.9 million as
against $4.3 million in the preceding year.

Projections based on loans in an advanced stage
of consideration at the end of the year suggest that
total loan approvals may reach the $1 billion mark
by the middie of 1973.

 

There were two significant trends in the yearâ€™s
operations. First, mainly as the result of the Bank's
active participation in project identification and
preparation, a number of smaller and less developedâ€™
countries, including Fiji, which received its first
loan, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, the
Republic of Viet-Nam and Western Samoa received
much larger financial assistance than in 1971.
Bank loans to these countries in 1972 and the
preceding year, respectively, were as follows: Fiji
$4.7 million (nil); Nepal $20.8 million ($4.5 mitlion):
Papua New Guinea $9.8 million ($4.5 million):
Sri Lanka $11.10 million ($7.75 million): the
Republic of Viet-Nam $6.3 million ($2.5 million);
and Western Samoa $2.6 million ($0.33 miflion).
The overail share of these six countries in Bank
lending in 1972 was 17.5 per cent as compared
with 7.8 per cent in 1971.

Second, mainly as a sequel to the expanded
operations in the countries mentioned above, the
Bank's concessional lending recorded during the
year a sharp increase of $42.83 million to $94.34
million or 83 per cent. This was the largest annual
increase since Specia! Operations started in 1969.

As a proportion of total annual lending, loans from
Special Funds increased from 20.3 per cent in 1971
to 29.8 per cent in 1972.

Sixteen loans were made from Special Funds
resources during 1972 as against 12 loans tn the
preceding year. Six countriesâ€”Indonesia, Nepal,
Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, the Republic of
Viet-Nam and Western Samoaâ€”received their entire
financial assistance from the Bank on concessional
terms. A substantial part of Bank assistance to
Pakistan was also given, for the first time, on concessional terms through a blend of loans from
ordinary capital resources and Special Funds resources.

The continued expansion in the Bankâ€™s concessional lending activities and projects in the pipeline
underlines, more ihan ever before. the urgency and
importance of the measures now under way for the
replenishment of Special Funds resources.

Loans approved during the year will assist a wide
range af development activities, including for the
first time the construction of a sea water desalting
plant (in Hong Kong), the largest of its kind designed
so far.

At the end of the year the sectoral distribution of
the Bank's lending also showed a more even distribution than in earlier years. Loans for Electric

Power {on a cumulative basis) forrned the largest
group with 28.6 per cent. followed by Industry with
24.7 per cent, Transport and Communications 21.4
per cent, Agriculture 13.1 per cent, Water Supply
11.5 per cent and Education less than 1 per cent.
Lending activities on a sectoral basis, for the year
and on a cumulative basis to the end of 1972, are
shown in the table below.

A feature of the Bank's activities in several
countries is the integrated manner in which assistance
has been given to more than one project in the same
area, Although each project is assessed an the basis
of its own economic viability and other standard
criteria, the combination of these projects in such
areas promises to be an effective tool for promoting
the economic development of the region concerned.

Typical of this integrated approach are the
irrigation, road and power projects in the Chitwan
Valley in Nepal; two complementary power: projects
in West and Central Sumatra in Indonesia; two
projects to improve water supply and control water
pollution in Seoul in the Republic of Korea; and the
series of irtigation, road improvement end power
projects in Mindanao in the Philippines.

Â» The overall financial impact of the Bank's loans
cannot be measured oniy by the volume of its lending
which covers the foreign exchange costs of the

(0,7%)projects concerned. Additionally, the borrowers raise
matching local currency resources and, where necessary, supplement the Bank's foreign currency loans
with funds from bilateral and other multilateral
sources. The catalytic effect of Bank financing on
capital formation and productive investments in
developing member countries has, therefore. been
significant.

At the end of 1972, the total cost of projects for
which the Bank had provided direct financing was
estimated to be $1,640 million, of which Bank loans
represented approximately 46 per cent. in addition,
the Bank has provided indirect financing through
national development banks for projects with an
estimated cost of about $600 million, of which the
Bank's loans accounted for about 27 per cent.

Social Impact

Realizing the importance of distributing the
benefits of Bank activities as widely as possible to
the peoples of developing countries, the Bank is
giving increasing attention to the social impact of
its lending.

in the areas of substantial social impact, lending
for education, particularly in the field of agriculture
and vocational training, is being given special
attention. Since unemployment is widespread in the
Asian region, one of the principal remedial measures
is to help orient educational systems to the requirements of the technical age. In this broad category,
also, the Bank's water supply projects meet a growing
need in the cities in view of the rapid pace of urbanization in the region. Economic considerations are also
important in both of these areas of Bank activity.

There is a variety of projects of a basically
econornic character which have a definitely discernible social content. These include the Bank's
agricultural projects in such fields as rural credit and
irrigation which will help small farmers in several
countries, particularly in areas where land reform has
already been initiated. Such projects have special
significance in regard to the implementation of land
reform. Several of the Bank's projects in the Republic
of Korea will support Government efforts to improve
the well-being of the rural population, and thus decrease income-disparity in relation to urban residents.

Bank loans for the development of fisheries are
expected to promote the gainful employment of
small-scale fishermen in several countries, with
attendant economic and social benefits.

From the Bank's assistance in the transport and
other sectors in certain less-developed regions in
Afghanistan, Malaysia and the Philippines, some
amelioration of regional disparities in income is
expected to result. Similarly, road projects serving

rural areas will facilitate the modernization process
and enable the producer to find wider and more
assured markets for his crops. The Bank's loans for
highways are expected to facilitate the dispersal of
economic activities and residential communities. thus
mitigating the problem of urban congestion.

The Bank's lending for the power sector in sural
areas is expected to have significant social benefits â€”
by promoting income-earning capacity in specific
areas, diversifying economic activities and increasing
employment opportunities. and providing certain
basic necessities of modern life to a large number of
people.

Outlook

The increase in the Bankâ€™s tending and technical
assistance provides a fitting backdrop to the increase
in capital, now being implernented, and the measures
under way for the replenishment and reorganization
of the Special Funds. The main thrust of the Bank's

activities is expected to continue in the direction of.

supporting, in as flexible a manner as possible,
development priorities of national and regional
significance. In the case of the less-developed of the
developing countries in particular, the increased
emphasis on technical assistance in project preparation promises to yield more projects for Bank financing. .

At the same time. the far-reaching effects of events
in Southeast Asia suggest that the Bank will have to
assume an even wider role as a regional development
finance institution. The economic rehabilitation and
develapment work to be done in the war-devastated
areas of Southeast Asia and the organized efforts to
develop the potential of the Mekong Basin will call
for. new strategies and action by the Bank, as well as
by other multilateral and bilateral aid agencies.

As a financial institution which has been engaged
since 1968 in a variety of financing and technical
assistance activitiesâ€”some of them of a pioneering
nature in the Khmer Republic, Laos, Thailand and
the Republic of Viet-namâ€”the Bank has gained
experience which will be invaluable in meeting the
challenges ahead. Consistent with its resources and
its expanding activities in the region as a whole, the
Bank stands ready to share the burden of reconstruction and development in this area.

The geographical and economic pattern of the
Bank's new regional members may also dictate a
different approach, within the existing framework of
operational policies, in .deating with their specific
development problems. This applies particularly in
regard to the growing number of ielatively small
countries joining the Bank from the South Pacific
region.

14Technical Assistance

The Bank continued to expand its technical
assistance activity in 1972. Primarily, the assistance
has been aimed at helping member countries â€”-particularly, ihe less developed of the developing member
countries â€”to prepare projects for subsequent Bank
financing. In addition, advisory and operational
assistance has been granted for project implementation and for the upgrading of local expertise.

The importance of technical assistance in generating investment can be seen in the number of Bank
loans resulting from this activity. Of the ioans made
by the Bank to the end of 1972, 16 loans totalling
$143.22 million followed technical assistance provided earlier by the Bank.

Fourteen projects (excluding regional activities)
were approved during the year for a total cost of
$1.8 million (compared with $71.5 million in 1971).
Two additional projects costing $1.5 million, in
which the Bank acts as an executing authority, using
outside funds, were also approved. These 16 projects
covered ten developing member countries and nearly
90 per cent of them were for project preparation, the
temainder being advisory or project implementation
services.

Since the first Project in 1967â€”a study of food
grain production in Indonesiaâ€”technica! assistance
undertaken by the Bank in member countries totals
74 projects at an estimated cost of $11.3 million.
ln addition the Bank has become involved in 15
regional technical assistance projects. (See Chapter
on Regional Activities.)

The assistance during the year covered a wide

One of the largest technical assistance projects
undertaken during the year was for flood control and
regional development in the Chakhansur area of
Afghanistan. The cost is estimated at $263,000. If
the feasibility study provided under the assistance
proves favorable, a project will be developed for the
construction of two dams which will remove the
danger of flooding and open the way for rapid
agricultural development.

Another large project, costing $295,000, went to
Indonesia for a study of Bandungâ€™s water supply and
thÃ© development of an improvement program which
could result in another Bank Joan to that country.
Indonesia is the largest recioient of Bank technical

Loans and Technical Assistance by Sector

The foliowing paragraphs deal with the Bank's
lending and technical assistance activities on a
sectoral basis.

Agriculture

 

Excepting Hong Kong and Singapore, ithe Bankâ€˜s
developing member countries have predominantly
agricultural economies. Agriculture, including forestry. fishery and livestock, constitutes their largest
single source of employment. The pace of economic
growth in these countries depends largely on the
performance of the agricultural sector which, overall,
accounts for almost half of the gross national product
and export earnings.

have led to loans from the Bank.

Indonesia was also involved in the sub-regional
project approved this year. Technical assistance,
estimated to cost $40,000, was approved for a
feasibility study of a ferry service across the Malacca
Strait from Belawan in Sumatra to Penang in West
Malaysia

Technical assistance activity during the year also
provided an instrument for closer cooperation with
other international development agencies engaged
in the region, particularly in regard to a pioneer
agricultural development scheme fn the Republic of
Viet-Nam and a water resources development project
in the Philippines in both of which the Bank is acting
as an executive authority.

Significantly. the Bank's involvement in the
agricultural sector began with the Asian Agricultural
Survey, a comprehensive action-oriented study which
has given the lead for the Bankâ€™s activities in this
vital sector in the past five years. 2%

Technical assistance to Indonesia in the field of
foodgrain production in 1967 and a loan for the
modernization of Sri Lankaâ€™s tea industry in 1968
marked the beginning of the Bank's commitment to
the development of agriculture and related fields.
Since then the Bank's lending and technical assistance activities in this sector have steadily expanded
in range and coverage.

Bank lending for agriculture in 1972 totalled
$32.84 million, an increase of 20 per cent over the
previous year. Five loans were approved, of which
three were for fisheries development and two for
irrigation/flood control.

Over the period 1867-1972, the Bank approved
31 loans totalling $124.73 million for the agricultural
sector â€”approximately 13 per cent of total lending.
However, agriculture accounted for 40 per cent of
the Bank's concessional financing activities, mostly
in the less developed member countries.

The major area of Bank involvement in the
agricultural sector has been water resources development, including the construction of dams, and_
irrigation, drainage and flood control systems. At
the end of 1972, loans under this category accounted
for 14 projects totalling $55.2 million. Other
financing activities in this area have covered agricultural research, extension, marketing and processing. Such an integrated approach has been a
distinctive feature of the Bank's activities in the
agricultural sector.

available over the past six years includes industrial
crops, agro-industries and farm mechanization.
During the period 1867-1972, the Bank approved
eight loans for a total of $25.2 million under this
heading. For the development of the fisheries and
livestock sub-sectors, the Bank has so far made
seven joans totalling $38.5 million.

The Bank's financing activities in the agricultural
sector have been interwoven with technica! assistanceâ€”~to a much larger extent than in any other
sector. During its six years of operation, the Bank
has undertaken 33 technical assistance projects in
agriculture involving an estimated outlay of $5.6
million (including one project financed with UNDP
resources).

Initially, advisory technical assistance bulked

large in the Bank's activities in the agricultural sector.
Since 1969, however. technical assistance for project
preparation and implementation has progressively
gained in importance.

At the regional level, the Asian Agricultural
Survey and the proceedings of the Regional Seminar
on Agriculture continue to influence the Bank's
policies and action in the agricultural sector. The
advances in the technology of rice and wheat
production in more recent years have, however,
brought about a significant change in the agricultural
situation, While the new improved seed accentuates
rather than alleviates infrastructure needs for adequate
water control and while climatic vagaries still dictate
fluctuations in food harvests, -there is a prospect of
greater frequency of regional abundance. This, in

1718

turn, has focused greater attention on the need for
crop diversification.

(t is in this changed context that the Bank has
been able to devote attention to a more diversified
range of regional activities including the regional
Study of the Coconut Industry on which work began
in 1972.

A Bank-sponsored Regional Workshop on Irrigation.Water Management, scheduled to be held in
January 1973, is expected to help expedite: the
successful implementation of 13 Bank-assisted
irrigation projects.

Similarly, the emerging role of the Bank as an
executive authority for the Go Cong Pioneer Agricultural Project in the Republic of Viet-Nam has
opened yet another promising area of activity for
the institution.

Electric Power

 

Electric power supply has become one of the
major yardsticks for measuring the economic and
social progress of a country. Recognizing the wide
gaps in electric power facilities in the region, the
Bank has played an increasingly important role in
financing the development of power systems in
several countries. The Bankâ€™s first loan for power
development was made in 1969 and its activities in
this sector have steadily expanded over the ensuing
three years. In 1971, the Bank rade nine loans
totalling $105.54 million: in 1972, 11 loans for
$124.10 million. At the end of 1972. the electric
power sector claimed the largest shareâ€”over 28
per centâ€”of the cumulative lending with 25 loans
totalling $272.79 million.

The Bank has lent funds to about 15 electric
power utilities at various stages of growth.

TOTAL 272.790In terms of overall development impact, it is
significant that several of these loans have been
directed to further strengthen and expand generation,
transmission and distribution facilities serving major
urban centers of the region, where ioad growth has
been rapid. At the end of 1972, loans totalling $105
million had been made to finance the foreign exchange portion of such energy projects in Bangkok,
Karachi. Saigon and Singapore.

The Bank has also financed certain major geographic extensions of existing systems, with the
main object of bringing electric energy to the smaller
towns and rural areas. Loans in this category
totalled about $80 million at the end of 1972.
Typical of such assistance for bringing power to
smatler towns and rural households for domestic,
agricultural and industrial uses are the Bank loans
for transmission, substation and distribution facilities
in the Republic of Korea and Thailand; and for

generation and transmission facilities in the Philippines (Mindanao) and Malaysia (Sarawak).

Of no less significance has been the Bank's active
role in the establishment, rehabilitation and initial
expansion of smaller systems in the region. a field
which has not attracted much attention from international finance agencies in the past. Loans under
this group amounted to about $30 million at the end
of 1972. Bank assistance to Fiji, the Khmer Republic,
Laos, Nepal. and Western Samoa and for the various
regional electricity districts in the outer islands of
Indonesia â€” Kalimanian, West Sumatra, South Sulawesi-â€”provides examples of such special emphasis
on the development of smaller systems in the region.

The Bank has also provided technical assistance
for project preparation and project implementation
in power development in Indonesia, the Khmer
Republic, Malaysia and Western Samoa

 

 

Industry

 

The Bank's policy of assisting industrial developmeni through toans to industrial development banks
for relending to small and medium scale industries
continued to be activey pursued during 1972. In
this field, the Bank made a further loan of $20 million
to the Korea Development Bank from the Bank's
ordinary capital resources and additional financial
assistance totalling $12 million to the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation from the
Bank's ordinary capital resources and Special Funds.

The Bank had made, at the end of 1972, 16 loans
totalling $164 million to development banks.â€™

Excluding non-industrial banks.

Additionally. the Bank had also given eighi. direct
loans totalling $72.17 millior to industrial projects.

Small and medium size enterprises form the core
of the industrialization programs in most developing
countries. The Bank has been helping to cover the
foreign exchange needs of this sector through loans
to national development banks which, in turn, meke these funds available to a |arge number of enterprises.

The beneficial effects of such Bank financing in
creating additional employment and technical skills,
in promoting investment of domestic and foreign
private capital in productive enterprises and in
familiarizing the business community with modern
concepts of corporate management have been widely
recognized in the countries concerned.

From the 13 credit line loans to development banks
that had become effective at 31 December 1972.
273 sub-ioans had been made. These sub-loans
supported a wide range of industria! and business
activities such as textiles, engineering, manufac- .
tured goods including leather, ruober, wood, paper,
minerals, iron and steel and non-ferrous metals:
chemicals; machinery and transport equipment; and
food and beverages.

Until the end of 1971. industry constituted the
largest sector in the Bank's lending activities. However, mainly because of the vigorous expansion in
the Bankâ€™s involvement in infrastructure projects
which themselves fuel industrial growth and in
schemes with significant social impact such as water
supply projects, the relative share of industry declined
from 32 per cent at the end of 1971 to 24.4 per cent

Transport and Communications

 

The important role of an integrated network of
transport and coramunication facilities in fostering
national and regional development has long been
recognized by the Bank's developing member
countries. It was mainly to this end that a meeting
of senior transport officials of Southeast Asian
countries in Kuala Lumpur decided in September
1967 to request the Bank to undertake a comprehensive regional transport survey covering all
modes of transport in the region.

The Survey, which was completed in 1971, has
Proposed a massive investment program covering
118 infrastructure projects. nine institution projects
and 14 vehicular projects over the 20-year period,
1971-1990. On the basis of the projects identified for
the 1970's the total investment needs are estimated
at $2.4 billion (for details see pages 45 and 46).

lt is evident that, like the Asian Agricultural Survey
in the agricultural sector, the Southeast Asian
Regional Transport Survey will provide a framework
for the Bank's activities in the transportation field,
at least among the countries which took part
in the Survey, for many years to come. The Bank
and the participating countries have already initiated
appropriate follow-up action. The implementation
of the recommendations will call for resources which
are beyond the capacities of the Governments can~
cerned and a substantial measure of foreign assistance
will be needed from bilateral and multilateral institutions. Within its modest resources, the Bank
stands ready to assist in the development of national
and regional transportation networks.

The Bank's performance in 1972 represents a
vigorous start in this direction. Both in volume and
range, the lending activities registered impressive
growth in the transport and communications sector
during the year.

Although the relative share of the transport and
communications sector in the total loan approvals
did not change. eight Joans totalling $67.55 million
were approved during the year as against six loans
for $44.20 million in 1971YRS ins,

The increased activity was primarily attributable to
the technical assistance given by the Bank in the
preceding years for specific project preparation. The
Transport Survey also facilitated identification of
high-priority projects in the countries covered by the
Survey. Of the loans and technical assistance approved by the Bank in recent years, at least six
projects covering port, airport and highway development and a sub-regional ferry service have emerged
partly as a result of the Survey.

The Bank's involvement in the transport and communications sector covers a wide range of projects.
This includes development of roads in rural areas,
highways and urban expressways; port rehabilitation
and .mechanization; construction of new port and
airport facilities; and extension of telecommunication
systems.

tn 1972 two loans were made to Indonesia for
the development of ports. Loans for the. development
of highways were extended~â€”oane each to the
Philippines and Nepal. Papua New Guinea will
undertake the development of two of its roads with
the assistance of a Bank loan. A loan to Singapore

industry. The telecommunication system in Western
Samoa will be expanded and modernized, with
financial assistance from the Bank.

Technical assistance was exiended, among others,
for a sub-regional project, a ferry link between
Belawan in Sumatra, Indonesia, and Penang in
Malaysia. The Bank has also assisted in the preparation of a road rehabilitation project on flood-stricken
Luzon Island in the Philippines. In the Republic of
Korea, the Bank has extended assistance by providing .
experts to help in the project preparation of expressways and highways in the Seoul-Incheon-Suweon
area. Afghanistan has received technical assistance
for the preparation of a road development project.

Projects selected for assistance by the Bank have
been on the basis of national priorities and mainly
designed either to assist in area development or to
eliminate constraints on capacity in critical areas of
transpori and communications.

Adequate piped water supply is a basic necessity
for the survival and growth of urban communities.
With overcrowding and other social problems
associated with urbanization, both Governments and
Municipalities are devoting increased attention and
funds to improve water supply.

Aside from domestic househoids which are the
major consumers of water, industrial and business
establishments, schools, hospitals, etc., are dependent
for their daily operations on an efficient system of
water supply. The growth of tourism will also require
improved water supply facilities.

The Bank's fourth loan. made in 1968. was for
the Penang Water Supply Project. Since then, water
supply projects have progressively gained in size and
importance in the Bank's lending activities. In 19Â°72
the Bank made four ,oans. totalling $58.9 million â€”

a significant increase over the two loans for $30.8
million in 1971. The share of water supply loans in the
overall lending of the Bank rose from 8 per cent to
11.5 per cent over the year

Of the four loans made in 1972 three were for
four cities with a population of over one million each
â€”Hong Kong, Busan and Daegu, and Seoul-â€” and
one for Ipoh in Malaysia, a smaller city, with a
population of half-a-million.

The loan for the Metropoiitan Water Intake Project (Seoul) underlines the Bank's concern about the
problems of environmental pollution in metropolitan
areas of developing member countries. The Project,
which was formulated in the wake of rver pollution
in Seoul, seeks to shift the source of raw water
upstream to a pollution-free area, Earlier in 1971 the
Bank made a loan to assist in the expansion and
improvement of Seoul's water supply system.

In dealing with environmental problems. the Bank
has cooperated with other international agencies. In
1972 the Bank agreed to act as Executing Agent of
the United Nations Development Programme for a
comprehensive environmental and water supply study
of Laguna de Bay in the vicinity of Manila

Whiie water supply and sewerage facilities should
be considered integral parts of public utility schemes.
most Governments and local institutions give lower
priority for sewerage because of the large investment
involved and the lower financial return. tis, however,
felt that with improved water suppiy systems in the
developing member countries, there wil! be a greater
incentive for introducing better sewerage facilities as
well. :
The Bank has made a modest start in this field by
requesting its consultants to study the existing sewerage facilities as part of technical assistance for two
water supply projects: one in Indonesia (Bardung)
and the other in Laos {Vientiane}.

Education

 

In the field of education, the Bank's emphasis has
been primarily on vocaiional training relevant to its
own lending and technical assistance activities. In
35 Bank projects covering 13 countries, on-the-job
training of personnel was a built-in feature. Virtually
all spheres of Bank assistanceâ€” agriculture, industry
development banks, transport, electric powerâ€” were
represented in such training programs.

Loans to Singapore in 1970 for the Ngee Ann
Technical Coflege and to the Republic of Korea in
1972 for the establishment of five vocational training
institutes, including a prototype training center,
carried a stage further the Bank's involvement in the
process of linking education and employment.

At the end of 1972 projects in an advanced stage
of consideration for Bank financing included the
construction and equipping of three Regional institutes for Skills Development and the upgrading of
four existing Technical Institutes in Thailand. In
addition, the Bank is also studying the vocational
education and training needs of certain of the smaller
and less developed member countries with a view
to considering furtner project activity in the future.

AFGHANISTAN: Technical Assistance
$48,500 for the Helmend Valley Development Road
Project ,

The Bank undertook the preparation of a feasibility
study of the proposed Helmand Valley Development
Road between Lashkargah and Deshu. Because of
increased agricultural production in the Helmand
Valley. considerable surpluses have to be transported
to markets in other parts of the country. The area
south of Lashkargah is without roads, a drawback
that has caused increased transport and production
costs.

With an estimated length of 200 kilometers,
the road would provide improved communication
between the centers of population and production in
much of the Upper Helmand Valley and the countryâ€™s
major transport and marketing facilities.

AFGHANISTAN: Technical Assistance
$263,000 for the Chakhansur Flood Control and
Development Project

Technical assistance is being provided for a
feasibility study of a flood control and regional development project in Chakhansur. one of the poorest
regions of Aighanistan.

In ancient times, the Chakhansur Province adjoining Iran and Pakistan was a food-surplus area
and supported a substantial population. This area,
where the Helmand River discharges into an inland
basin, has since deteriorated largely because of cyctes
of flood.and drought. It supports a dwindling population presently estimated at about 50.000.

The Chakhansur Flood Control and Development
Project is an attempt to change prevailing conditions
and facilitate economic development in this isolated
southwestern province. The Project, if found feasible
after the technical assistance, will cal! for the construction of two fload diversion dams to remove the
risk of flooding and open the way for agricultural
development at a comparatively low cost.

FIJI: Loan
$4,700,000 for the Power Supply Project

This was the Bank's first loan to Fiji, which
joined the Bank in 1970

The loan will finance part of the development of
the Fiji Electricity Authority's (FEA) power program
for the expansion and strengthening of existing power
facilities in northwest Viti Levu, which includes the
townships of Nandi and Lautoka and Nandi International Airport,

Scheduled to be completed by 3t July 1975, the
Project, together with work being undertaken separately by FEA, will provide sufficient generating
capacity to meet the forecast demand in the Nandi
and Lautoka areas until 1978. It will also provide

23Fiji: A diesct generator in operation at the Lautaka power house.

sufficient transmission capacity between Vunda and
Lautoka up to 71980 and between Vunda and Nandi
up to 1978.

By providing the power essential for development
of tourism and small industnes, the Project wil: help
create more job opporiunities, thereby contributing
to the improvement of Fiji's baiance of payments.
The Project will raise per capita power consumption
and enhance the welfare and living standards of the
population.

FiJt: Technical Assistance
$37,000 for the Fiji Development Bank (Extension)

Additional technical assistance to the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) will provide for an extension
of the services of two foreign experts to assist in the
teorganization of the FDB and the improvement of its
technical capability.

Under the origina! technical assistance approved
in 1971, a team of three experts was engaged for a
year to assist the FDB. However. it was considered
essential to provide the additional technicat assistance
to extend the work of the Senior Institutional Expert
by six months and the Financial Analyst by four
months.

This wilf ensure that the results of the teamâ€™s
training efforts are consolidated and that the FDB
will reach a tevel of proficiency that will enable it to
function efficientiy and effectively.

HONG KONG: Loan
$21,500,000 for the Sea Water Desalting Project

This was the Bank's first loan to Hong Kong since
if became a member in 1969.

Water supply has long been a serious problem
for Hong Kong. Due to inadequate reservoir storage
and rapid population growth, Hong -Kong has experienced successive water shortages since the end
of the second World War. In a bid to improve the
situation, the Government of Hong Kong has
prepared an overall water resources development
plan for the 1970â€™s on the assumption that the
Coionyâ€™s water consumption will continue to grow
at an annual rate of 8 per cent.

The plan requires, and the Government is proceed ing with, the development of two new water reservoil
schemes. However, there would still be a shortfall
in the capacity of the water supply system to meet the
demand from 1974. The desaiting plant will meet
rainimum requirements according to water demand
projections. With a capacity of 40 million imperial
gallons per day, the plant is the largest contemplated
so far in the world.

NEPAL: Loan
$2,700,000 {Special Funds) for the Gandak-Hetauda
Power Project

This was the Bankâ€™s first loan for power development in the country.

The Gandak Power Station is being constructed
and financed by the Government of india as part of a
large multi-purpose scheme intended to benefit both
countries.

The Project provides for the construction of
160 kilometers of transmission lines, consisting of two
sections from the Gandak Power Station to Bharatpur
and from Bharatpur fo Hetauda as well as necessary
substation facilities and the provision of consultant
services.

The Gandak Power Station is scheduled to commence production in Cctober 1973 and ail of its three
generating units are expectÃ©d to start operating in
mid-1974. However, the Central Nepal Power
System (CNPS) grid will be able to utilize power from
the station only after completion of the transmission lines to Hetauda, to be constructed as part of
the Bank Project.

The Project, when completed, will be operated
by the Nepal Electricity Corporation (NEC), a
Government-owned corporation responsible for producing and distributing electricity. To meet the

projected power demand for the continued commercial, industrial and population growth in the
Kathmandu Valley, NEC needs this additional capacity by 1976 to serve the valley and the rest of
the CNPS area.

$10,100,000 (Special Funds) for the HetaudaNarayangarh Road Project

The Hetauda-Narayangarh Road was constructed
in 1957 as a gravel access road to apen up the
Chitwan Valley for development. Erosion resulting
from heavy rainfall and the lack of adequate drainage
have brought about a substantial deterioration in
the road. Moreover, crossings on three major
rivers are flooded during the monsoon months
fromm June to September.

Near the western terminus of the road, the town
of Narayangarh is separated by the Narayani River
from the Nawalparasi District. A small cabieguided fery is available for crossing the Narayani,
but it has insufficient capacity to handle the traffic
projected for future years.

The Project consists of reconstruction and improvement of the 80-kilometer-long Hetauda-Narayangarh Road to an all-weather two-lane bitumen-surfaced standard, including construction of four
major two-lane bridges over the Rapti, Manahari,
Lothar and Narayani Rivers. The importance of the
road is enhanced by the fact that it forms a key portion

power to areas where supply is currently either inadequate or non-existent, thereby widening the
industrial base of Mindanao and stimulating economic development of the island.

PHILIPPINES: Loar
$22,250,000 for the Iligan-Cagayan de Oro-Butuan
Road Project

This Project provides for the construction and
improvement of the road starting at Marawi junction,
near tligan, passing through Cagayan de Oro
and ending in Ampayan, near Butuan, a total length
of 310 kilometers along the northern coastline of the
island of Mindanao.

The terrain through which the road. passes is
extremely varied. About one-third of its alignment
traverses hilly slopes and has sharp curves and steep
gradients that make it dangerous to negotiate, while
the remaining two-thirds passes through narrow
coastal plains with low embankments that are
highly susceptible to flooding.

A feasibility study, undertaken with the Bank's
technical assistance, recommended the upgrading
and improvement of this national road

The main benefits which are expected from the
Project are reductions in travel time and vehicle
operating costs, and the resultant transport cost
savings which, in turn, will have a significant
developmental effect on the economy of Northern
Mindanao.

PHILIPPINES: Technical Assistance
$183,000 for the Angat and Magai Irrigation
Projects .

The technical assistance will be for feasibility
studies including preliminary design work on the
existing Angat and Magat Irrigation Projects in
Central Luzon, the fargest island of the Philippines.

The studies will also assess the possibilities of an
integrated approach to agricultural development. If
implemented, the two projects would serve as pioneer
models for intensified irrigation projects throughout
the country.

The assistance follows earlier Bank technical
assistance to the Philippines in establishing a longterm water management improvement program in
National lrrigation Administration (NIA) systems.
Angat and Magat head the list of NIA priorittes for
implementation of the water management improvement program,

The Angat River Irrigation Systern was completed
in 1927 and presently has a potential irrigable area
of about 28,600 hectares. However, due to the
jack of water management facilities at the farm
level even after the completion of the Angat MultiPurpose Dam in 1966, it has only been possible to
irrigate 22,800 hectares in the wet season and 24,800
hectares in the dry season.

The Magat River Irrigation System is an area
with sufficient water and virgin land for greatly
increased agricultural production. The land currently
under irrigation, totalling 32,000 hectares in the wet
season and 22,000 hectares in the dry season,
could, after the improvement, be increased to
40,000 hectares in both seasons.

PHILIPPINES: Technical Assistance for the Laguna
de Bay Water Resources Development Study

The Bank has undertaken an integrated water
resources development study of Laguna de Bay as an
Executing Agent of the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP).

The Study has two componentsâ€”water quality
control and management, and the feasibility of a

hydraulic control structure and water supply plant
for the Greater Manila area

Laguna de Bay is in Luzon, the largest island

in the Philippines, and is one of the largest lakes ,

in Southeast Asia. It has not been used for water
supply or irrigation because of the high level of
salinity that results from the intrusion of sea water
in the dry season during periods of high tide in
Manila Bay.

Laguna de Bay is also contaminated by various
pollutants including industrial wastes, and thermal,
sewage and irrigation run-offs. More than half of the
sewage and industrial pollution is introduced by the
Pasig River with the remaining poliution originating
in the lake region.

The major economic benefit expected from the
water supply project, including the consiruction of the
hydraulic control. structure, will consist in the use of
the Laguna de*Bay to supply potable water io
Greater Manila for the period 1980-2000. Based on
the lowest expected annual inflow to the Lake, some
660 million gallons a day would be available and be
sufficient to meet the estimated requirements until
the year 2000.

As the Executing Agent, the Bank will be responsible for the overall supervision and implementation of the Study. The World Health Organization has
agreed to cooperate in an advisory capacity with the
Bank in the-execution of the public health, water
quality control and management components of
the Study. ,

The foreign. exchange cost of the Study
($1,284,300) will be borne by the UNDP and the
local currency cost by the Philippine Government.

PHILIPPINES: Technical Assistance
$31,000 for Tarlac-Santa Rosa Highway Study
The Tarlac-Santa Rosa Highway is one of the
highways and roads which were damaged by the
July-August 1972 floods in Central Luzon.
Approximately 41 kilometers long, the TarlacSanta Rosa Highway provides a connecting road
between Manila North Road and the Pan-PhilippineHighway. and also serves as a major feeder road to
these two important national highways.

A three-man consultant team in collaboration with
the Philippine Bureau of Public Highways, has made
the necessary field surveys to determine the extent
of the destruction caused to the sub-surface and
sub-structure of the roadway and bridges respectively.
and obtained cost estimates for their repair. The team
also reviewed the economic benefits of reconstructing
the road.

The Study will enable the Philippine Government
to decide on what further steps to take to meet the
long-term transportation needs of the area and to
minimize the interruptions that are caused annually
during the rainy season by floodwaters.

REGIONAL ACTIVITIES

During the year the Bank continued its role in
promoting regional cooperation in the region. Four
new projects were undertaken:

(i) A-study of the Asian Institute for Economic
Developrnent and Planning aimed at evaluating its activities and discerning possibilities
for inter-institutional cooperation between
the Bank and the Institute.

(ii) A contribution to the Third Project Feasibility
Study Training Course of the Asian Productivity Organization. Eleven member
countries in the region were expected to
benefit from the training course, which
seeks to improve the level of development
planning and project implemÃ©ntation

(iii) The preparation and operation of the
Regional Workshop on Irrigation Water
Management designed to maximize the
benefits from 13 .Bank-assisted irrigation
projects.

(iv) Technical assistance to Indonesia and
Malaysia for a Feasibility Study of the Trans
Malacca Strait Ferry Service between
Belawan in North Sumatra and Penang in
West Malaysia.

Asian institute for Economic Development
â€˜and Planning

The Asian Institute in Bangkok is engaged
primarily in the training of officials of regional
countries in the techniques of development planning
and in project analysis and management. The
Institute also has research functions and provides
advisory services as requested by regional countries.
Financial support has been provided largely by the
UNDP and ECAFE member countries.

tn response to a request by the Institute, the Bank
approved a study, estimated to cost $70,000, aimed
at evaluating its training and research programs, its
administrative and financial position, and at discerning
possibilities for cooperation between the Bank and
the Institute.

During 1972 a high-level study group was appointed to undertake the work. The report was due
for completion early in 1973

 

Asian Productivity Organization Training
Course

* The Bank agreed to contribute up to $30,000 to
the Asian Productivity Organization (APO) for its
Third Project Feasibility Study Training Course.
This will be carried out in two stages. Stage | was to
be held in Manila from 10-30 January 1973, concentrating on basic concepts and general principles
of preparing and assessing feasibility studies for the
various types of projects. Bank staff were to join the
APO personnel and other experts as speakers in thisâ€™
part of the Course. Stage I! was to be conducted in
Tokyo from 5-22 February 1973, concentrating on
case studies.

Preparations for both Stages | and |I of this Course
were completed this year by the APO in consultation
with the Bank. Thirty participants from government,
industrial and financial institutions in 12 Asian
countries have been selected to attend the Course.

Regional Workshop on Irrigation Water
Management
The Bank-sponsored Asian Agricultural Survey,

- published in 1968, and the Regianal Seminar on

Agriculture, held in 1969, identified the improvement
of water management as one of the prerequisites for
modernizing Asian agriculture and maximizing the
benefits of the Green Revolutionâ€

These findings have been borne in mind in
formulating Bank-assisted irrigation projects involving, as of 31 December 1972, 14 loans and 25
technical assistance programs with a total Bank
commitment of $60 million. As a result, many of the
Bank's irrigation projects involve some type of pilot

â€˜scheme under which farmers are given demonstration

and training in efficient water management and
modern farming techniques at the farm level. The
progress achieved in this regard has, however, been
varied. .
In order to help expedite the successful implementation of these projects and to standardize Bank
procedures for project formulation. the Bank approved
the holding of a Regional Workshop on Irrigation
Water Management, at an estimated cost of $48,000,
to take place from 14 August to 2 September. As
part of the Workshop program, it was proposed tooor aheemnererermeertentct errr armene ii rer tienen @ terete en Wea oh reer neem mt ng

Trans Strait of Malacca Ferry Service
Feasibility Study, Indonesia and Malaysia

The Bank has approved technical assistance to
Indonesia and Malaysia, at an estimated cost of
$40,000, for a feasibility study of a ferry service
across the Malacca Strait. The service would run

from Belawan near Medan in North Sumatra to
Penang in West Malaysia.

At present. a single ferry plies between the two
ports. However, preliminary investigations show that
the vessel, which is old, small and slow, needs
replacement if the service is to be brought to a
satisfactory standard.

The Study will determine the number. optinum
size and type of ferry vessels required. It will also
examine potential sites for ferry terminals and produce preliminary designs of these facilities.

It will also recommend the specific organizational
arrangements needed to operate the service efficiently
and will evaluate the general arrangements already
agreed to by the two Governments.

List of Regional Activities

By the end of the year, the Bank had undertaken 15 different regional activities as shown in the
Table.

Developments in regard to activities approved
prior to 1972, including action taken by the Governments concerned as follow-up to the Regional
Transport Survey of Southeast Asian countries, are
described below.

Regional Transport Survey

Important follow-up action on the Regional
Transport Survey of Southeast Asian countries, inaugurated by the Bank late in 1969 and completed
in 1971, was taken during the year.

The Report of the Survey laid special emphasis on
certain important institutional and policy changes
which had to accompany the recommended investment program. In relation particularly to regional
projects, the Report underlined the need for an
effective organization which could pursue implementation of such projects and waich their efficient
management. The Report recommended that these
functions be handled by the Secretariat of the
Coordinating Committee of Senior Transpor: Officials
of Southeast Asian countries which would have to
be suitably strengthened.

As a result of the recommendations made by the
Coordinating Committee, the participating Governments convened a meeting of the Ministers of
Transport in Kuala Lurnpur in May 1972 to consider,
among other matters. follow-up action on the
Survey. The following extract from the Joint
Communique issued at the conclusion of the
Ministersâ€™ meeting presents the decisions taken in
regard to follow-up action on the Survey:

â€œNoting that the Regional Transport Survey
embodies a massive agenda of the national and
regionat measures required for transportation to
effectively contribute to accelerated economic
development in and integration of the region, the
Ministerial Conference agreed that:

(i) member Governments be urged to give

4546

fullest consideration to the incorporation of
recommendations of the Survey into the
national development plans of their respective countries;

(ii) the Coordinating Committee of Southeast
Asian Senior Officials on Transport and
Communications (COORDCOM) determine
in detail and in consultation with member
Governments concerned the feasibility and
benefits of the various regional projects,
policy and institutional recommendations in
the Regional Transport Survey and the
steps which should be taken for their
planning and implementation;

(iii) COORDCOM accord priority attention to
those projects relating to the pooling of
information, research and training facilities,
caordination of transport services, standardization of equipment and harmonization
of action in respect of bilateral agreements
with outside interests in the transport field;

{iv} COORDCOM take steps to promote imple
mentation of those projects where feasibility .

studies have been completed and projects
which require expansion of capacity by
1976;

{v) COORDCOM keep under continuous review
the perspective of the Regional Transport
Survey and recommend on the project,
poticy and institutional implications involved
80 as to enable the Survey to serve as a
basis for the continuing efforts of the
region in transport development.â€

An important decision taken at the Ministersâ€™
Conference was â€œto establish a Permanent Secretariat
of the Coordinating Committee with responsible
officials as soon as possible.â€ The Secretariat known
as the Southeast Asian Agency for Regional Transport and Communications (SEATAC) has since been
established in Kuala Lumpur. The SEATACâ€™s main
functions are: (i) identification and promotion of
high priority regional transport programs and projects,
(ii) facilitation of cooperative efforts on the part of
member Governments in the implementation of
regional projects and (iii) maintenance of up-to-date
information on regional transport.

The SEATAC is in the process of recruiting its
nucleus staff. In due course, it will have a technical
wing which will include a few professional experts
to work on specific projects and programs. The
SEATAC will seek assistance from bilateral and
raultilateral sources for financing the cost of some
of the professional experts.

The SEATAC has already commenced discussions
with individual Governments on the current status
of the projects identified by the Regional Transport
Survey and the further follow-up action needed on

these projects. The SEATAC will maintain close
contact with the Bank.

Qn the Bank's part. action is being pursued in
consuliation with the Governments to discuss
specific projects identified by the Survey. Loan
assistance has already been extended for a number
of projects. These inctude Singapore. Airport,
Tandjung Priok Port (Indonesia), Kuala LumpurKarak Highway (Malaysia), Surabaja Port (Indonesia)
and Penang Airport (Malaysia).

Coconut tndustry Study

The Study of the Coconut Industry in the Bank's
region commenced in January 1972 and field work
was completed by two consultants in September
1972 covering the following countries: Fiji. india,
Indonesia. Laos, Malaysia; Papua New Guinea, the
Philippines, Singapore. Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tonga,
the Republic of Viet-Nam and Western Samoa.

The final draft of the Report is expected to be
completed early in 1973. The Report is divided into
three parts. The first part presents an overall view of
the industry in the region. Common problems are
examined and general recommendations made for
possible sciution to these problems. The second
part, deals with individual country reports. Relevant
aspects of the coconut industry in each country are
studied in order to uncover specific bottlenecks in
achieving the maximum exploitation of the vartous
products of the coconut tree and specific recommendations made for overcoming them. The third
part atternpts to identify projects which may be
suitable for financing by national entities in each
countiy, regional and international development
banks, and other organizatians. On a tentative basis,
ten projects are identified.

Asian Industrial Survey

The Asian Industrial Survey for Regional Cooperation. a project sponsored by the Econdmic
Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) in
cooperation with the Bank and other bilateral and
multilaterai aid agencies. continued as scheduled.
Stages | and Il of the Study were completed during
the year, and the final report is expected to be completed in April 1973. The Bank was represented at
the Second Consultative Committee for the Survey
held in Bangkok in September 1972, which reviewed
progress reports and future plans of the Study Team.

Aimed at identifying industrial projects to be
implemented on a regional basis, the Survey covers
the following countries: Indonesia, the Khmer Republic, the Republic of Korea, Laos, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore. Sri Lanka, Thailand and the
Republic of Viet-Nam.:

LAWASIA Credit and Security Research Project

The Credit and Security Research Project undertaken by the Law Association for Asia and the
Western Pacific (LAWASIA) continued during 1972.

The Project involves a study of credit and security Â©

arrangements available to national development
banks and similar financial institutions. The Bank
has provided financial assistance, technical advice
and administrative assistance to the LAWASIA for the
implementation of the Project. The Ford Foundation
has also provided financial assistance.

The countries covered by the Study are Australia,
the Republic of China, Indonesia, Japan, the Repubtic
of Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and
Thailand. The Project, substantially completed in
1972, will produce nine individual country. reports
and one integrated report. :

Development Banks Conferenceâ€” Follow-Up

A study regarding the training facilities for
development banks in the Bank's developing member
countries was completed in 1971. The Report was
discussed by a panel of experts from development

 

banks in the region and selected international
institutions tn Manila in mid-March. The Panel made
two main recommendations with direct implications
for the Bank:

{1) a Training Assistance Unit (TAU) should be
established within the Bank with coordinating
and training assistance functions; and

(2) the Bank should provide practical assistance
and such financial assistance as may be
considered appropriate to supplement the
resources and efforts of industrial development banks in implementing their individual
training programs. The Bank has accepted the
recommendations of the pane! and, as a first
step, the TAU is in the process of being set up.

The Bank plans to convene the Fifth Regional

Conference of Development Banks of Asia in the
second half of 1973. In addition to discussing
developments in implementing the recommendations
made at the Fourth Conference, the Fifth Conference
will examine ihe subject â€œOperational Experiences
of Development Banksâ€” Problems Encountered in
the Promotion of Industria} Development.â€

RELATIONS WITH OTHER
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

During the year, the Bank further strengthened its
ties with its sistÃ©r institutions â€”ihe World Bank and
other regional development banksâ€”and also the
United Nations and its various organs and specialized
entities. A notable development was the arrangement
entered into early in the year with the World Bank,
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
and the Mekong Committee whereby the Bank will
function as an executing authority for pioneer agricultural projects in the Mekong area.

Whenever practicable, the Bank has participated
in meetings and conferences, where these have been
of direct concern to its activities, organized by other
international organizations.

Relationships with institutions with which the
Bank maintained regular contact during 1972 are
summarized in the following paragraphs.

Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)

The Bank has.been in contact with the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAQ) in agriculture, fishing
and forestry fields. In accordance with the interim
arrangements for cooperation established in 1968,
the annual consultation with the FAQ took place in
Rome in April. The Bank sent a representative to
participate in the National Seminar on Water Management in Bangkok in March and also in the Fourth
Session of Asia and the Far East Commission on Agricultural Statistics in Seoul in October. FAQ experts
have been invited as consultants to join in Bank
missions as well as in project implementation.

International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development {IBRD}

The working relationship with the World Bank has
become closer with the intensification of the Bank's
operational activities. Frequent visits, consultations
and exchange of information took place during the
year with regard to operational policies and practices,
financing of individual projects and country economic
developments.

Observers from the Bank attended during the year
the aid coordinating meetings sponsared by the
World Bank for the Republic of Korea, Pakistan, the

Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand. A Bank Tepresentative participated in the World Bank seminar on
Loan Disbursement Procedures in Tokyo in June.

Another step toward closer cooperation between
the two institutions has been the arrangement
finalized in October for the reciprocal exchange of
documents.

The Bank's association with the World Bank in
the Mekong Basin activities is described in the section
below entitled â€œMekong Committee.â€

Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research

Members of this Group, in addition to the Bank,
include governments, international institutions and
private foundations. The Group's Technical Advisory
Committee met twice in the year and a meeting of the
Consultative Group itself took place in November.

The Bank has not to date, committed any funds
to the five centers already being supported by the
Group, some of which are outside the Asian region,
(t has, however, followed with interest the Groupâ€™s
discussions on the future work of the International
Rice Research Institute in the Philippines; the
possibility of the Group lending support to the Asian
Vegetable Research and Development Center (already
supported by the Bank): and to the establishment of
an International Crop Research Institute for SemiArid Tropics to be located in India.

international Labour Organisation (ILO}

Following the participation of a Bank consultant
in the Comprehensive Employment Strategy Mission
to Sri Lanka sponsored by the International Labour
Organisation (ILO) in 1971, exchange of information
and views was undertaken between the ILO and the
Bank during the year in regard to areas of mutual
interest. particularly the employment strategy missions
of the ILO to several regional developing member
countries of the Bank.

Mekong Committee
The year 1972 saw the commencement of detailed
preparation of a program of pioneer agriculturalStahsedeeeeenensiemeeetetemmnemeemienmememenenmeinmeienemeamamereasmmameriame name ieee

projects in the Lower Mekong Basin, for which a
Fund amounting to $2.04 million was established
under the auspices of the United Nations Development Programme. A â€œMemorandum of Understandingâ€ for the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP} Regiona! Project (REG 253) was signed by
the UNDP, the World Bank, the Bank and tne Mekong
Committee on 11 January. Within this framework, the
Bank became the delegated executing agency of the
World Bank for the preparation of the Go Cong
Pioneer Agricultural Project in the Repubtic of VietNam and of the Casier Sud Pioneer Agricultural
Project in Laos.

For the Go Cong Project, the Bank approved
technical assistance in September and consultants
started field work late in Octoper. A fact-finding
mission visited Laos to prepare a technical assistance
paper for the Casier Sud Project in December. The
World Bank, jointly with the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO}, is preparing a further seven or
eight projects in the Khmer Republic, the Republic of
Viet-Nam and Northeast Thailand. Budget commitments reached $832,000â€”out of the total fund of
$2.04 millionâ€”by the end of 1972.

Two informal high level meetings on the Mekong
development program were held during the year, in
Bangkok in March, and in New York and Washington,
D.C., in May. Two inter-agency meetings at the
staff level were held in Bangkok in January and
October, and two technical meetings were held in
Nongkai. Thailand, in June and in Bangkok in
October. The Bank sent representatives to these
meetings and actively participated in the discussions
with the World Bank, the UNDP, the FAO, the
Mekong Committee and other agencies. One of the
major items of discussion was the World Bank's
Review Reports on Mekong Basin Development
which were completed in February, after two-and-ahalf years of study. The World Bank has also initiated
two â€˜grantâ€™ funds, namely the Construction Fund
and the Program Monitoring Fund for the pioneer
agricultural projects, as a second step toward their
implementation.

â€˜Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development {OECD}

Since its inception, the Bank has maintained a
continuing interest in the efforts of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) toward fostering international cooperation
and research an matters relating to the needs for and
flows of development assistance. In August this year.
the Bank was represented at the International Meeting
of Directors of Development Research and Training
Institutes held in Belgrade. The meeting, the eighth
of its kind, was organized jointly by the OECD Development Center. the World Bank and the Yugoslav
Institute of Investment Research. Three topics of

current interest, namely, multi-level planning and
decentralized decision-making, income caistribution
and employment, and foreign private investment
were discussed in separate committees at the meeting.
A plenary session was also held on the problem of
international cooperation among development institutes.

Regional Development Banks

The third informa! meeting of the three principat
regional development banksâ€”-the African. the Asian
and the Inter-Americanâ€”and the Worid Bank was
held in September in Washington, D.C.

Mr. Antonio Ortiz Mena, President of the InterAmerican Development Bank, acted as Chairman.
Among the topics discussed were (i) the linking of
the International Monetary Fundâ€™s Special Drawing
Rights to development assistance financing, (ii)
human environmental matters and (iit) possible new
forms of cooperation and coordinatian between the
World Bank and the regional development banks.

The next meeting of the group will be held in
Nairobi, at the time of the Annual Meetings of the
World Bank Group in September 1973.

United Nations Development Programme
{UNDP}

The Bank has continuously maintained close
working relations with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) within the framework of
the informal arrangements for regular consultations
and exchange of information which were instituted
in 1869. The establishment of a Regional Bureau for
Asia and the Far East (located in New York) under
the restructuring of the UNDP in 1971 has facilitated
the cooperation between the two institutions. The
Bank has been given the opportunity to review and
comment on the UNDP country and inter-country
programs, and new requests from governments for
pre-invesiment assistance. The UNDP and its
resident representatives have been kept informed

about the Bank's loan and technical assistance .

operations,

The Bank was represented at the regional meeting
of the UNOP resident representatives for Asia and
the Far East held in Bangkok in March and also at the
Twelfth South Pacific Conference in Apia, Western
Samoa, in September at which the UNDP mission
report on the proposed South Pacific Regional
Development Bank was discussed.

Cooperation with the UNDP entered a new field
during the year when the Bank agreed to act as the
Executing Agent for the Laguna de Bay Water
Resources Development Study in the Philippines and
also as the delegated Executing Agency of the World
Bank for the Go Cong Pioneer Agricultural Project in
the Republic of Viet-Nam in both of which UNDP
funds are being employed.

United Nations Economic Commission for Asia
and the Far East (ECAFE)

During the year, the Bank continued to maintain
its close working relationship with the. Economic
Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) on
matters of mutual concern. As already mentioned,
the Bank is cooperating with the ECAFE on the Asian
Industsial Survey and has undertaken a special â€˜study
of the Asian Institute for Economic Development and
Planning. which was created under a resolution of
the ECAFE and for which the ECAFE retains certain
administrative responsibilities.

in addition to its involvement in the foregoing
studies, the Bank was represented at several ECAFEsponsored meetings, including the 28th Session of
the ECAFE held in Bangkok during March. The other
meetings in which the Bank participated included the
Committee on Industry and Natural Resources, the
Conference of Asian Statisticians, conferences for
the Establishment of an Asian Reserve Bank, Expert
Group Meetings on Multinational Export Credit
Insurance, Progress Evaluation during the Second
United Nations Development Decade, the Second
Asian Population Conference, and the Sub-Committee Meeting on Energy Resources and Electric
Power. As in previous years, the Bank provided
lecturers at the Asian Statistical Institute in Tokyo.

United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO)

Views were exchanged with the representative
of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization during the Bankâ€™s Annual
Meeting in Vienna with regard to projects, particularly
in the field of vocational education, for possible
cooperation between the two institutions. This was
followed by contact between Bank staff and
UNESCO officials at the Bangkok regicnal office of
the UNESCO on various matters concerning the
Bank's ongoing activities in this field.

United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD)

The Bank appreciates the efforts of the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) in promoting cooperation on matters
relating to trade between the developed and developing countries, and particularly among developing
countries within a region. In this connection, the
Bank was represented at the Third Conference held
during April and May at Santiago, Chile.

The Bank's representative participated in Working
Group Ii of the Second Committee which discussed
important issues on trade expansion, Ã©conomic cooperation and regional integration among developing
countries.pense - .

ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES

There were several important developments in
4972 which affected the Bankâ€™s ordinary capital
resources. There was an increase in the authorized
and subscribed capital of the Bank as well as in its
membership. Several member currencies including
the United States dollar underwent changes in their
foreign exchange value. The Bank raised additional
funds through borrowings in capital markets and
through sales of participations in the early maturities
of its loans. There was an increase in the volume of
funds invested pending their use in operations.
During the course of the year the Bank adopted the
United States dollar with a gold content of 0.818513
gram of fine gold as the unit of account; a new liquidity
policy was also adopted.

New Members

Tonga became a member of the Bank on 29
March, subscribing to six shares valued at $65,144;
the paid-in portion of Tonga's subscription is payable in five equal annual instalments, the first of
which was paid on 10 March.

The Board of Governors approved on 11 Novernber
Resolution No. 54 admitting Bangladesh to the
Bank's membership with a subscription of 1,500
shares, valued at $16,285,714; the paid-in portion
of this subscription is also payable in five equal
annual instalments, Bangladesh is in the process of
completing the requisite formalities for such membership.

Subscriptions to Original Capital

At the end of the year total subscriptions to the
original authorized capital stock of the Bank amounted
to $7,091.620,570

Total subscriptions in convertible currencies paid
under Article 6.2(a) of the Articles of Agreement
amounted to the equivalent of $269,844,514. Total
subscriptions paid under Article 6.2(b) in membersâ€™
own currencies or in the form of promissory notes or
similar obligations also amounted io the equivalent
of $269,844,514; of the subscriptions paid under
Article 6.2(b), convertible currency funds amounted
to the equivalent of $185,698,400.

Increase in the Bank's Capital

As mentioned in the previous Annual Report, the
Board of Governors adopted Resolution No. 46 in
November 1971 authorizing an increase of 165,000
shares in the capital stock of the Bank. The resolution
specified that the capital increase would become
effective when subscriptions in accordance with the
Resolution aggregated at least 400,000 shares.
During the course of 1972. several members took
steps to complete their subscriptions to the increase
and, with the subscriptions by 22 members aggregating 102,492 shares valued at $1,112,770,287, the
Resolution becarne effective on 23 November 1972.

The Resolution provides for an increase of 150
per cent in the capital originally subscribed by
individual members; 80 per cent of the increase is
callable and 20 per cent is paid-in and is payable in
three equal instalments on or before 6 April in each
of the years 1973, 1974 and 1975.

Recognizing that for certain countries which
became members after 1966, these due dates would
involve a double burden because of the continuing
payments by such members against their original
capital subscriptions, the Board of Directors recommended and the 8oard of Governors approved on
9 November (Resolution No. 53) a special arrangement allowing the affected members to exercise an
option, on or before 28 February 1973, to make
payments of the paid-in portion of their subscriptions
to the increase in the capital in two equal instalments
on or before 6 April 1975 and 6 April 1976.

As mentioned above, total subscriptions to the
increase in capital amounted to $1,112,770.287; of
this amount the callable portion is 80 per cent Le.
$890,209.715 and the paid-in portion is 20 oer cent
i.e. 8$222-666-752< No payments under the capital
inctease had been made up to the end of 1972.

Changes in Exchange Rates

As mentioned in the last Annual Report. the year
1971 witnessed the temporary suspension by the
United States of full convertibility of the dollar into
gold and actions by several members of the Bank
permitting their currencies to float in the international
exchange markets. On 17-18 December 1971, the

6152

â€œGroup of Tenâ€ reached an agreement on a pattern
of exchange rate relationships among their currencies.
Taking note of this agreement, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) established a temporary regime
during which a member of the IMF could permit the
exchange rate for its currency to move within a wider
margin of 24 per cent on either side of the par value
or of a newly established rate called the central rate.
Certain other members outside of the â€˜Group of Tenâ€
also established central rates for their currencies.

On 8 May 1972 the United States formally
devalued the dollar establishing a new par value with
the IMF at 38 dollars per ounce of fine gold. Effective

23 June 1972, the United Kingdom allowed the

pound sierling to float; as @ consequence, some
member currencies which were pegged to the pound
sterling also floated. Other members of the Bank
established new par values or provisiona! rates for
their currencies during the year or continued with
central rates established for their currencies in 1971.

Recognizing the current temporaty regime in the
international monetary system and the continued
applicability of central rates for currencies of several
members, the Bank's Board of Directors adapted on
31 August 1972 the policy on exchange rates to be
used for translation of currencies and maintenance
of value under Article 25.

Briefly, the effect of the Resolution is that where a
Member currency has a par value, central rate,
provisional rate or some other rate previously adopted
by the Bank for translation purposes, and foreign
exchange transactions in the territory of the concerned
member are generally conducted on the basis of such
rate, the Bank will use that rate for translation
purposes,

Maintenance of value adjustment will be made
under Article 26 whenever there is a change in such
rate, and. settlement of maintenance of value
obligations on the basis of such adjustment will be
effected within a reasonable time. For all other
member currencies, the Bank will use for translation
and maintenance of value adjustment purposes an
exchange rate which, in the opinion of the Bank,
after consultation with the IMF, represents from time
to time a realistic foreign exchange value of such
currency.

in the case of developing members with nonconvertible currencies, the Bank, if so requested by
them, will agree to defer action relating to translation
of their currencies and maintenance of value adjustment on the basis of such realistic foreign exchange
value of their currencies provided arrangements
satisfactory to the Bank are made, in respect of the
portions of such currencies required for use by the
Bank, to avoid any adverse effects which would
otherwise be sustained by the Bank by reason of such
deferment.

During the latter part of the year. the Bank took
action for necessary implementation of the aforementioned Resolution and in several cases maintenance of value settlements as necessary have
already been effected.

Unit of Account

Until the formai devaluation of the United States
dollar on 8 May 1972, the Bank maintained its
accounts in terms of the United States dollar of the
weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966 i.e.
0.888671 gram of fine gold, the value of the United
States dollar used for defining the Bank's capital in
Article 4.1 of the Articles of Agreement. With effect
from 8 May 1972. the Bank adoptec the United
States dollar with a gald content of 0.818513 gram of
fine gold as the Bank's unit of account. Consequently,
the capital stock of the Bank was restated reflecting
an increase of 8.571428 per cent in the capital
stock expressed earlier in terms of the United States
dollar as defined in the Bank's Articles of Agreement.
An important effect of such restatement of the Bank's
capital stock. as also of the re-translation of other
currencies in terms of the Bank's unit of account, has
been a net charge of $5,768,477 against the Ordinary
Reserve of the Bank.

Borrowings

During the year, three new bond issues were
arranged in Luxembourg. Japan and Italy aggregating
the equivalent of $58.6 million. The Bank's total
borrewings up to the end of 1972 amounted to the
equivalent of $230.6 million and were denominated
in eight currencies, namely Austrian schillings.
Belgian francs, Deutsche marks, Italian lires, Japanese
yens, Luxembourg francs, Swiss francs and United
States dollars.

Tne first issue of the year was in Luxembourg and
took place in April when Lux F 400 million ($8.9
million) of 63 oer cent 15-year bonds were sold
at par to be redeemed in equal annual instalments
commencing in 1978. The issue was underwritten by
a syndicate headed by Kredietbank S.A. Luxembourgeoise and the bonds are fisted on the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange. This is the first issue in a country
which is not a member of the Bank.

In April the Bank made its third issue in Japan. The
issue was for an amount of Â¥10 billion ($32.5 million)
of 7.3 per cent 10-year bonds at par with redemption
commencing in 1978. The managing underwriters
for this issue were The Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.,
The Daiwa Securities Co., Ltd., The Nikko Securities
Co,, Ltd., and Yamaichi Securities Co., Ltd.

The third borrowing in 1972 took place in the
(talian capital market in October and was the Bank's
first issue in Italy. The issue, in the amount of Lire
10 billion ($17.2 million) bearing interest at the rate|
|
|

 

of 7 per cent, was priced at 98 per cent. It will be
redeemed in equal annual instalments over the years
1978 to 1987. The issue was arranged by the Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro and placed privately.

Loan Participations

The Bank usually seeks participations in its
project loans made from ordinary capital resources
through sale of portions of loans maturing during the
earlier years. Participations, which are sought from
commercial banks and other institutions at the same
rate of interest as is charged to borrowers, do not
carry the Bank's guarantee of repayment by borrowers.

Participations in loans approved by the Bank in
1972 amounted to $6.860 miliion in sight loans,
which â€˜brought cumulative loan participations to
$13.560 million in 20 loans. As of the end of 1972
an aggregate amount of $491 miltion had been
collected under these participations and disbursed
to borrowers, and an amount of $1.775 million had
been repaid on maturity to participants out of repayments received from borrowers.

Encashment of Demand Notes

Pursuant to: the findings of the Board of Directors
contained in. their report to the Board of Governors
recommending an increase in the Bank's capital,
arrangements were made in the early par: of 1972 to
encash a part of the demand promissory notes or
similar obligations representing the national currency
portion of subscriptions of members to the original
paid-in capital which are not subject to restrictions
under Article 24.2 of the Articles of Agreement. At
the end of the year the proceeds of such encashment
amounted to the equivalent of $42,243,935. The
encashment of the remaining demand promissory
hotes or simifar obligations envisaged in 1973 and
1874 may need to be reconsidered as 4 consequence
of the adoption by the Bank of a new Liquidity
Policy (see next column).

Investments

At the end of the year the Bank's investments
were held in 19 convertible currencies and in one
non-convertible currency, totalling the equivalent of
$444,230,714 of which 27 per cent was held in
government securities or government-guaranteed
obligations of member countries and 73 per cent in
time deposits or certificates of deposit of banks in
member countries and with the Bank for International
Settlements.

Of the total investments in government securities
of government-guaranteed obligations of members,
47 per cent was invested in securities maturing within
one year and 53 per cent was invested in securities
maturing after one year; of the total investments in
time deposits or certificates of deposits of banks in
member countries and with the Bank for International
Settlements, 74 per cent was invested in deposits
maturing within one year and 26 per cent was invested in deposits maturing after one year.

Liquidity Policy

During the year 1972, the Bank examined its
liquidity position in the light of disbursements under
loans made from ordinary capital resources: such
disbursements were occurring at a slower pace than
that originally projected. In view of ihe resulting
substantial time-lag between loan commitments and
disbursements, it was not considered essential for
the Bank to adhere to the full commitment coverage
policy. At the same time it was recognized that the
Bank's efforts to establish itself firmly as a major
borrower in the principal capital markets must continue. In the light of these considerations, the liquidity
policy adopted by the Bank in 1972 provides for
maintaining the Bankâ€™s liquid assets at not less than
two-thirds of three yearsâ€™ projected loan disbursements. This policy is subject to annual reviews, the
first of which is contemplated early in 1973.

Income and Expenditure

The grass income for the year amounted to
$33,371,263. After deducting commissions appropriated to Special Reserve amounting to $973,498,
the unappropriated income for the year was
$32,397,765.

Administrative expenses for the year totalled
$9.551,487, from which $3,945,000 was deducted
and charged to Special Funds resources as Administration Charge to Special Operations. The
total net adrninistrative expenses attributable to
ordinary operations for 1972 were therefore
$5,606,487.

In addition, services to member countries during
the year. excluding $1.251,055 charged to the
Technical Assistance Special Fund, amounted to
$1.164,.217. Total financial expenses were
$14,442,588.

The gross expenses for the year were therefore
$21,213,292; net income was. $11,184,473. The
net income is available for allocation by the Board of
Governors in accordance with the provisions of
Article 40.1.SPECIAL FUNDS

Restructuring and Mobilization

An outstanding feature of the year's activities was
the sharp increase in concessional loans made by the
Bank frorn its Special Funds resources. The amount
of such loans made in 1972 was $94,340,000. The
corresponding amounts for 1969, 1970 and 1971
were $22,005,000. $33,693,000 and $51,510,000
respectively. The successive increases inthe Bank's
concessional /ending over the past four years clearly
demonstrate the growing importance of this aspect
of the Bank's operations, and the need to carry on
such tending on an increasing scale in the future if
the Bank is to be responsive to the reasonabie needs
of its developing member countries.

The abitity of the Bank to answer this challenge
depends, however, upon Special Funds resources
being made available to it in amounts and upon terms
appropriate for the purpose. By the end of 1972,
the margin between available resources and cumulative loan approvals had narrowed 1o little more than
$20,000,000. \t is apparent that immediate steps
must be taken to increase the amount of resources
available for concessional lending. It is also apparent
that, if the Bank is to maintain en appropriate program
for such lending, it must be assured that resources
will be forthcoming on an organized and regular
basis. and in an amount sufficient to cover lending
requirements over a reasonable period of years.

Recognizing these problems, the Bank began a
study early in 1972 of the whole of its existing Special
Funds structure and procedures for resource mobilization. The Bank is at present administering two
Special Funds which are available for loan financing:
the Agricultural Special Fund, and the Multi-Purpose
Special Fund. Contributions to these Funds have,
in the past, been made on a bilateral basis at the
initiative of individual contributions. The terms of
such bilateral contributions nave varied from contibution to contribution, with the result that the
administration of the resources and their deployment
in loan operations have become increasingly difficult.

The Bank has now formulated preliminary proposals for a restructuring of Special Funds. These
envisage the creation of a single unified Fund,
multilateral in character and governed by uniform
and liberal terms and conditions. The resources of the

Fund would be pooled, and would be available for
use by the Bank as required to carry out its concessional lending policies and program. Such resources would be mobilized and replenished at
tegular intervals, on an organized basis, by contributions from developed member countries of the
Bank. Â°

One feature of the restructuring would be the
winding up, with the consent of the concerned
contributors, of the existing Agricultural Special
Fund, and a consolidation of resources of both the
Agricultural and Multi-Purpose Funds in the proposed
new Fund. This does not reflect any lessening of the
Bank's interest in agricultural development in the
region. Rather, it is considered that since the total
amount of concessional lending for such development
already made by the Bank far exceeds the total
tesources of the Agricultural Fund, the Fund has
effectively fulfilled its intended function.

Alt these proposals are at present under review by
the Bankâ€™s Board of Directors and by its member
countries. In September 1972, a meeting was held in
Washington, D.C., with representatives of all but one
of the Bankâ€™s developed member countries, to discuss
the proposed restructuring and replenishment program. The participants in the meeting expressed
broad support in principle for the Bank's proposals.
In December, member countries participating in the
Seventh Ministerial Conference for the Economic
Development of Southeast Asia endorsed the proposal to wind-up the Agricultural Fund and to
establish a unified Special Fund.

In November, the Bank appointed Sir John
Chadwick as Specia! Advisor to the President of the
Bank with responsibility for assisting in the establishment of an effective resource mobilization program.

The Bank, for its part, is studying the possibility of
setting aside further amounts for concessional lending
from the paid-in capital. The amount which can be
set aside within the limits prescribed by the Articles
of Agreement is. however, relatively small. In the
meantime, the Bank proposes to maintain the pace
of project preparation and appraisal work so that
Specia! Funds loans may be made in suitable cases
without further delay, as and when additional funds
become available.Resources the Multi-Purpose Speciai Fund, in @ total amount

57ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION

President

On 26 November Mr. Shiro Inoue assumed the
Presidency of the Bank for the remaining four years of
the second term of Mr. Takeshi Watanabe, who resigned as of 24 Novernber.

Mr. Inoue, formerly Executive Director concurrently Representative for International Affairs of
the Bank of Japan; was unanimously elected President
of the Bank on 31 August by the Board of Governors,

On 23 November the Board of Directors expressed
its appreciation of the services of the outgoing
President, Mr. Takeshi Watanabe, and adopted the
following resolution by acclamation:

â€œThe Board of Directors

RESOLVES

To express to Mr. Takeshi Watanabe, ai the
conclusion of his service as President of the Bank
and Chairman of the Board of Directors, its deep
appreciation of his outstanding and dedicated role
in the formation and early development of the Bank
and for the inspiring leadership, wisdom, sincerity
and understanding with which he has guided the

Board of Directors over the period November 1966

to November 1972."

Staff

The Bank increased its staff by 16 professional
and 21 non-proiessional staff members in the course
of the year. By the end of 1972, the Bank staff
(excluding President and Vice-President) consisted
of 207 professional staff and 382 non-professional
staff, representing 34 nationalities.

Headquarters

The Philippine Coordinating Committee con-~

tinued to function as an effective liaison agency
between the Bank and Philippine Government
authorities. Mr. Cornelio Balmaceda, Chairman of the
Philippine Coordinating Committee from its inception, resigned from the Committee in June. -Throughout his association with the Committee, he rendered
valuable assistance to the Bank. He was succeeded
for brief periods in acting capacities by Executive
Secretary Alejandro Melchor, Jr. and Mr. Antonio
Locsin. The present Acting Chairman is Assistant
Executive Secretary Roberto V. Reyes.

It had previously been reported that, in accordance
with its obligations contained in the Headquarters
Agreement, the Philippine Government was constructing a headquarters seat for the Bank. The
building was completed during the latter part of the
year and the Bank's offices were transferred to the
headquarters seat at the end of October. Originally,
it was: intended that part of the complex would be
occupied by the local offices of the United Nations.
However, the entire complex is now to be made
available to the Bank, thus providing additional space
for future expansion.

On 18 November, the building was inaugurated
by His Excellency Ferdinand â‚¬. Marcos, President of
the Philippines, in a ceremony held under the auspices
of the Philippine Coordinating Committee with the
First Lady, Mrs. Imeida Romualdez Marcos, cutting
the ceremonial ribbon. During this inaugural ceremany, President Marcos formally turned over ta the
Bank the use and occupancy of the building.

The new building is impressive both from
architectural and functional viewpoints. The main
portion of the building contains 15 floors including a
basement and sub-basement. Apart from office
accommadation and other facilities there is a library,
an auditorium, a cafeteria and dining rooms in the
building.

The appearance of the interior of the building has
been made more attractive with works of art
generously donated by many member countries. Â©

ht is satisfying to note that, as a result of the
generosity of the host government, the Bank personnel have now the advantage and convenience of all
being located in a single building.

Budget for 1973

The budget for 1973 was approved by the Board
of Directors on 17 November 1972 and a summary
thereof appears in Appendix 2. Internal Administrative Expenses are estimated at $10,663,700' and

with the international Monetary Fund as of that date.

Translation of Currencies

Prior to 30 June 1972 amounts in currencies other than United
States Dollars were translated into United States Dollars adjusted.
from 8 May 1972, to reflect the change in the par value of the
United States Dollar:

(a) In the cases of members which had par values estabiished
or provisional rates for bookkeeping puxposes agreed with
the International Monetary Fund, at such par values or
provisional rates,

(b) In the cases of the remaining members, at the rates useo dy
them in making payments of capital subscriptions to the
Bank.

in view of the continuation of the temporary tegime under which
foreign exchange transactions have been generally conducted in
the territories of a number of members at central rates or floating
rates for their respective currencies. effective 30 June 1972 the
Board of Directors approved the use of appropriate central rates
and floating tates for purposes of translation of currencies and
maintenance of value of the Bank's holdings of mamber currencies
under Article 25 of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank. As of
31 December 1972. amounts in currencies other than United
States Dollars were translated at the following rates:

(a) In the cases of 18 members (Afghanistan, Australia, Republic
of China, Franca, Indonesia, Khmer Republic, Republic of
Korea, Laos, Malaysia. Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua
New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand,
and Republic of Viet-Nam). at par values established oF
provisional rates for bookkeeping purposes agreed by these
members with the International Monetary Fund. excepting

Samoa), at the raies used by these members in making
payments of capital subscriptions to the Bank.

No representation is made that any currency held by the Bank is
covertible into any other currency at the rate or rates specified
above.

The net effect of the adoption of central rates and floating rates
for purposes of translation of currencies has been to increase, in
terms of Unined States Dollars, assets and â€˜iabilities without
material effect on net income for the year.

On 17 September 1968, the Board of Direciors adopted the Special

Special Funds Resources, pursuant to Article 19, paragraph 4. These
Rules and Regulations provide for an Agricuitural Special Fund, a

or accept. Contributions mase by convibutors before the adoption of
the Special Funds Rules and Regulations and thereafter have been
accepted in terms of Article 19. paragraph 1 (ii) and have oeen allocated
to the relevant Special Fund in accordance with the Special Funds
Rules and Regulations.

States Dollars were translated into United States Dollars generally
at applicable par values established by contibutors with the
International Monetary Fund adjusted. from 8 May 1972, to
reflect the change in the par value.

the territories of a number of members at central rates or floating
rates for their respective currencies. effective 30 June 1972 the
Board of Diractors approved the use of appropriate certral rates
and floating rates for pusposes of translation of currencies and,
in respect of capital set aside pursuant to the provisions of Article

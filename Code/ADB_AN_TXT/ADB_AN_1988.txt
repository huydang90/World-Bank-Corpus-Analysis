The Asian Development Bank, an international partnership of
47 member countries”, is engaged in promoting the economic and
social progress of its developing member countries in the Asia-Pacific
region.

The Bank started functioning in December 1966 with its Headquarters in Manila, Philippines. It is owned by.the governments of
32 countries from the Asia-Pacific region and 15 countries from Europe
and North America.

In 22 years of operations, the Bank has become a major catalyst
in promoting the development of the most populous and fastest growing region in the world today. The Bank’s principal functions are: (i) to
make loans and equity investments for the economic and social
advancement of developing member countries; (ii) to provide technical
assistance for the preparation and execution of development projects
and programs and advisory services; (iii) to promote investment of
public and private capital for development purposes; and fiv) to respond to requests for assistance in coordinating development policies
and plans of member countries. In its operations, the Bank is also
required to give special attention to the needs of the smaller or less
developed countries and give priority to regional, subregional and
national projects and programs which will contribute to the harmonious
economic growth of the region as a whole.

The financial resources of the Bank consist of ordinary capital
resources, comprising subscribed capital, reserves and funds raised
through borrowings; and Special Funds, comprising contributions
made by member countries, accumulated net income and amounts
previously set aside from the paid-in capital. Loans from ordinary
capital resources, which account for 67 per cent of Bank lending,
are generally made to member countries which have attained a
somewhat higher level of economic development. Loans from the
Asian Development Fund are made on highly concessional terms and
almost exclusively to the poorest borrowing countries,

The Bank has borrowed funds for its ordinary operations from
the capital markets of Europe, Japan, the Middle East and the United
States. The Bank's callable capital, which at the end of 1988 accounted
for nearly 88 per cent of its subscribed capital, backs its borrowings
in the capital markets.

The Bank's operations cover the entire spectrum of economic
development, with particular emphasis on agriculture, rural developnent, energy and social infrastructure, Most Bank financing is designed
to support specific projects. In certain cases, the Bank also provides
‘program, sector and multiproject loans.

The Bank actively pursues co-financing activities with official as

~ well.as commercial and export credit sources. The Bank has also
entered into equity investment operations.

The Bank's ‘highest policy-making body is its Board of Governors which meets annually, The direction of the Bank’s general operations is the responsibility of the Board-of Directors — composed of
42 Directors (each with an Alternate) — eight representing regional
countries and four representing non-regional countries. The Board
“of Governors conducts an élection for the Board of Directors every

— dealing with various operational, financial, administrative and
general support fuictions.

Section 13 of its By-Laws, I submit to the Board of
Govemors the enclosed. Annual Report of the Bank
for 1988, including a separate report on the activities

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

THE Board.of Governors is vested with all the powers of the
Bank. With the exception of certain powers specifically reserved to them under the Charter of the Bank, the Board of
Governors has delegated its powers to the Board of Directors which is responsible for the direction of the general operations of the Bank. The Board of Diréctors performs its duties
on a full-time basis at the Bank’s Headquarters and meets in
formal session under the chairmanship of the President of the
Bank. ; oe

A few changes occurred in-the membership of the Board
in the course of the year. Two new Directors (one of whom
took the place of Director S. M. Kelkar who suddenly passed
away) were elected while three new Alternate Directors were
appoinied. A list of the 12 Directors and their Alternates
follows this chapter, while Appendix 4 provides more details
on Board membership and voting groups.

General

The Bank’s lending and investment operations in 1988
totalled $3,162.3 million, composed of $3,087.6 million for
57 government and government-guaranteed loans for 52 projects, $58 million for four loans without government guarantee
for private sector entities and $16.7 million for eight equity
investments. In addition, the Board approved two equity
underwriting commitments for $20 million, and 187 grantfinanced technical assistance projects amounting to $58.8
million, of which $16.5 million is being financed by the Japan
Special Fund and $12.3 million is being provided from other
external sources.

During the year, the Board conducted a number of
reviews on financial and operational issues. At the beginning
of the year, the Board endorsed a proposed indicative borrowing program of approximately $800 million. A mid-year
review of the Bank’s borrowing program and liquidity situation indicated that the level of liquidity at the end of the year
was likely to remain high. It was, therefore, decided to reduce
the year's borrowing program to only three “market presence”
issues, totalling $434.7 million, undertaken in, the capital
markets of Japan, Switzerland and United States. The borrowing in Japan, amounting to ¥ 30 billion, represented the
Bank’s first Daimyo public bond issue in that country.

During the year, the Bank’s variable lending rate declined
further (to 6.59 per cent for the first half and to 6.53 per cent
for the latter half) reflecting in part the low cost of borrowings
made in 1987 and in part the liability management efforts
which resulted’ in the reduction of the cost of pooled
borrowings. ©

Policy Review

The Board submitted to the Board of Governors for their
consideration at the Twenty-First Annual Meeting a report providing an updated review of the progress on the study of the
Bank's futuze resource requirements as well as a program of
work in preparation for the forthcoming Fourth General
Capital Increase discussions. One of the aspects of work
envisaged in this program was the settlement of the question
of Valuation of the Bank’s Capital and the related question
of maintenance of value obligations. The Board held several
discussions on these issues and further discussion on these
matters is expected.

The Board continued discussion on the issue of increases

“in capital subscriptions of certain members and the consequen
tial increase in the authorized capital stock of the Bank. The
Board decided to recommend to the Board of Governor
Special Capital Increases.in respect of only three countries,
viz., Japan, United States and Sweden. Accordingly, draft
resolutions were submitted to the Board of Governors for such
Special Capital Increases as well as for an increase in the
Authorized Capital Stock. They were subsequently adopted
by the Board of Governors.

In the course of its review of the current policy on ADF
lending operations, the Board examined the question of the
eligibility of People’s Republic of China and India to have
access to ADF resources. The Board decided to classify the two countries in Group A as they satisfied the current Bank
criteria for such a classification. Even though the two countries
thus became eligible for ADF lending, it was not currently
envisaged that they would have access to ADF resources. The
situation, however, would be reviewed in due course after
taking into consideration the availability of ADF resources after
meeting the requirements of traditional borrowers as well as
those of Indonesia and Philippines which have been allowed|

 

limited access to the Fund,

The Board continued its discussions towards developing a suitable policy framework for implementing a program
of guarantee operations and decided to extend the Bank’s
guarantee operations on a selective basis, limiting them to
situations wherein Bank intervention would clearly assist
developing member countries (DMCs} to obtain funds from
capital markets on more favorable terms than would otherwise be possible.

The Board reviewed policy on supplementary financing
of cost-overrun projects and decided that the existing policy,
though adequate for the purpose, should be applied with
greater flexibility, especially in circumstances when costoverruns occur due to circumstances beyond control of the
borrower.

With a view to streamlining its technical assistance operations, the Board approved increases in the ceilings for grant
finance in existing technical assistance categories and added
a grant component to technical assistance program loans.
Limits on technical assistance approvals granted by the President under delegated authority were also substantially raised.

With a view to encouraging enhanced uiilization of
technical assistance loans by DMCs, further simplification and
streamlining of procedures applying to these loans were
approved by the Board. 4

In recognition of the i increasing emphasis DMC governments were placing on’ private sector development, the Board
took further steps towards stimulating the growth of this sector.
The Board approved equity investments in two venture capital
companies and several public and private sector entities as
well as partial underwriting of two mutual funds. Following
a review of the Bank's policy on private sector operations,
improvements to the policy were agreed upon to provide
greater flexibility in the size of equity investments and loans
and lower commitment fees.

At the Twenty-First Annual Meeting, many Governors
emphasized the need for the Bank to devote greater attention towards targeting its assistance on the poorer and disadvantaged categories in its DMCs. In response to such
concern, an internal Task Force on Poverty Alleviation was
established to formulate guidelines in developing an
appropriate strategy for Bank action in this imporiant area.
The Task Force compiled a comprehensive report on the subject which was considered by the Board.

As a further development of the Bank's increasing attenion to projects with a greater poverty alleviation content, the
Board, for the first time, approved a Joan to the microenterprise sector in the Philippines as a pilot venture. The
project is intended to assist the development of microenterprises among low-income groups under the selfemployment loan assistance program of the Government,
using non-governmental organizations (NGOs), again for the
first time, as intermediaries for credit and technical assistance.

The Board approved a financial arrangement with the
Govemment of Japan under which the Bank would administer
a special fund called the Japan Special Fund (JSF) established
by the Japanese Government for accelerating the economic
growth of DMCs through financing or co-financing technical
assistance projects and equity investments. The JSF has made

a substantial contribution to the technical assistance program
of the Bank during the year.

The Board also approved a bas financial arrangement
with the Government of Japan under which the Bank would
administer a scholarship program to be funded by the
dapanese Government. The program is intended to offer
scholarships to eligible candidates from DMCs for advanced
studies in management, technology or any other
development-related fields. A total of 49 scholarships was
awarded under this program during the year.

In response to a request made by the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) for the establishment of
a general cooperation agreement for the Bank to act as an
executing agency for that organization, the Board submitted
a draft resolution to the Board of Governors for the conclusion of a Basic Executing Agency Agreement with UNDP. The
resolution was adopted by thé Board of Governors and
thereupon an agreement was concluded between the two
organizations.

The Panel for the study of the role of the Bank in the
1990s met five times during the year, in Manila as well as outside the Philippines. The Panel also met twice with the
members of the Board.

The Board approved the establishment of two Resident
Offices in Nepal and Pakistan, respectively. Upon establishment of these two offices, the number of Resident and/or
Regional Offices will increase to five.

Administration

On the recommendation of the President, the Board appointed Mr. In Yong Chung, a former Deputy Prime Minister
of the Republic of Korea,as a Vice-President of the Bank for
a term of five years from 1 August 1988. Mr. Chung fills the
vacancy created by the resignation of former Vice- President
M. Narasimham.

The Board approved a 5.2 per cent salary increase for
professional staff. A limited self-insurance scheme to indemnify the Bank’s expatriate professional staff for loss or damage
to their personal property in force majeure situations was also
approved.

As regards the supporting staff, a 12 per cent salary increase, a one-time salary adjustment of 1,52 per cent, to be
paid as a himp sum, and several other benefits were approved.

The Board approved a capital expenditure program for
the expansion of office accommodation for the Bangladesh
Resident Office.

Directors’ Visits

Short visits were made to the following DMCs by groups
of Directors to obtain first-hand information on the Bank’s
operations in these countries and also to hold discussions on
relevant policy issues:

1 The Panel presented its report in January 1989.(i) Sri Lanke and Republic of Korea —
20 February to 6 March; and

(i) Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea
and Tonga — 8 to 30 October.

Committees

The Audit Committee examined the Bank’s Financial
Statements as well as the scope of outside audit and found
them satisfactory. It also noted with satisfaction the opinions
of outside auditors on these financial statements. The Committee reviewed the activities of the Internal Audit Office,
including a review of two Audit Recommendations Implementation Reports for 1988. It also reviewed the activities of the
Post-Evaluation Office, which included an examination of 10
Project Performance Audit Reports and three Special Studies
done by the latter office. The Committee also considered the
Report of the President to the Board of Directors on PostEvaluation Activities during 1987 and the Tenth Review of
Post-Evaluation Reports. The Committee emphasized, inter

alia, the importance of conducting more preliminary work,
such as detailed engineering design and preparation of bid
documents, for achieving greater success in project implementation. The Committee also advised the Board on the appointment of outside auditors for 1989 and the recommendation
was accepted by the Board.

Membership of the Audit Committee is shown in Appendix 5 of this Annual Report.

The Budget Review Committee examined in detail the
proposals of the 1989 Administrative Budget which involved
a proposed expenditure commitment of $109.4 million. This
represented a nominal increase of 11.9 per cent over the 1988
Revised Estimate, of which 1.8 per cent was attributable to
new and additional requirements.

This was determined to be acceptable in the context of
an anticipated increase in the Bank’s work load and the budget
was recommended to, and subsequently approved by, the
Board. .

Membership of the Budget Review Committee is also
shown in Appendix 5.

THE BANK IN 1988

DURING 1988, Bank lending and investment operations
amounted to $3,162.28 million. Lending commitments rose
29 per cent to $3,145.61 million, including a substantial increase in private sector loans, while investments amounted
to $16.67 million compared with $22.6 million in 1987. Two
underwriting commitments for a total of $20 million were also
approved.

The robust growth was mainly due to increased lending
to 15 of the Bank’s developing member countries (DMCs} —
particularly People’s Republic of China, India, Pakistan and
Philippines.

Loans from ordinary capital resources (OCR} rose-sharply
by 39 per cent to $2,062.2 million from $1,480.9 million in
1987. Loans from the Asian Development Fund (ADF)
increased by a more modest 13 per cent to $1,083.4 million
from $957.6 million in 1987.

The year saw a strong rise in program lending with six
program loans totalling $660 million, compared to two program loans for $202 million in 1987. Program lending accounted for about a fifth of total Bank lending in 1988. In
‘addition, seven sector loans amounting to $434 million were
approved in 1988, compared with five such loans totalling
$581 million in 1987.

The Bank also significantly expanded its private sector
activities. Four loans without government guaraniee totalling
$58 million were approved, nearly triple the 1987 figure of
$20.5 million. Eight equity investments amounting to $16.7
million were approved, a decline from $22.6 million in 1987.
However, underwriting operations increased from one commitment of $5 million to two commitments totalling $20
million.

Technical assistance grants (including regional activities}
approved by the Bank, and funded by the Bank and other
sources,"increased by over 40 per cent to $59 million from
$42 million in 1987.

1 On 1 danuary 1989, the rate was further reduced to 6.42 per cent per
annum, the lowest since the start of the Bank's operations,
2 The report was presented in January 1989.During the year, 61 loans were approved for 56 projects
in 18 DMCs. This compared with 52 loans for 48 projects in
17 DMCs in 1987. The average loan size rose to $52 million
from: $47 million a year earlier. The size of individual loans
ranged irom $900,000 to Kiribati for a power distribution
project to a $198 million loan to India: for a road improvement project. ,

Co-financing rose by 55 per cent io $774 million from
$498 million the previous year. Official sources of co-financing
soared 138 per cent to $680 million from $286 million in
1987, and their share of total co-financing rose to 88 per cent
from 57 per cent. Co-financing from commercial sources fell
to $94 million from $212 million in 1987, or 12 per cent of
the total compared with 43 per cent the previous year.

On a sectoral basis, lending to the industry and non-fuel
minerals sector increased by nearly a third to $825.95 million
from $645.5 million in 1987, although the sector’s share of
total lending remained at the 1987 level of 26 per cent.
Volume was boosted by three program joans to Bangladesh,
Indonesia and Pakistan totalling $465 million and lending to
the private sector without government guarantee (S34 million
compared with $20.5 million the previous year).

Loans to the agriculture and agro-industry sector rose
27.4 per cent to $674 million from $529 million in 1987. The
sector's share of total lending decreased to 21 pet cent from
22 per cent in 1987.

Lending to the transport dad communications sector fell
20.6 per cent to $630.4 million from $793.9 million a year
earlier. The share of this sector dropped to 20 per cent from

33 per cent in the same period. This was attributable to a,

smaller 'number of loans, particularly for ports.

The energy sector saw lending rise to $567 million from
$332 million a year earlier, mainly due to three large projects
approved for India, Pakistan and Philippines totalling $380
million. The sector’s share of total lending rose to 18 per cent

in its first year of operation.

By the end of 1988, the Bank had provided project
preparatory technical assistance amounting to $260 million,
resulting in 374 Bank loan projects totalling $11 billion and
involving an estimated total investment cost of about $28
billion.

Also by the end of the year, the Bank had approved $1.5
billion for advisory and project implementation technical
assistance and $54.5 million for regional activities in grants.

Loan disbursements rose by 34.1 per cent to a record
$1.65 billion from $1.23 billion in 1987. The strong disbursement performance could be attributed to the expansion of
quick-disbursing program loans, close monitoring of project
administration, an improvement in loan disbursement procedures, effective operations of the Resident Offices, greater
use of imprest accounts and the statement of expenditure
mechanism and effective country projects review and disbursement missions, as well as measures taken by several borrowers

. to improve and streamline their own procedures.

Disbursements under ADF rose for the seventh year in
a row to $692 million from $539 million in 1987. OCR
disbursements rose 38 per cent to $957 million from $693

payments of interest and other charges plus equity investments)! rose to $574.3 million from $129.9 million the
previous year. This was mainly due to the significant increase
in disbursements. 
The implementation of Bank-financed projects improved
markedly in 1988. These improvements were due to intensified project administration efforts and to a number of
innovative measures taken by the Bank during the year to
streamline and simplify project administration procedures.

These measures included increased delegation of authority within the Bank and to executing agencies, more advance
action for procurement and recruiting consultants and
expanded use of sample bidding documents, imprest accounts
and statement of expenditure procedures. Other steps were
taken to improve project administration, including changes
in the procedures for technical assistance consultant recruitment designed to increase the transparency of the process,
measures to heighten the impact of project administration missions and the introduction of revised procedures for the procurement of internationally-traded commodities based on
normal commercial practices. During the year, work began
on developing a computerized project administration system
that will build on the planning and monitoring capabilities of
the Loan Financial Information System. Efforts continued to
strengthen the project implementation capabilities of the

During 1988, the Bank made three borrowings equivalent
in total to $435 million. The borrowings, consisting of public
offerings in Japan, Switzerland and United States, included

the Bank's first Daimyo public bond issue in Japan, amounting to ¥ 30 billion. Daimyo bonds combine the characteristics
of Euroyen and Samurai bonds. The average original life of
the year’s borrowings, weighted by amount, was 9.65 years,
and at the end of 1988 the remaining average life of the Bank’s
outstanding borrowings, weighted by the amount of each borrowing, was 7.74 years. The net effect of the Bank’s borrowing and liability management programs in 1988 was to reduce
liquidity by $175 million.

amounted to $3,574 million (at the exchange rates specified
in the Resolution). In depositing its ADF V Instrument of Contribution in December 1988, ihe United States made available

oOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

IN 1988, the performance of the world economy was more
buoyant than was expected in the wake of the sharp October
1987 stock market decline. Output in the industrialized countries registered a solid increase and world trade expanded
rapidly. The economic performance of the developing world,
however, improved only slightly and the average growth rate
of the Latin American, African and the Middle Eastern countries was low. The Bank’s developing member, countries
(DMCs}, on the other hand, registered robust’ economic
growth. The average growth of gross domestic product (GDP}
of DMCs was close to nine per cent, almost double the growth
rate of the 1970s and the highest so far in the 1980s. Further,
the overall inflation rate of the DMCs — although rising —
was under control, the combined current account registered
a healthy surplus, and the aggregate external debt-service ratio
was relatively low.

Much credit for this strong economic performance should
go to the implementation of appropriate and effective policies
in the DMCs. Most DMCs used monetary, fiscal and exchange
rate policies for purposes of economic stabilization and attaining external and internal balance. In addition, adjustment
measures, including financial and trade liberalization and
industrial deregulation, continued to be implemented by most
DMCs to enhance economic efficiency. Most DMCs welcomed
foreign investors and expanded the role of private initiative.

The International Setting

In 1988, world output rose 4.1 per cent from 3.2 per
cent in 1987 and growth in the volume of world trade
increased for the third year running, by 9.2 per cent compared to 6.1 per cent in the previous year. Import growth was
Particularly buoyant in Japan which experienced strong
domestic demand-led expansion, while the United States and
the newly industrialized economies (NIEs) of Asia led the
expansion in exports.

The coordination of economic policy among industrialized
countries, which began with the Plaza Accord of 1985, played
a major role in improving the performance of the world
economy. The spirit of the Plaza Accord continued in 1988,
and the Group of Seven agreed to intensify economic policy

coordination and to reject protectionist measures as a means
of dealing with external imbalances. This position was reaffirmed by the heads of State or Government of the seven
major industrialized countries at the dune Summit in Toronto.
Despite significant progress in recent years, external debt
remains a problem for many developing nations. The
cooperative international approach to the external debt problem continued to evolve in 1988. The approach has been
based on four principles: the importance of stronger growth
in debtor nations; debtor economic reforms to achieve that
growth: externa! financial support; and a case-by-case
approach to individual problems. This approach has allowed

countries to choose from a number of options for financial
support, including new financial flows and voluntary, marketbased techniques for reducing debt or debt-service burdens.
The Summit leaders agreed to a debt relief plan for the poorest
debtor nations.

A number of additional proposals for addressing debt
problems of middle-income countries were made during the
year, including those proposed by Japan and France.
However, the growth-oriented, market-based approach for
addressing developing countries’ debt problems was reaffirmed

at the annual meetings of the World Bank and the Interna- °

tional Monetary Fund. The international community also encouraged further development of market-based techniques
that increase financing or reduce the stock of debt without
transferring risk from private creditors to the public sector.

Policy coordination and,large shifts in exchange rates had
a lagged impact on trade performance among the three largest
industrial countries and narrowed trade imbalances significantly
in real terms. The current account deficit of the United States
declined to 2.5 per cent of gross national product (GNP) in
1988, after reaching a high of 3.4 per cent in 1987, while
dapan’s current account surplus declined to 2.8 per cent of
GNP from 3.6 per cent a year earlier. The Federal Republic
of Germany’s current account surplus, however, remained
around four per cent of GNP.

Global trade imbalances, while improving, are still large,
and there is a danger that this could generate pressures for
increasing protectionism. Some signs of this tendency are
already visible in the increasing number of export restraint

arrangements, including the Omnibus Trade and Cornpetitiveness Act of 1988 in the United States and tighter antidumping laws in the European Community. Also,there is sorne
apprehension among the developing countries that the Free
Trade Agreement between Canada and the United States,
and the move to full economic integration of the European
Community by 1992 may reduce their access to these
markets. In this context, the Uruguay Round of the multilateral
trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade has assumed great importance and the success of
the negotiations may depend upon progress made in reducing
the trade imbalances among the three largest industrialized
countries — United States, Japan and Federal Republic of
Germany — and to a lesser extent the Asian NIEs. At the
mid-term review, some progress was made in establishing the
framework for liberalizing trade in services, tropical products
and other items. These accords were, however, put on hold
until April 1989 because of the disagreement on farm policies
between the United States and the European Community.

Most developing countries significantly strengthened
adjustment efforts, notably in fiscal policy, in 1988. Although
the current account deficit of the oil-exporting countries as
a group widened, many were able to reduce budget deficits
through belt-tightening measures. The primary producing and
exporting countries in sub-Saharan Africa adopted comprehensive structural adjustment programs which combined
measures of fiscal restraint and firm monetary controls with
reforms in the areas of price, interest and exchange rates. As
a result they were able to reduce both the current accountand budgetary deficits. A number of couniries with a history
of high inflation were, however, unable to adjust satisfactorily
and this brought increased pressure on their external and
internal accounts.

In 1988, developing countries also succeeded ir
establishing the Giobal System of Trade Preferences (GSTP)
which seeks to promote and expand trade among developing countries through the mutual exchange of trade concessions. The GSTP agreement came into force in April when
48 countries became origina! signatories and exchanged concessions. Although the beginning was modesi, it is hoped that
through successive stages of negotiations the GSTP will be
strengthened to encornpass a wider membership and larger
range of goods and thus fulfill its aims of greater economic
cooperation among deveioping countries.

Economic Situation in Industrialized Countries

The current expansion in the industrialized countries is
in iis sixth year, making it the longest period of continuous
growth this century. Their aggregate GNP growth rate rose
to 4.1 per cent from 3.3 per cent in 1987. An important factor
behind this was the strong growth of domestic demand in
Japan and Federai Republic of Gerrnany which resulted in
higher GNP growth and imports. This, in turn,/helped to
stimulate growth in the United States where real net exports
increased by as much as one per cent of GNP, and real GNP
grew by four per cent, the strongest rate since 1984.

A cenira! feature of the recent growth performance in
most industrialized countries has been the strength of business
investment, which in 1988 increased by 10.6 per cent in the
seven major industrial counties. The unemployment raie also
declined to 7.1 per cent from 7.6 per cent in 1987, with the
rate in the United States falling to 5.4 per cent, the iowest
since the oil crisis'‘in 1973. However, in most of continentai
Europe there was no decline in the high rates of unemployment, which have averaged over 10 per cent for the last five
years. The average inflation rate increased marginally to 3.2
per cent frorn three per cent in 1987, but still remains Jow
by recent standards. International interest rates moved
downwards until the end of March as the major industrialized
countries strove to stave off a recession following the October
1987 stock market setback: With an increase in the US prime
lending rate in May, international interest rates began to rise
and the uptrend should continue as many industrialized countries are expected to maintain higher interest rates to stem
inflation.

The combined current account deficit of the industrialized countries increased slightly to $45/2 billion from $42.9
billion in 1987. The favorable effect of lower oil prices was
almost entirely offset by the effect of higher non-oil primary
goods prices.

Most forecasters expect the current expansion to con
tinue, although at a slower pace, for the next two years. Two,

problems. however, threaten the sustainability of this growth.
First, external imbalances, despite some reduction in 1988,
are still very large and there is some question whether financial markets can continue to finance these at prevailing interest
and exchange rates. Second, because of the recent strength

Six Months

of growth in the industrialized countries, capacity uiilizanon
rates in most countries have risen to their highest level since
1980. As output approaches capacity limits in some countries, the resurgence of inflationary pressure becomes a threat.
This could create greater uncertainty in the financial markets
in 1989, combined with tighter domestic monetary and fiscal
policies, higher interest rates and falling commodity prices.
To prevent a recession, greater coordination on exchange and
interest rates among the major industrialized countries will be
required and the countries with large internal and external imbalances must undertake domestic structural adjustment
measures to reduce them.

Economic Situation in Developing Countries

In the developing countries, there was some improvement in economic performance in 1988, with the growth rate
of output increasing to 4.4 per cent from 3.4 per cent in 1987.
This was the result of a spillover effect on developing countries from the buoyant growth in the industrial countries, the
strength of non-oil commodity prices and the rapid expansion in world trade, but these factors did not operate uniformly
and different country groups experienced varying degrees of
growth.

1.1 per cent from 0.6 per cent in 1987 due to adjustment
measures undertaken in earlier years. The decline in oil prices
resulted in an increase in their combined current account deficit
to $18.6 billion from $5.4 billion in 1987.

For the non-oil developing countries, the average GDP
growth rate of around five per cent was somewhat higher than
in 1987, and their current account surplus declined to $0.9
billion from $5.7 billion in 1987. The growth experience of
individual countries, however, depended to a large extent
upon their export performance. For example, despite the
general strength of commodity prices, the prices of a number
of products, particularly tropical beverages, tended to remain
weak so that some exporters of primary commodities experienced a deterioration in their terms of trade. The growth
tate of primary product exporters as a group dropped to 2.8
per cent from 3.2 per cent in 1987, while the growth rate of
countries dependent on services and remittances at 3.4 per
cent was the same as in 1987. The growth rate of manufactured goods exporters, however, increased to six per cent from
5.6 per cent in 1987.

The total outstanding external debt of the developing
world increased slightly to $1,244 billion in 1988. To service
this debt, developing countries had to make payments of $165
billion, which were substantially larger than the gross
disbursements of foreign capital, resulting in a net capital
outflow from the developing countries of well over $30 billion.
However, because of strong growth in export earnings,
developing countries’ aggregate debt to export ratio fell for

the second year in a row to 146 per cent from 159 per cent
in 1987. The debt-service ratio was also slightly lower at 19.3
per cent, compared to 19.5 per cent in 1987.

Overview of Developing Member Countries

Contrary to earlier expectations, 1988 turned out to be
an extremely good year for DMCs and many registered higher
rates of growth. The aggregate GDP increased by an impressive 8.8 per cent, much higher than the 6.7 per cent
growth of the 1980s.

Several factors contributed to this performance. Exports
continued to grow rapidly in most DMCs, in many for the third
consecutive year, due primarily to the favorable effect of
exchange rate realignmenis and external demand, including
the import boom in Japan. Although the export performance
of the NIEs slackened due to weakening competitiveness in
labor-intensive goods, their export growth in dollars ranged
from 37 per cent {in Singapore) to 13 per cent (in
Taipei, China). Thailand registered an export growth of 38 per
cent, while India registered 20 per cent. In many DMCs,
growth was also supported by an increase in domestic demand
due to increased export earnings and deregulatory policies
of the governments.

Another factor behind the strong growth performance has
been the sharp tise in private foreign investment activities in
the Asia-Pacific region. Although a rise in investment flowsnas been observed since 1987, the most rapid increase occurred in 1988 when Japan and the NIEs expanded their investment outflows enormously. While Southeast Asian countries benefited the most from this, foreign investment fiows
to the People’s Republic of China and South Asian countries
also increased.

At the sectorai level, the recovery in agriculture in several
countries strongiy boosted the growth performance of DMCs.
In India, agricultural output increased by about 18 per cent
from a decline of around two per cent in 1987. In Indonesia,
Philippines, Thailand and many South Pacific countries, the
agriculture sector performed better than in 1987. The recovery
in agriculture in most DMCs also helped to complement sustained growth performance in the industrial secior.

In contrast to 1987, a strong convergence of growth rates
occurred among the various country groups. While the NIEs
experienced a slight slowdown, Southeast Asian countries
consolidated their recovery further due to the continuing
strength of-manufactured exports and non-oil commodity
prices along with increasing domestic demand. Many South
Asian countries and South Pacific countries recovered from
the naturat disasters and poor weather conditions of 1987 and
registered higher growth rates in 1988. The growth rate of
the People’s Republic of China increased primarily due to the
yapid growth of the industrial sector and exporis.

In 1988, inflation increased in most DMCs“due to currency realignments, strong domestic demand, and ‘the failure
of agriculture in several DMCs in'’1987. Inflationary pressures,
however, remained under control and did not pose a major
threat to growth prospects, except in the People’s Republic
of China. Among the various country groups, the NIEs
registered the lowest inflation rate (five per cent) and the
People’s Republic of China the highest (19 per cent).

The aggregate GDP growth of DMCs was double the rate
for the entire developing world and reflected their continued
pragmatic policy-making and resilience. In 1988, DMCs continued to deregulate their economies and thereby achieved
higher rates of resource mobilization, capital accumulation,
and productivity increases through successful technology
transfer in both the agricultural and industrial sectors. Although
the overall inflation rate in DMCs increased to 9.8 per cent
in 1988, it continues to be much lower than the average for
the developing world.

While the current account deficit of the developing world
deteriorated significantly to a huge deficit from a near balance
in 1987, DMCs registered a sizeable, although a declining,
current account surplus. The declining surplus of DMCs is
attributable to a slowdown in exports as well as a rapid increase in imports. The external debt situation in DMCs continued to remain relatively comfortable compared with the
situation of other developing regions. The ratio of extemal
debt outstanding to exports of goods and services of DMCs
was about 78 per cent in 1988, considerably lower than 146
Per cent for the entire developing world. Similarly, the debtservice ratio of DMCs was 11 per cent, compared with 19
per cent for the developing world.

The following paragraphs discuss economic
developments by five country groups: newly industrialized
economies, Southeast Asian countries, South Asian countries,
the People’s Republic of China and South Pacific DMCs.

 

Newly Industrialized Economies

Continuation of Rapid Growth

In 1988, the newly industrialized economies (NIEs)
registered, on average. a slightly slower economic growth than
in 1987 but continued to perform better than other country
groups in the world. Hong Kong and Taipei, China registered
slower growth at 7.4 per cent and 6.8 per cent, respectively.
With emerging signs of overheating, including resurgence of
inflation and tight labor markeis, the slowdown relative to performance in 1987 was a welcome adjustment and brought
growth to a more sustainable level. The Republic of Korea,

with growth of 11 per cent, became the only NIE to maintain
a double-digit growth rate for three consecutive years, based
on favorable external and increasing domestic demand.
Singapore’s GDP growth increased to 11 per cent based on
the strength of its high-technology exports, including electronic
goods, and boorning foreign investment and an efficient
service sector. During the year, economic growth in all the
NIEs tended to be more broad-based with the export-led
growth of past years being supplemented by domestic
demand, including investment and consumption spending
spurred by increased export earnings. Such broad-based
growth reduced the vulnerability of the NIEs to external
economic developments.

The per capita income of the NIEs increased sharply. The
most rapid increases were registered by the Republic of Korea,
where it rose to about $3,700 from $2,690 in 1987, and
Taipei, China, where it increased 10 $6,000 from $5,080, due
primarily to rapid GDP growth and the appreciation of their
currencies. Per capita income in both Hong Kong and
Singapore increased to more than $9,000 in 1988.

The average inflation rate of the NIEs rose to 4.7 per cent
from 2.5 per cent in 1987 due to strong growth in domestic
demand and rising wages. It was, however, relatively low compared with that of other country groups. Among the NIEs,
Hong Kong had the highest. inflation rate"(7.5 per cent),
followed by the Republic4t Korea {6.9 per cent). Singapore
and Taipei, China registered inflation rates of less than two
per cent. :

Double-Digit Export Growth

Merchandise exports in dollar terms of the NIEs continued
to register double-digit growth in 1988 for the third year in
arow, due primarily to favorable external demand. Singapore
registered the highest export growth (37 per cent), followed
by Hong Kong (30 per cent), Republic of Korea (28 per cent),
and Taipei,China (13 per cent). Also reflecting the rapid
growth of domestic demand in Japan which has generated
an import boom in the region, the NIEs’ exports to Japan
increased by 51 per cent in 1987. Asa result, Japan's share
of the NiEs' exports increased to 12 per cent in 1987 from
10 per cent in 1986. .

The growth of exports in dollar terms from Hong Kong,
Republic of Korea and Taipei,China, however, slowed from
1987 as the competitive edge of these countries weakened
due to the appreciation of their currencies combined with rising
wages and inflation. Loss of competitiveness provided an
impetus for labor-intensive industries to relocate abroad, but
high-technology exports such as computers and electronic
goods continued to register rapid growth. Exports from
Singapore increased more rapidly than in 1987 on the strength
of machinery and telecommunication equipment, which com
- prised nearly one-half of its merchandise exports, and re
exports from neighboring countries.

Aggregate merchandise imports of the NIEs increased by
31 per cent in 1988, as compared to 35 per cent in 1987,
because of strong domestic demand, tariff cuts and currency
appreciation. With continued surpluses in the current account,

a eeenet foreign capital inflows into the NIEs were negative, parily
due to increased outflow of foreign investment and the eariy
repayment of debts in the Republic of Korea. Increases in current account surpiuses of Hong Kong, Republic of Korea and
Singapore contributed to an improvement in their international
reserves. There was @ substantial decline in the current account surplus of Taipei,China and its international reserves
also declined somewhat. However, the position of
‘Taipei, China improved from the third to the second largest
holder of internationa! reserves in the world. In 1988,
Taipei,China also overtook Japan as the world’s largest
importer of gold.

Domestic Policies

The major objective of monetary and fiscal management

in- Republic of Korea and Taipei, China was to reduce the impact of the huge current account surplus and to minimize its

disruptive effect on the domestic economy. The focus of policy

was, therefore, on incurring budgetary surpluses, tightening

domestic credit and encouraging an outflow of foreign invest
ment. In addition, the Republic of Korea prepaid extemal debt.

‘Despite these measures, liquidity in the financial sector tended
to be excessive and Taipei,China attempted to mop this up

by open market sale of securities. The Republic of Korea relied

‘instead on’ selling monetary stabilization and foreign exchange
- equalization bonds to financial ifistitutions. During the year,
however, the Korean Government announced that it would

increasingly use the traditional indirect tools of monetary con
trol-such as open market operation and manipulation of

reserves and discount rates. The Hong Kong Government,

‘in aslight reversal of its free market policy, moved a step closer

towards controlling interest rates by requiring the note-issuing °

bank to pay interest on its balance with the Exchange Fund.
In'1988. the budgetary surplus in Hong Kong was larger than
expected because of the economic boom and the Governmegnt:reduced personal and corporate income taxes slightly
to‘benefit primarily the middle-income group.
‘New governments came to power in Republic of Korea
_and Taipei,China in 1988, Both governments attached high
priorities to economic restructuring and deregulation through
. liberalization of the financial sector, the indusirial sector and
international trade. For this purpose. the Republic of Korea
appointed a Presidential Commission on Economic Structuring..In addition to dereguiatory issues, spending on social

-welfare.to improve equity and distribution is also expected
to figure prominently in the recommendations of the Commission,

In an effort to deveiop products with higher value-added,
Singapore announced a new tax scheme in which investment
allowances are to be given to firms that upgrade, automate
and modernize. Such allowances are to be higher for firms
which adopt new technology and minimize the use of labor.
In 1988, rising wages and currency appreciation continued
to drive many of the NIEs’ low-technology industries to the
People’s Republic of China, Southeast Asian and, to some
extent, South Asian countries. To help firms benefit from this
ongoing process of shiiting comparative advantages,
‘Singapore and Republic of Korea introduced tax initiatives to

encourage the outward flow of direct invesiment.

Reform of the financial sector continued to dominate
economic policy-making in the NIEs as governments set out
to tackle the central problem of how to funnel -massive export earnings to productive investment. The Republic of Korea
partially deregulated interest rates on bank loans and
cettificates of deposit, and abolished credit and loan ceilings
on banks. Taipei, China issued licenses to new security firrns,
reiterated plans to privatize three government-owned commercial banks, and to permit private banks. The Government
also announced a capital gains tax on stock market earnings
in order to stem financial disintermediation. The proposal was
subsequently modified to avert a major stock market crash
Hong Kong revamped the management committee of its stock
exchange and gave international and institutional investors
a greater say in running the exchange.

In an effort to better manage bilateral trade relationships
with the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) trading partners, the NIEs adopted several
policy measures including exchange rate adjustments and
import liberalization, Also, an informal seminar attended by
OECD countries and the NIEs on “Sustaining the Development of the Global Economy” was planned for January
1989.1 This was expected to be the first step towards greater
economic coordination between the two which could ultimately
lead to some form of membership for the NIEs in OECD.

In 1988, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taipei, China
allowed their currencies to appreciate with respect to the US
dollar; the Korean won by about 10 per cent, the new Taiwan
dollar by about 11 per cent and the Singapore dollar by four
per cent. The Hong Kong dollar remained pegged to the US
currency. .

In its trade liberalization efforts. the Republic of Korea
reduced tariffs on over 100 items, thereby decreasing the
average tariff rate to approximately 18 per cent. This process
is to continue and by 1993 the average tariff rate is projected
to decline to about eight per cent which is similar to the levels
in the OECD countries. The Republic of Korea also lifted its
ban on direct trade with North Korea and is seeking to diversify and establish trade with the People’s Republic of China
and Eastem Bloc countries. Taipei,China cut tariffs on a large
number of products and reduced the average tariff rate to 5.3
per cent from 7.5 per-cent in order to decrease its current
account surplus.

Resirictions on capita! outflows were partially reduced in
Republic of Korea and Taipei,China. In 1988, the Republic
of Korea graduated from borrowing country status and
obtained Article 8 status at the IMF. The latter will eventually
require the country to liberalize totally capital flows and permit full convertibility of the won. The Republic of Korea also
announced that its stock market will be opened to foreigners
by 1992 and allowed local securities firms and insurance companies to invest limited amounts abroad. Taipei,China allowed
local investors to invest in foreign stocks and foreigners to invest limited amounts in iocal security firms. The stock
exchanges in Republic of Korea and Taipei.China, where the
increase in stock prices in 1988 was greater than in any other
major market, remained highly attractive to foreign investors.

Southeast Asian Countries

Strengthening of Economic Recovery

The recovery which Southeast Asia experienced in 1987
strengthened further in 1988. Thailand exhibited the best performance with an 11 per cent GDP growth, due to surging
foreign direct, and, more recently, portfolio investment which
has fuelled strong growth of manufactured exports, booming
tourism and strong agricultural performance. But the rapid
recovery has put extensive pressure on several components
of the physical infrastructure, particularly around Bangkok,
including transportation, power and communications. The
Philippines’ growth rate rose to 6.6 per cent from 4.7 per cent
in 1987 due primarily to consumption spending and, to a
lesser extent, to investment and export growth

Oil-exporting countries, Indonesia and Malaysia, also

consolidated their recovery. GDP growth in Indonesia
increased to 4.1 per cent from 3.6 per cent in 1987, while
that in Malaysia increased to 7.8 per cent from 5.2 per cent.
Economic recovery in these two countries was due to
increased demand for manufactured exports, rising non-oil
commodity prices, and strong domestic consumption and
investment spending. Prices of oil fell slightly in 1988.
Agricultural production recovered strongly in three
Southeast Asian countries, mainly due to increased foodgrain
production. This performance contributed to the sustained
growth of the manufacturing sector which has been responding both to export and domestic demand. In Malaysia,
agricultural production declined, despite strong demand,
primarily due to lower production of sawlogs and rubber.
The inflation rate increased in all Southeast Asian countries due to increased demand caused by the ongoing
recovery, depreciation of currencies and wage increases. In
Thailand, inflation increased to 3.7 per cent from 2.6 per cent
in 1987. Malaysia, which traditionally experienced an inflation rate of less than one per cent, registered a 2.7 per centinflation rate in 1988, while the rates for Philippines and
Indonesia were 9.4 per cent and 7.4 per cent, respectively.

Continuation of Export Diversification

Combined exports of Southeast Asian countries increased
by 11 per cent. The most rapid increase was registered by
Thailand with a growth of 38 per cent. This growth rate compared favorably with the export growth registered by the NIEs

- and was largely due to the upswing in commodity prices, in.creased demand and competitiveness of manufactured exports, and the export-oriented nature of foreign direct investment inflows. Exports from the Philippines increased by 13
-per cent, while Malaysia’s exports registered a much slower
seven per cent growth. Because of a fall in oil prices, Indonesia’s exports in 1988 declined by three per cent compared to a 20 per cent increase in 1987. Indonesia has,
however, achieved considerable success in promoting nonoil exports, and in June the total value of such exports
exceeded $1 billion for the first time.

Imports into Southeast Asian countries increased by 23
per cent in 1988. Thailand registered the most rapid increase
at 49 per cent, followed by Malaysia and Philippines at 19
and 10 per cent, respectively. However, imports rose by only six per cent in Indonesia. Rapid import growth in’ Southeast
Asian countries was due to af increase in imports of raw
materials and intermediate products in the manufacturing sector and increased demand for consumer goods generated by
the ongoing recovery. In addition, increased imporis of capital
goods by foreign investors to expand export capacity was an
important factor in Malaysia and Thailand.

In almost all Southeast Asian countries, import growth
exceeded growth of exports and this contributed to an increase
in the current account deficit of Indonesia and Thailand and
to a reduction in the current account surplus of Malaysia. The
current account deficit in the Philippines was practically
unchanged from the previous year. Foreign capital inflows
were not sufficient to offset the current account deficit and
international reserves held by Indonesia decreased. Internafional reserves of Thailand, however, increased because of
the increasing capital inflows including foreign investment.
Philippines’ international reserves also increased slightly.

The aggregate external debt of Southeast Asian countries at the end of 1987 was $125 billion, compared to $110
billion in 1986.1 A large measure of this increase was due to
currency realignments, especially with regard to yendenominated loans. Indonesia was particularly affected by
these changes as its external debt outstanding reached $52.6
billion by the end of 1987 compared with $43 billion at the
end of 1986. In the Philippines, which ranked second in terms
of debt size, external debt outstanding increased to $30 billion
in 1987 from $28.9 billion in 1986. In both countries, debtservicing costs increased faster than exports of goods and services, and debt-service ratios stood at 33.3 per cent and 25.2

per cent, respectively, at the end of 1987.

In 1988, extemal debi outstanding in Indonesia increased
at a much slower rate and that in the Philippines probably
declined partly due to the limited new borrowings undertaken
by these countries and the slight appreciation of the yen. The
debt-service ratio remained more or less unchanged in the
Philippines while, in Indonesia, it increased significantly
because of a decline in exports. In 1988, the Philippines
initiated discussions for restructuring its external debt for the
third time in as many years. The Philippines also continued
to resort to debt-equity swaps in an attempt to reduce further
drawings on its reserves to meet debt-servicing costs.
However, during the year, partly because of the concem that
debt-equity swaps may add to inflationary pressures, some
modifications were made in the program. Still, by the end &
1988, the Central Bank of the Philippines had agreed to $1.3
billion in debt-equity swaps from a total application of $1.8
billion. .

The external debt position of Malaysia and Thailand was
quite comfortable. In 1987, the amount of external delt
outstanding in Malaysia was $21.7 billion, and $20.7 billion
in Thailand, with the corresponding debt-service ratios at 20
per cent and 20.6 per cent; respectively. Thailand continued
to maintain an annual ceiling of $1 billion for external bor
rowing by the public sector and prepaid some of the more
expensive loans as a means of managing the external debt
position, while Malaysia continued its policy of reduced
reliance on foreign borrowing and of prepaying and refinancing external debt. In 1988, the Malaysian Government and
public enterprises prepaid $4.9 billion of external debt and
the amount of debt outstanding declined significantly.

Domestic Policies

Southeast Asian countries adopted fight to moderately
expansionary fiscal policies in 1988. This reflected a continu
ation of the structural reforms and belt-tightening measures
initiated in Malaysia in 1983 and in Thailand a year later. In
indonesia and Philippines, fiscal policy was slightly expansionary as output and expenditures increased in 1988. During
the year, Malaysia and Thailand, marking a radical departure
from the austerity drive of the past few years, adopted
expansionary budgets and fiscal policies for 1989 with a view
to stimulating private investrnent and sustaining growth.
Thailand announced a hefty increase in infrastructural investment to reduce pressure on economic and social services.
Malaysia increased public expenditure on economic services
and reduced corporate income taxes to benefit private
investors. In both countries, increases in public expenditure
were facilitated by the improved performance of publi
revenue due to the ongoing economic recovery. The Philippines introduced value-added taxes with the objective of improving tax elasticity, rationalizing the tax structure and making it more broad-based.

Monetary policy in Malaysia and Thailand was aimed at
strengthening recovery and maintaining price stability. The
strong performance of the external sector resulted in generally
easy liquidity conditions in the financial sector. Malaysia

reduced the lending rates of commercial banks to reduce bank
margins. In Indonesia, monetary policy was generally tight
and the expansion of domestic credit was contained, while
in the Philippines it was more accornmodating.

Southeast Asian countries undertook policy reforms
which were aimed at transforming their primary and oil-based
economies into more diversified and efficient industrial structures. Policy reforms were implemented in agriculture,
industry, finance and trade. The major focus of agriculture
policy in the Philippines was the enactment of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program. The land reform program is
designed to change the pattem of land ownership in rural areas
and enhance agricultural productivity. Indonesia reduced subsidies on fertilizers and pesticides and announced that small
rural banks would be allowed to establish branches in subdistricts to mobilize rural savings and loans. To encourage
research and development and thereby enhance agricultural .
productivity, Malaysia announced that capital expenditure on
agricultural ventures would’ be tax-deductible.

On the industrial front, indonesia removed the monopoly
on plastic imports and the licensing requirements on more than
300 products inchiding. many types of steel. The Government
also deregulated the shipping industry and announced that
new shipping companies including foreign joint ventures would
be permitted and that such companies would be allowed to
lease foreign ships.

Southeast Asian countries continued policies to promote
the private sector. Malaysia reduced the corporate income tax
rate by five percentage points, and announced that 19 airports, including the international airport in Kuala Lumpur,
would be privatized and that nine projects, including the
metrolink light rail transit project, would also be privatized.
Thailand’s state railway sought to privatize several sectors of
its network and some of ifs express passenger services.
Concessions have also been given to the private sector to
operate two newly-built government-owned ports and to
construct and operate an expressway and mass transit system
in Bangkok. Recently, the Government awarded a contract
for water supply to the private sector.

Foreign direct investment has become an important
source of technology and accounted for increasing shares of
private investment finance in Southeast Asian countries in recent years. In 1988, Indonesia and Malaysia provided additional incentives to foreign investors, while Thailand restructured incentives to promote a more balanced distribution of
investment projects and to encourage projects to locate away
from Bangkok. Malaysia announced that, subject to certain
conditions, foreign investors would be permitted to wholly own
manufacturing, integrated agricultural, and tourist development enterprises and projects. Tax incentives were also to be
awarded to encourage multinational companies to establish
operational headquarters in Malaysia. Indonesia introduced
a scheme which would give foreign investors a role in the
distribution of products and revised the production-sharing
arrangement so as to provide additional incentives to foreign
oil exploration companies.

Promotion of small and medium-scale industries (SMis)
continued in Southeast Asian countries. Malaysia offered
pioneer status to SMIs and provided tax and import dutyexemptions. Malaysia also revamped the existing export
financing schemes to improve access by smal! and mediumscale exporters, and announced that concessional funding
from the ASEAN-Japan Fund would be provided to SMIs.

The financia! sector figured prominently in the policy

reforms undertaken by Indonesia and Maiaysia. With the ob-"

jective of promoting a more competitive financiai environment
and thereby assisting in promoting non-oil exports, Indonesia
yeduced the dominant position of state banks in its financial
system. It permitted the establishment of new private banks
including foreign banks under a joint-venture anangement with
jocal partners, relaxed the restrictions on new branches,
-relaxed the requirement that funds of siate-owned entexprises
be deposited in state banks and permitted ail banks to offer
savings accounts in addition to time deposit instruments. New
stock markets in the private sector, leasing companies and
‘insurance companies will also be permitted. Further, to pro_ mote the development of capital markets, Indonesia and
, Maiaysia, by imposing withholding taxes on deposits, corrected
the unequa! tax treatment between shares and bank deposits.
Malaysia also announced additional measures to encourage
unit trusts, venture capita! firms and secondary markets for
government securities.
The process of trade liberalization continued in Southeast
Asian countries. Indonesia and Malaysia reduced taziff barriers
on a number of items and Indonesia also replaced non-tariff
barriers on many items by tariffs? The Philippines continued
its import liberalization program and reduced tariffs on a
number of items. Malaysia increased expenditure on research
. and development to upgrade the quality of export products
"and followed a more aggressive export marketing and promotion strategy.
In 1988, a breakthrough in the protection of intellectual
. property rights was achieved with the signing of an agreement
:j between Indonesia and European Community (EC) countries
“providing copyright protection to EC owners of music rights.
' Asimilar agreement was subsequenily signed with the Uniied
States. It is expected that agreements in other areas, such as
protection of trademarks, will follow.
The focus of efforts to strengthen cooperation among
Southeast Asian counties centered on implementing the four
: agreements endorsed by the heads of Governments of the
~ Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ai their 1987
Manila summit. The first annual review was held in 1988 by
the ASEAN economic ministers at their Pattaya, Thailand
meeting. At the meeting, the economic ministers signed a
memorandum of understanding on the complementary autocomponents manufacturing scheme which seeks to increase
intra~-ASEAN trade and industrialization through tariff cuts on
imports of automotive parts and components of specific vehicle
models manufactured in ASEAN countries. The ministers extended the margin of preference applied to ASEAN industrial
joint ventures to 90 per cent from 75 per cent, and endorsed
an increase in the initial authorized capital of the ASEAN
Reinsurance Corporation. The ministers also agreed to coordinate ASEAN’s stand on the issues in the Uruguay Round
of multilateral trade negotiations, especially those related to
agricultural products, and to continue working actively with
the Cairns Group.

South Asian Countries

Monsoon-Aided Recovery

In 1988, growth of GDP in most South Asian countries
improved substantially, primarily due to the recovery of
agricultural production from the drought of 1987. Because
of a favorable summer monsoon, agricultural production in
India increased by 18 per cent, which boosted India’s GDP
growth rate to nine per cent from 4.4 per cent in 1987. The
GDP growth rates in Nepal at 7.1 per cent and Sri Lanka at
three per cent were aiso higher than in 1987, mainly due to
better agricultural performance. Despite an increase in the
growth rate of the agriculture sector to 4.4 per cent from 2.2
per cent in 1987, Pakistan’s GDP growth rate remained almost

unchanged from thé 1987 level of 5.4 per cent because of
a slowdown in sectors other than manufacturing. In
Bangladesh, devastating floods resulted in a decline in the
GDP growth rate to 2.6 per cent from four per cent in 1987.

The inflation rate increased in most South Asian countries. Although most South Asian countries had experienced
large budget deficits in the recent past, the immediate cause
of higher inflation in 1988 differed from country to country.
In Bangladesh, the primary factor was the devastation caused
by the floods, in Sri Lanka it was the political situation and
in Pakistan it was largely the lagged effect of the drought. Sri
Lanka's inflation rate, which increased to 13.7 per cent in 1988
from 7.7 per cent in 1987, was, after Burma, the highest in
South Asia.

External Balance Unchanged

The growth in exports of South Asian countries remained
unchanged in 1988 at 18 per cent which is substantially higher
than recent historical trends. Among South Asian countries
the most rapid increase in exports was registered by Nepal
{39 per cent), followed by Bangladesh (24 per cent) and India
(20 per cent). Pakistan registered an export growth rate of
17 per cent. The improved export performance of most South
Asian countries was primarily due to the recovery in commodity prices and their reeilistic exchange rate policies of recent
years. All South Asian countries, except Burma and Nepal,
have depreciated their currencies in real terms by over 20 per
cent since 1985.

In 1988, imports into South Asian countries increased
moderately despite the drought, higher world prices and con
_tinued import liberalization. Consequently, almost all South

Asian countries experienced an improvement of their trade
balances but the current account balances remained more or
less unchanged.

Domestic Policies

In South Asian countries, reduction of large budget
deficits remained the dominant fiscal concern. Bangladesh
introduced new revenue-raising measures including raising
customs and excise duties and sales tax; there was a substantial
increase in government revenues as a result. Burma adjusted
land tax rates to reflect land productivity and level of irrigation. In India, the major thrust of fiscal policy was on revitalizing
the drought-affected economy, promoting exports and
encouraging savings and investments. The surcharges levied
on income tax, wealth tax, and on non-essential imported
goods the year earlier to meet drought-related expenditures
were retained and the modified value-added tax was extended
to more commodities. To promote exports, tax exemptions
on profits from exports were expanded and some excise taxes
on machinery and raw materials were reduced.

In Pakistan, the government budget aimed to increase
revenues by strengthening tax administration, simplifying tax
return procedures, improving tax audits and increasing
penalties for tax evaders. With the objective of moving grad

Lee "Sri Lankaually towards @ broad-based consumption tax, the Government extended the sales tax to a large number of new items.
In Sri Lanka, the Government instituted measures to improve
control and monitoring of public expenditure, and introduced
significant reforms of the tax system, including broadening the
coverage of the business turnover tax.

In view of inflationary threats, most South Asian countries followed tight monetary policies. In India, the cash reserve
and statutory liquidity.ratios were both raised more than once
and interest rates on short-term bank deposits were increased.
In Pakistan, the growth in money supply was kept in line with
the nominal growth of output and the inflation rate was within
the targeted level. In Sri Lanka, the Central Bank increased
reserve requirements by 40 per cent to restrain growth of
money supply.

India took several new steps in its policy of industrial
deregulation. The number of industries needing licenses to
setup new- factories was greatly reduced, the thresholds for
investment and foreign exchange outlays beyond which
industrial projects would need licenses were raised substantially and other procedures were simplified. The Government
also introduced measures to promote the development of
capital markets to mobilize more resources for industrial
development. Particularly important in this regard were the
establishment of the Securities and Exchange Board of India
and the Credit Rating Information Services of India.

' In Pakistan, the Govetnmient announced further
dereguiatory measures in June. These included increasing the
threshold level of investment for projects requiring prior
approval, reducing the number of industries for which prior
‘approval is required, authorizing financial institutions to take
the final decision on the financing of projects not requiring
‘government approval, and replacing provincial government
locational approval with a published list of prohibited areas.

“To promote certain industries, a four-year tax holiday was also
granted to key industries established prior to June 1991. In
Sri Lanka, further reforms based on the recommendations of
the three committees on administrative reforms, industrial
‘policy and tariffs approved in 1987, were introduced. The
Présidential Commission on Privatization also submitted its
report with recommendations on the methods of privatization
and a short list of 25 enterprises considered suitable for
privatization in the first stage.

In Bangladesh, the immediate focus of agricultural policy
was on post-flood rehabilitation and for this purpose increasing amounts of credit and inputs were provided, sometimes
at subsidized rates. The rehabilitation of irrigation and other
agricultural infrastructure was also emphasized. In addition,
to.'forrnulate policies for the long-run development of
agriculture, an overall study of the sector was launched. India
announced a new seeds production policy to encourage the
development and production of quality seeds, Also, a new

‘initiative for conservation and improvement of productivity
in-rainfed areas was launched in India with the establishment
of .a special unit for this purpose in the Department of
Agriculture and Cooperatives. :

In Pakistan, the National Commission on Agriculture advocated a'move to an intensive, high value-added agriculture
from the present primarily cereal-based structure. The Com
mission also recommended that the private sector be allowed
a greater role in agriculture, domestic prices of agricultural
products be kept in line with international prices, and research
and extension activities be encouraged further. The Government also continued to implement its policy of removing distortions in agricultural prices by raising the support price of high
quality rice. It also abolished sugar mill zones and removed
restrictions that forced growers to supply cane to the mill of
their zone only. The rules permitting private export of rice and
cotton were further simplified and the export duty on high
quality rice was reduced. Burma and Sri Lanka significantly
increased the prices of agricultural inputs, including fertilizers.

In India, the process of financial liberalization and development of money markets continued with the introduction
of fortnightly auctions of treasury bills and the establishment
of the Discount and Finance House of India. India also entered
the money market of the United States for the first time with
the successful launching of a commercial paper by the State
Bank of India. The Pakistani Government announced that nationalized commercial banks would be partially privatized and
that these institutions would be given more autonomy in
decision-making.

South Asian countries continued to liberalize policies on
international trade. In Bangladesh, the negative and restricted
lists of imports were further reduced and tariff rates on several
imported inputs were lowered. India reduced the number of
products subject to export controls, liberalized the importation of capital goods, and reduced tariffs on textile machinery
and raw materials for the production of machinery, capital
goods and electronics. In Pakistan, the number of items on
the prohibited and restricted list was reduced further, and the
iariff structure was rationalized by reducing the maximum rate
of customs duty to 125 per cent, establishing tariff bands for
consumer goods, capital goods and raw materials and intermediate goods, and reducing the number of duty-exempt
items. To encourage exports, Nepal established a bonded
warehouse for garment exporters, liberalized licensing procedures for the importation of raw wool and other selected
items, and introduced a duty drawback scheme. Sri Lanka
reduced discrimination against the export sector by eliminating
export taxes on non-traditional agricultural and marine
exports, reducing the export duty on tea, and eliminating
export licensing requirements for other items. Burma opened
the rice export trade to the private and cooperative sectors.

The heads of State or Government of the seven countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) held their fourth annual summit in Islamabad.
Pakistan, in December. The leaders reviewed the progress
made by the organization and agreed to raise the level of
cooperation among member countries. Areas which will be
given particular attention include controlling drug abuse and
trafficking, disaster management, cooperation in trade,
manufacturing and services and the evolution of strategies for
meeting the basic needs of the people. The latter involves
developing the SAARC-2000 perspective plan which will lay
down specific targets in areas of food, clothing, shelter, education, health care, population planning and environmental proiection that have to be met by the turn of the century.

People’s Republic of China

Overheated Economic Growth

Rapid industrial growth, price reforms and a slowdown
in growth of the agriculture sector generated severe inflationary
pressures in the People’s Republic of China. The gross national product rose by 11.2 per cent in 1988, compared with
a 10.5 per cent increase in 1987. Although the agricultural
growth rate declined to 3.1 per cent from 4.7 per cent as a
result of droughts and floods during the summer, the rest of
the economy continued to grow rapidly. Industrial growth
exceeded the rapid pace of 1987 as industrial output (including
output of village industries) increased by 20 per cent compared to 16.5 per cent in 1987. Industrial growth was partly
export-led and exports increased by 20.1 per cent. Substantal grain imports, necessitated by the adverse impact of the
weather on grain output, and higher world prices boosted
imports which increased by 27.3 per cent. The trade deficit
rose to $7.7 billion from $3.8 billion in 1987. As a result, the
current account which registered a small surplus in 1987
showed a deficit in 1988, despite an improvement in the invisible balance due to higher earnings from tourism.

Price reforms, a high»degree of liquidity, a sharp increase
in domestic demand, particularly for investment and consumer
durables, and rapidly expanding exports resulted in excessive
growth and overheating of the economy. Lower grain output, shortages of raw materials and bottlenecks in the energy
and transportation sectors added to inflationary pressures.
Consequently, the country experienced its highest rate of
inflation in 40 years. The inflation rate soared to 19 per cent
from 8.8 per cent in 1987.

The total external debt had reached $30.2 billion by the
end of 1987 and continued to grow in 1988.

Domestic Policies

Encouraged by the improvement in the balance of
payments and the outstanding performance of the economy
in 1987, the Government moved to accelerate the pace of
economic reforms in 1988. In April, the National People’s
Congress approved a new state enterprise law and adopted
constitutional amendments broadening the legal basis for
private enterprise and the transfer of the use-right of land.
A major reorganization of state council ministries and commissions was also approved and the responsibility of detailed
control of individual projects was shifted from the State Planning Commission to six new specialized companies dealing
with different sectors,

In May, prices of non-staple foodstuffs were freed from
controls in several cities and provinces and over the next two
months prices of grain and edible oil were increased. However,
by this time the country was confronted with inflationary
pressure. The Government announced a two-year
moratorium on price reforms and measures aimed at bring
at

 

Per Cent."
20 
 

Per Centing inflation under contro} have been the primary focus of

government policies since then.

To check the inflationary trend, the Government has
relied on both monetary policies and direct controls. Fiscal
measures, including higher taxes, and other ways to reduce
the budget deficit are also planned. Measures taken on the
monetary policy side include firmer control of money supply
and credit, an increase in the required reserve ratio for banks,
an increase in short-term interest rates, and linking long-term
interest rates (on saving deposits of three years or more) with
the rate of inflation. Given the high degree of liquidity in the
economy, these measures will take time to have an effect and
only # they are-strictly enforced.

In addition to monetary policy, an austerity program to
curb inflation was announced in September. It included restrictions on the export of basic consumer goods in short supply,
acutback on investment spending and a suspension of major

-consiruction projects such as hotels and office buildings, curbs

on speculation, and a planned slowdown in the growth rate.
These measures had sorne success in cooling the overheated
economy by the end of the year, but their full impact will be
felt in 1989.

Progress continued to bé made in reforming the industrial
sector and, under the new state enterprise law, factory directors are given the freedom to manage their enterprises,
including the hiring and firing of workers, without interference
from local party officials. With the passage of this law, the
bankruptcy law also becomes effective and mergers and
takeovers of poorly-managed enterprises by profitable enterprises are permitted on an experimental basis. The new
contract-management system provides managers with performance incentives through a system of annual targets for enterprise profits. With these reforms, it is aimed to make state
enterprises responsive to price changes, so that price pressures
will force enterprises to increase productivity or to phase out
inefficient factories.

There was also an acceleration in the implementation of
foreign trade reforms. The decentralization of the foreign trade

. structure has resulted in a rapid increase in the number of

authorized exporters and that has given rise to some confusion among buyers and problems regarding contract enforce
-ment and quality control. However, these problems should

be resolved over time.

To promote foreign investment from Japan, an agreement was signed which provides guarantees against compulsory expropriation and for free remittance of earnings. In
addition, according to this agreement, Japanese ventures will
be accorded “national treatment” which allows such firms
access to raw materials, labor and bank loans on the same
terms as domestic firms. The Government also decided to set
up a Foreign-debt Fund to ensure repayment of the growing
foreign debts of state enterprises and other organizations.
Borrowers will contribute to the Fund and its. resources will
be used to rescue borrowers who might otherwise be forced
to default on payments.

South Pacific DMCs

Signs of Recovery

Some South Pacific DMCs (SPDMCs) showed signs of
recovery in 1988. Fiji’s GDP grew by two per cent following
a decline of 7.8 per cent in 1987 due mainly to increases in
sugar production, tourist arrivals and private investment. Ther
are indications that the economy of Solomon Islands also
recovered somewhat from the decline of the previous three
years, due to higher output and prices of fish, palm oi! and
tirnber. Papua New Guinea (PNG) registered a GDP growth
of 4.1 per cent compared to 4.8 per cent in 1987, due to
reduced investment and the poor performance of major
agricultural exports such as sawn timber, rubber, cocoa and
copra. Tonga and Western Samoa registered a GDP decline
of two per cent, mainly because of declining agricultural production, resulting from a severe drought, and lower prices for
their major export commodities. Cook Islands and Vanuatu
had not yet recovered from the considerable damage caused
by cyclones in 1987 and in 1988.

Inflationary pressures have been building up in the
SPDMCs since 1987, attributable to increased demand as a
result of the economic recovery, depreciation of currencies,
excessive credit expansion and shortages of basic food items
due to cyclones and droughts. Double-digit inflation was
recorded during 1988 in Fiji (10.5 per cent), Solomon Islands
{19.3 per cent) and Tonga (10 per cent).

The SPDMCs’ aggregate trade deficit increased because
imports grew faster than exports. Fiji's trade deficit, particularly,
rose to $150 million from $132 million in 1987 owing to the
economic recovery and associated inflation. The current
account position of the SPDMCs, however, improved owing
to higher receipts from tourism and official transfers. Consequently, debt-service ratios declined in 1988

Domestic Policies

Reflecting the varied political and economic environment,
domestic policies differed among SPDMCs. Under the new
Government, PNG continued to pursue broad-based development goals aimed at reducing unemployment (especially
among the youth) and regional income disparities, primarily
through the encouragement of private sector initiatives. Sound
implementation of public sector projects, strengthening of
manpower training and greater flexibility in exchange rate
management were emphasized. In order to alleviate the
worsening unemployment problem, which was largely responsible for the recent riots, a policy shift from the mining sector
to the labor-intensive export sector was also announced. To
promote the iabor-intensive rural manufacturing sector, PNG
reduced corporate tax rates along with real wages from the
high levels set by the Minimum Wage Board.

As the political situation stabilized in 1988,
a package of economic policies, including pump-priming public26

infrastructure projects, tax incentives for investors in the export
sector and for those engaged in agricultural diversification projects, reduction of tariffs and quantitative restrictions on consumer goods, and the establishment of tax-free zones and the
Export Institute to promote manufactured exports. The Financial Review Committee was also established to accelerate the
planned restructuring of the economy. These policies contributed to a rapid increase in exports of processed foods and
garments and in tourist industry receipts during the second
half of 1988. Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu and Westem
Samoa also adopted various tax and monetary incentives to
promote foreign investment and encourage the private sector.

Some SPDMCs, notably PNG, succeeded in reducing
their budget deficits through a combination of expenditurecutting and revenue-taising measures. PNG continued to
redirect a greater portion of the budget away from expenditures for administrative and social services to directly productive economic activities and infrastructure development.
The 1989 Budget of PNG provided further incentives to the
private sector and continued to emphasize the shift away from
direct to indirect taxation. Despite a major tax reform in 1987
and austerity measures adopted during 1988, Fiji was unsuccessful in reducing its budget deficit due to the tightened
revenue conditions combined with insufficient effort in cut
ting current expenditures. Fiscal dependency on external
sources, including borrowings and official grants to finance
the deficit, declined for PNG and Fiji. The SPDMCs increased
efforts to improve the efficiency of public enterprises and to
speed up privatization, With the objective of running public
enterprises on a sounder commercial basis, Fiji strengthened
its Public Enterprises Unit, which is under the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Planning.

The 1988 annual meeting of the South Pacific Forum
(SPF) was held in Nuku'alofa, Tonga, in September. At the
meeting, Forum members agreed to restructure the South
Pacific Bureau for Economic Cooperation, which is the
executing agency of the SPF, and to intensify regional
economic cooperation in the areas of trade, investment and
small business development. Fiji, which had not attended the
1987 meeting of the SPF owing to the country’s political
disruption, participated in the 1988 meeting. Six out of the
eight Pacific countries which are members of the Lomé Convention of the European Community, including Fiji, PNG,
Solomon I{slands, Tonga, Vanuaiu and Western Samoa,
agreed to the terms of Lomé [V which were similar to those
of Lomé III,

The long-negotiated treaty between the South Pacific
Forum Fisheries Agency and the United States concerning
licensing for fishing inside the 200-mile exclusive economic
zones of the Forum member countries, came into effect in
dune. The treaty will provide for the payment of some $60
million to be distributed among the 15 Forum countries over
a five-year period.

GUTLOOK FOR 1989

Forecasts indicate that, although the current expansion
in the industrialized countries will continue for the next twoyears, output in the indusirial countries, together with world
output and wade, will increase at a slower pace in 1989. The
externa: environment facing the developing countries is,
therefore, expected to be less favorable than in 1988, and
demand for manufactured exports and non-oil commodity
prices is expected to soften.

In 1988, the NIEs achieved a slightly iower but a more
sustainable leve! of growth based primarily on exports and,
to some extent, on domestic demand. Growth rates are expected to slow down in 1989 as Japan and the United States,
the major export markets. of the NIEs, grow more slowly.
Emerging signs of overheating such as rising inflation, tighter
credit, capacity constraints and appreciation of the currencies
in several NIEs, may cause export growth to slow down
further. Growth in domestic dernand fuelled by both consumption and investment spending is expected to be strong, but
may not be enough to pick up the slack caused by slower exports. Policy efforts are being focused on sectors with high
productivity, low labor absorptive capacity and high domestic
value-added content.

The recovery in Southeast Asia is expected to weaken
in 1989 and growth rates are likely to fall. Partly due to slower
growth in the industrialized countries, export earnings are expected to decline. This decline is expected to offset the
favorable effect on Southeast Asia’s exports due to the removal
of the NIEs from the Generalized System of Preferences of
the United States. The recent production quotas of OPEC,
like others earlier, were not expected to hold for long as both
iraq and Iran needed to increase oil production to finance postwar reforms and reconstruction. Oil prices may soften further
in 1989, lowering the prospects for Indonesia and Malaysia.
Another negative factor in Thailand is the infrastructural bottleneck which appeared due to the recent boom in foreign direct
investment and tourism. The consumption and invesimentled recovery of the Philippines is expected to lead increasingly
to further industrial activity and output growth is expected to
increase at a slightly higher rate in 1989.

South Asia is vulnerable to the vagaries of weather.
Failure of the southwest monsoon in 1987 depressed
agricultural production and growth. Agriculture recovered
sharply in most countries In 1988 despite flooding in
Bangladesh, northern India, central Pakistan and Nepal,
primarily due to increased foodgrain production. Assuming
that South Asia will have normal monsoons in 1989, the
agriculture sector is expected to resume growth of three to
four per cent annually. This will, therefore, probably lead to
a lower growth of GDP in most South Asian countries. Policy
teforms to boost efficiency of the industrial sector will be continued in South Asia and this sector will support growth and
enhance the resilience of South Asian countries. Growth of
manufactured exports are, however, likely to slow down in
1989 due primarily to adverse external factors. Poverty alleviation remains a major concern in many South Asian countries
and generation of production and employment in rural areas
will remain a key development issue.”

slower GDP growth in 1989 because of the clampdown on
capital investment and money supply expansion to stem inflation. The slight cooling of the economy will, however,
alleviate problems related to capacity constraints in the energy
and infrastructure sectors. The emphasis of economic reforms
is likeiy to be on improving the management of state enierprises. Price reforms are likely to be put on hold in 1989.

The South Pacific DMCs are expected to improve their
economic growth in 1989 as prices of their primary products
and the tourism sector recover, and their economies adjust
io the destabilizing effects of the cyclones and_ political
developments of 1987.

Growth in the world economy is expected to slow down
in 1989, DMCs are unlikely to de any different in this respect,
and 1989 should see a deceleration and a cooling of some
of the overheated economies. Economic growth in Asia,
however, wil! continue to be faster than in other regions.

Introduction

MANY of the Bank’s developing member countries (DMCs}
have achieved impressive growth and have demonstrated
remarkable flexibility in adjusting to a rapidly-changing external economic environment. These achievements have been
outlined in the preceding chapter of this Report. Many DMCs
also have made substantial progress in improving the living
conditions of large sections of their populations. But the fact
remains that most of the world’s absolute poor are in Asia.
Figures on poverty, though scarce and based on rough
estimates, show that between 550 million and 600 million people are still living in absolute poverty in the Bank’s DMCs. Until
recently, poverty was thought to be one of the unavoidable
burdens of mankind. However, governments now have the
means to eliminate absolute poverty. It is primarily ther
responsibility to eliminate it. Industrialized countries through
their donor agencies and multilateral institutions, such as the
Bank, can help overcome the problem of absolute poverty.
In response to increased attention given to this subject and
in line with the recent practice of devoting a special chapter
in the Annual Report to themes of particular relevance and
topicality, this chapter on poverty alleviation has been
included.

The Challenge

Despite the fact that poverty indicators and thresholds
vary from country to country and are difficult to compare,
the size of the problem is awesome. Poverty is most acute
in the lower-income DMCs, according to evidence provided
by DMCs, researchers and donors. It is extensive ir
Bangladesh, India and Pakistan and rising in Sri Lanka ana
Nepal despite considerable ‘external assistance. India reduced
the incidence of poverty in five years to 40 per cent in
1983-1984 from 55 per cent in 1979-1980. But the number
of poor is still enormous — 275 million in 1983-1984, compared to 311 million in 1979-1980. The People’s Republic
of China has been relatively successful in reducing poverty
but, according to a recent World Bank report,! about 130

million people remain poor. Adding to the problem, there
have been food shortages in Lao People’s Democratic
Republic and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam while war
and civil unrest have hampered efforts to improve conditions
in other lower-income DMCs.

The incidence of poverty is lower in middle-income
DMCs, bur still substantial. Indonesia, the most populous in
this group, reduced poverty but still had 60 million people,
or 35 per cent of the population, below the poverty line in
the early 1980s. In the Philippines, some 59 per. cent of the
population, or 33 million people, lived below the governmentdefined poverty line in 1985, compared with 40 per cent in
1980. In Thailand, about 23 per cent of the population, or
12 million people, was defined by the Government as poor
in 1980-1981. This figure increased to 30 per cent in
1985-1986. Despite high economic growth rates, the incidence of poverty in 1988 was about the same as in
1980-1981. :
"In higher-income DMCs such as Republic of Korea,
Malaysia and Taipei,China, which traditionally have achieved high growth rates, absolute poverty is no longer a problem.

Who are the poor? Where are they? What do they need

. and how can they be helped? These questions must be

answered before any effective program can be formulated.

In a generally accepted definition, to be poor means not
only to have a low income but also to be lacking in basic
amenities such as education, health care, shelter, safe water
and sanitation. Furthermore, a link between poverty and
environment is increasingly recognized: poverty causes environmental deterioration and environmental degradation
causes poverty.

DMC societies can be roughly divided into a formal
(public and organized private) sector, including farmers, and
an informal sector, including marginal rural groups, tribes and
nomads, and disadvantaged urban dweilers. The formal sector
has in the past been the prime recipient of development
assistance; however, the informal sector, which sometimes
includes a large part of a country’s population and almost all
of its very poor. has largely been bypassed by official development assistance.

Poverty in Asia is still primarily a rural phenomenon. The
rural poor generally comprise marginal farmers who own land

2930

but who have to supplement farm income by off-farm employment; landless agricultural leborers and non-agricultural groups
who rely on employment opportunities in the countryside, are
vulnerable to seasonal scarcities of jobs and food, have no
stocks or assets and whose creditworthiness is low or nonexistent; and artisanal fishermen who cannot generate savings
from fishing. The primary activity of these groups is survival

Urban poverty is less widespread than rural poverty. However,
it is expected to grow in the next decade because of high
population growth rates exacerbated by limited employment

opportunities and low wages in rural areas. Although the line
between the formal and informal sector is blurred, it is evident that the informal sector is a significant economic force.
In many DMCs, up to 50 per cent of the economically active
population of big cities works in the informal sector at subsistence levels. Many poor people live in squatter areas,
without access to water, power and basic sanitation facilities.
They often survive through informal occupations such as street
vending or collecting and selling garbage.

In the informal sector, women and children are generally the most disadvantaged. Evidence shows that women have
scarcely benefited from the process of development. Large
families, which are both the cause and consequence of poverty, are often the consequence of male rather than female
wishes. Children frequently suffer from malnutrition because
other family members are given priority in food distribution.
Programs aimed at helping women and children are difficult
to implement, however, because women and children are
hard to reach and are isolated from the formal process of production and exchange.

Approaches to Poverty Alleviation

Traditional attempts to reduce poverty have relied on
economic growth. High growth rates, it was argued, created
more jobs and incomes through the multiplier effect and
reduced poverty. This indirect approach proved most
successful in the newly industrialized economies (NIEs) which,
through rapid industrialization and export growth, raised living
standards and reduced absolute poverty. However, many
other DMCs have not succeeded in generating sufficiently high
growth to reduce the number of people living in poverty due
to factors such as the sheer size of the problem, an insufficient resource base, inappropriate policies and an inadequate
institutional framework. In fact, in several DMCs, a combination of low growth and inequitable distribution of the benefits
of growth has led to an increase in poverty.

Economic growth is fundamental! to development but not
enough on its own. Of equal importance is the distribution
of the benefits of growth. Growth-oriented strategies must be
supported by more direct attacks on poverty as growth alone
is insufficient to guarantee all individuals actess to employment and essential social services. In this respect, India, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka have specific plans to alleviate poverty.

Generally, higher-income countries such as the Republic
of Korea and, to a. lesser extent, Malaysia, stress a more
equitable distribution of incomes, both socially and
geographically, rather than address poverty per se. While the
strategy of higher-income DMCs has been to strive for sustained growth and to indirectly benefit the poor, several policies
involving taxation, pricing and subsidization have also been
implemented to address the needs of the poor. For example,
expanding the supply of public goods and services is one
important way of achieving a more balanced distribution.

In middle-income countries such as Indonesia, Philippines
and Thailand, growth is a priority but the creation of employment opportunities and raising incomes receive more ermphasis. There is more focus on tackling the causes of poverty, namely, underemployment, unemployment and low pro-ductivity, while general welfare is improved through the provision, often with subsidies, of basic social infrastructure. Mot
poverty alieviation programs are interlinked with rural development programs.

Among the lower-income DMCs of South Asia where
the incidence of poverty is highest, poverty alleviation features
strongly in development plans, along with growth, employment and productivity goals. Programs range from short-term

intervention to alleviate hunger and malnutrition to medium
sand long-ierrn schemes to generate employment and income.

“Bank Efforts to Reach the Poor

Traditionally, the Bank has approached poverty allevia‘tion indirectly through the financing of projects contributing
fo.economic growth and the efficient use of resources. It
assumed this approach helped create employment opportunities and higher incomes, and thus provided governments
‘with more revenue to invest in improving the welfare of the
poorest. But it is recognized that efforts to maximize economic
is growth through the most efficient use of resources must be
es" J * supplemented by other measures. Accordingly, the Bank is
‘© also. giving attention to increasing social equity and develop
ing-human resources.

On a regional level, the Bank has sought to assist the
poorer DMCs through its concessional loan facility, the Asian
‘Development Fund (ADF). Sincé it began operations in 1966,

the ‘Bank has lent $8.2 billion in 433 loans from ADF
resources. These loans have been interest-free since early
1974, carrying only a service charge of one per cent per
“>= annum. Most ADF resources have gone to Bangladesh (29.8
percent}, Pakistan (29.2 per cent), Sri Lanka (9.4 per cent),
lepal.{9 per cent) and Burma (6.4 per cent). Such an
approach leads to a more balanced regional development but
does not benefit specific poverty groups within countries.
. Aside from concessional lending, the Bank has sought
to assist projects in poverty-afflicted sectors. Since most of the
poor are in rural areas, about 30 per cent of the Bank's lending
- hasbeen committed for projects in the agriculture sector.
Moreover, such projecis are often in the less developed areas
and.are designed to maximize the use of local labor and
appropriate technologies.

Significant Bank lending has been provided for social
infrastructure projects involving water supply and sanitation,
education, urban development and housing, health and
population. Since 1968, 15 per cent of Bank lending has been

‘channelled to these sectors, most ‘of it to water supply and
sanitation and education.

The Bank has also contributed to employment creation
through credits to development finance institutions (DF ls).
DFls frequently relend Bank funds to small and medium-scale
industrial enterprises. Over 10 per cent of Bank lending has
been provided for this purpose.

 

   
 
 
  
  

 

Task Force Recommendations

At'the Bank’s Twenty-First Annual Meeting in April, the
Governors called for a sharper focus on poverty alleviation.
Accordingiy, the President established an internal Task Force

on poverty alleviation, chaired by the Vice-President for
Projects. In a report endorsed by the Board of Directors in
August, the Task Force recommended a number of ways for
the Bank to increase its activities in this field. {t recommended
that the Bank continue to rely on growth-orienteé projects
which ultimately benefit the disadvantaged. But the Task Force
also recommended that the Bank complement this approach
with projects which will benefit the poor more directiy,
Experience has shown that a direct approach can be viable
and does not need to be pursued at the expense of efficiency
or growth. .

The Task Force recommended a dua! approach to the
problem. On one hand, the Bank should pay greater attention to poverty issues in the formulation and implementation
of traditional projects. On the other hand, the Bank should
supplement this approach through projects specifically
designed io alleviate poverty. These include social infrastructure and environmental projects.as well as projects designed
to increase incomes of the poor through self-employment
{especially through mini-development finance institution
credits, including “small projects”) and wage employment
(public work programs); finally, the Bank should provide
greater support to DMC programs and policies for poverty
alleviation, including sector development/adjustment programs for such sectors as health and education.

The Task Force concluded that these new directions can
be accommodated within the Bank's present practices and procedures. These and other issues discussed in this chapter are
being actively pursued by the Bank and some projects with
an essential poverty alleviation focus have already been approved. However, the Board is yet to determine the Bank's
policy responses on some of these issues.

Operational Implications
The Bank will have to be more flexible in its operations

if it is to place greater emphasis on directly approaching
poverty alleviation. Overall, efforts need to be more focused

on specific target groups. Project benefits must reach the

landless, the small farmer or fisherman, the street vendor, the
urban squatter or disadvantaged groups of women. It is crucial
to identify the beneficiaries and to create an effective delivery
mechanism. The Bank also needs to intensify its economic
and sector work specifically related to poverty alleviation.

‘Additional resources will have to be devoted to poverty studies

in the economic and sector work program. Moreover, the
Bank will need to integrate these issues in its country programming and policy discussions with DMC governments.

Project Identification and Preparation

Although exhaustive efforts were made in the past to
ensure that Bank projects are technically viable as well as
economically and financially sound, they were sometimes
designed and implemented with little attention to the
characteristics of the beneficiaries. As a result, input packages
offered by the projects were often beyond the reach of the
poor. Project planners should be aware of the needs of target
groups and the importance of catalyzing self-help efforts.

DRESSMAKING lessons for wives of landless farmers are part of the Northwest Rural Development Project in Bangladesh. °
The project, aimed at increasing agricultural output and alleviating poverty in rural areas, was supported by a concessional Bank

loan of $45 million.

Attention must be paid to the interests, initiatives and contributions of beneficiaries and their institutions. Such an
approach requires a change in existing procedures for project
preparation and formulation which were based on feasibility
studies generally conducted by consultants with sometimes
limited exposure to local conditions. Another method of
designing more responsive projects is to encourage local
organizations and executing agencies to cooperate with Bank
staff and Bank-financed consultants at an early stage of project
preparation. Bank assistance could include conducting
baseline surveys, identifying resources and financing “preprojects”. This type of “pre-project” could be supported
through technical assistance.

Departing from the methodology employed in traditional
projects, the Bank in its poverty-oriented programs should
identify the conditions of the poor before selecting project
inputs to meet their needs, reversing the procedure in which
the project components are defined before the beneficiaries
are identified. Project identification for poverty alleviation
requires sociological and anthropological inputs as well as
economic, financial and technical analyses.

Project Implementation

A flexible “process” approach to project implernentation
is required to encourage the involvernent of beneficiaries and
to incorporate lessons learned into later stages of the project.
This approach differs from the “blueprint” approach where
implementation closely follows the schedule and terms of the
Bank’s appraisal report and where priority is given to project
inputs rather than its targets since the implementation and impact of such projects depend on the transmission of knowhow and its acceptance by the beneficiaries. This is especially
true of income-generating projects, where active involvement
of beneficiaries is required and, to a lesser extent, of social
sector and environmental investments.

There are various options for a “process” approach. One
is to break the process into distinct phases, beginning with a
pilot project lasting two years or so. Its objective would be to
undertake technical, socioeconomic and institutional analysis,
to conduct experiments with alternative technical options to
test target groups’ responsiveness and to strengthen theirorganizations. This could be followed by longer-term projects
in which activities are expanded and/or replicated. Another
- option is to cooperate more closely with an ongoing project
or experienced organization aiready working in the seiected
area. Tne experience gained from these projects/organizations would lead to the identification of a full assistance
"<pregram.
At the same time, the nature and delivery of inputs must
-be capable of being modified readily in response to the needs
ofthe target group. The modifications would involve the size
nd terms of credit, design and venue of training activities and
the use of separate delivery channels (such as having women
tension workers to reach women farmers). Such services
éannot, however, be achieved through the traditional fixed
‘package” of inputs and they require the participation of other
organizations. Consequently, poverty-oriented projects may
nvolve higher costs than traditional projects.

   
 
 
 
  
  
   
   
  
  
 
  
 
   
 
  
  
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 

‘Decentralization of Decision-Making

’ Decision-making by central government institutions bars
‘beneficiaries from taking part in project formulation, design
and implementation. Such institutions are generally more
suited for projects which involve a large-scale delivery of sezvices to a widespread population, but they do not always
“address the needs of the poor. Executing agencies should be
ble to plan and implement projects at grass roots level and,
nore often than not, local institutions have a better undertanding of target groups than the central government. They
iso:have more structural flexibility, staff skills, motivation and
‘commitment

“The use of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as
ecuting or implementing agencies presents another chanfor reaching the poor. Although their financial capacity
sually limited, many have had considerable success in helpthe poor, especially the extremely disadvantaged. Other
‘hannels of Bank assistance to the poor include credit associaions; foundations and informal bodies such as self-help
ups. Such agencies share an understanding of, and
roximity to, target groups

‘Financing Modalities

: A direct approach to poverty reduction requires more
. ; financing flexibility, especially with regard to local costs and
, tooperation and maintenance (O&M) expenditures. Poverty“directed projects typically need little foreign exchange but a
- dot-of local cost financing. This applies to income-generating
: projects as well as social infrastructure schemes. Thus the Bank
should be ready to finance a significantly higher proportion

of local costs.
Executing agencies also have to be assured that they can
“raise not only the investment costs for a project but also the
funds to operate and maintain it. It is often not possible to
recover investment and O&M costs of social sector projects
\ from beneficiaries ~ especially in education and health projects and: also in urban development and water supply

schemes.

One way to reduce the financial burden of executing

agencies in non-revenue generating social sector projects is
for the Bank io finance a larger share of (O&M costs. This
would help avoid underutilization of productive assets by the
poor and preclude the need to finance the rehabilitation of
facilities and equipment which deteriorate prematurely through
lack of maintenance. The foregone benefits and thus the costs
of such inefficient use of resources are in most cases higher
than the short-term benefits of installing new and additional
capacity which cannot be operated and maintained.

Similar arguments apply to the financing of operating
expenditures. Social infrastructure projects require large
outlays for operating the investments (for example, salaries
for teachers or medical personnel or the provision of teaching
materials or drugs). In fact, the investment cost of such a.project is usually a fraction of the total cost of delivering the services. At present, the Bank regards operating costs as a recurrent item; but from the viewpoint of the recipient, they are
an investment in human resources.

Status of Bank’s Efforts

Poverty-directed projects are difficult to implement, have
a long implementation period and require higher-than-usual
staff input. Implementation of the Task Force’s recommendations will be a major challenge for the Bank, and a cautious
approach will have to be adopted. The number of projects
and programs (including project components) specifically
designed to alleviate poverty will be expanded gradually as
the Bank gains experience in this field. Efforts have been made
to identify suitable projects and project components, as well
as to establish an inventory of technical assistance projects
which focus on beneficiaries and strengthening of local
capabilities.

Some of these efforts have resulted in projects which will
directly contribute to poverty alleviation, One such project,
approved in 1988, is the Forestry Sector Program loan in the
Philippines, which supports large-scale reforestation by using
labor-intensive methods and social forestry to discourage
deforestation by slash-and-burn methods. Other such projects
approved during the year, also in the Philippines, are the
Sorsogon Integrated Area Development Project and the NGOMicrocredit Project. These address the needs of the rural poor
through the provision of extremely small credits (mini-DFItype credits) channelled through NGOs. Other agriculture
projects under consideration for Bank assistance include 4

project for integrated development for low-income com- .

munities in the Philippines, a Kampong Improvernent Projed
in Malaysia, a Crop Diversification Credit Project in
Bangladesh, the Third Small Farmers Development Project
in Nepal and the Second Barani Area Development Project

in Pakistan. In the social infrastructure sector, projects in the .

Bank's pipeline include the Second Water Supply Sector
Project to benefit remote villages and communities in Nepal,!
primary education projects in Bangladesh and Pakistan, :‘the
Low-Income Housing Project in Pakistan and, the Health
Services Project in Bangladesh. Other projects aimed at both
helping the poor and protecting the environment are also being
considered. °

Loan and Equity Operations

BANK lending in 1988 was made up of project and multipro}ect loans, program and sector loans, credit lines through
development finance institutions (DFis) and agricultural credit.

Including private sector loans, Bank lending in 1988
amounted to $3,145.6 million, an increase of 29 per cent over
the previous year. Loans from ordinary capital resources
(OCR) totalled $2,062.2 million, a growth of 39 per cent over

in ADF loans came atter a year of strong growth and was
helped by loans to Indonesia, Pakistan and Philippines.

During the year, 61 loans were approved for 56 projects
in 18 developing member countries (DMCs). This compared
with 52 loans and 48 projects in 17 DMCs a year earlier. The
average size of loans increased to about $52 million from $47
million in 1987. The average size of OCK loans rose to $71
million from $67 million in 1987. The average size of ADF
toans increased slightly to $34 million from $32 million in the
same period.

Loans financed exclusively from OCR were provided to
People’s Republic of China, Fiji, India, Republic of Korea,
Malaysia and Thailand. Blended loans from OCR and ADF
were approved for Indonesia, Pakistan and Philippines. DMCs
which received loans exclusively from ADF were Bangladesh,
Bhutan, Kiribati, Lao PDR, Maldives, Nepal, SriLanka, Tonga
and Western Samoa.

Co-financing rose substantially to $774 million from $498
million in 1987 although the number of projects involving cofinancing fell to 17 from 25 in the same period. Official sources
of co-financing rose 138 per cent to $680 million from $286
million in 1987 and their share of total co-financing increased
to 88 per cent from 57 per cent-in the same period. Cofinancing from commercial sources, at $94 million, fell from
$212 million in 1987, or 12 per cent of the total compared
to 43 per cent the year earlier.

Loan projects appro¢ed during 1988 — including credit
lines, program and sector loans — had an estimated total cost
of $5.99 billion, of which 53 per cent was accounted for by
Bank financing, 34 per cent was to be provided by borrowing DMCs and 13 per cent by co-financiers.

Local cost financing in 1988 amounted to $564 million
for 23 projects in 10 DMCs. OCR provided $226 million of
this amount, and ADF $338 million, representing 11 per cent
and 31 per cent, respectively, of OCR and ADF loans
approved.

The Bank's cumulative lending by the end of 1988 had
reached $25 billion for 846 projects in 29 DMCs, of which
$16.8 billion was from OCR and $8.2 billion from ADF. About
$2.7 billion had been provided for local cost financing. The
Bank's equity operations, which began in 1983, had reached
a cumulative total of $77.4 million for investments and underwritings by the end of 1988.

The Bank’s Role in Resource Transfers
During 1988, the net transfer of resources — gross

disbursements minus repayments of principal, prepaymenis,
payments of interest and other charges plus equity investments

— by the Bank to DMCs rose sharply, due mainly to a signifi _

cant increase in disbursements of loans to.the public and
private sectors as well as equity investments to the private sector. Gross disbursements of loans and equity investments to
DMCs increased by 35.4 per cent to a record level of $1,674.3
million from $1,236.8 million in 1987. This strong disbursement performance was due largely to the expansion of quickdisbursing program loans, effective operations of Resident Offices and increased country projects review and disbursement

declined slightly fo $1,100 million in 1988, compared with
$1,106.9 million in 1987. As a result, the net transfer of
resources to DMCs rose to $574.3 million in 1988 from
$129.9 million a year earlier.

The Bank’s transfer of resources varied from country to
country. During 1988, 19 DMCs! received a positive net
transfer of resources. The amount of net resources transferred to these countries increased by 61.7 per cent to $940.4
million in 1988 from $581.6 million in 1987. During 1988,
the Bank recorded no resource transfers to Cambodia and
Hong Kong. The remaining eight DMCs,? however, experienced a negative transfer of resources because of nonlending to Afghanistan; Singapore; Taipei, China and Socialist
Republic of Viet Nam; a decline in disbursements and an increase in repayments in Malaysia; a fall in disbursements accompanied by prepayments from the Republic of Korea; and
an increase in repayments, including prepaymenis, in Philippines and Thailand.

Bangladesh ($208.5 million}, Sri Lanke ($57.4 million),
India ($52.7 million}, Nepal ($35.5 million) and Burma ($30.7
million). South Pacific DMCs! received a net transfer of
resources of $38.5 million. Disbursements to the Peopie’s
Republic of China ($2.6 million) began in 1988.

There was a considerable increase in the net transfer of
resources to Indonesia — a rise by $121 million, or 69.2 per
cent, over 1987 — due partly to the swift disbursements of
a program joan and partly to the effective function of the
Indonesia Resident Office in expediting the disbursemenis of

project loans. The increase in the net transfer of resources
. to Pakistan — by $91.5 million, or 77.6 per cent, over the
previous year — was due to the special efforts made by the
county io improve disbursements under project loans and

disbursements resulting from the simplification and streamlining of procurement procedures, the important role played
by the Bangiadesh Resident Office toward improved project

ioans. Among the South Pacific DMCs, Fiji experienced a shift
from 2 negative resource transfer (-$3.4 million in 1987} to
a positive resource transfer ($13.7 million in 1988) due to
the quick disbursements of a program ioan

There were negative net transfers of Bank resources to
Malaysia (-547.6 million), Philippines (-$45.2 million) and
Thailand (-$78.4 million) in 1988. Malaysia recorded an
increased negative resource transfer due to a decrease in
disbursements and an increase in repayments. The negative
net transfers of resources to the Philippines and Thailand were

attributable to a sharp increase in repayments, including “

prepayments.

fo Hong Kong and Singapore since 1981. The Republic of
Korea has received modest OCR lending since 1986, and has
indicated its intent to cease borrowing from the Bank from
1989 except in special circumstances. Due to non-lending or
a decline in lending commitments and increasing repayments
or prepayments, the net resource transfer to the NIEs as a
group has been negative since 1984.

Sectoral Review

Agriculture and agro-industry remains the most important sector of Bank operations, accounting for nearly one-third
of cumulative Bank lending and 49 per cent of its grantfinanced technical assistance. In 1988, its share of total lending
was 21 per cent, about the same as that of the previous year,
but the volume of lending rose to $674 million from $529
‘million in 1987. Given the primacy of agriculture in DMCs,
the uncertainty over the region’s food supply situation and
the emphasis on poverty alleviation, lending to agriculture is
expected to increase. ,

During 1988, 19 loans were approved for 18 projects.
Forestry and reforestation projects took a large share, 22 per
cent, of agriculture lending. Notable among these projects was
the forestry sector program loan to the Philippines, which is
aimed at assisting the Government's efforts to restore ravaged
forest cover and sustain vital ecosystems, Complementing this
loan was a technical assistance package for the formulation
of a master plan for forestry development and for studies on
plantation development and the rationalization of the woodbased industry. A second loan was extended to Malaysia for
its cornpensatory forestry sector project, which involves clearing and reforestation to provide a sustainable supply of timber
as well as environmental protection.

In Thailand, technical assistance was approved for an
innovative study to determine appropriate mechanisms for an
urgently-needed reforestation program which incorporates
private sector involvement. In Bhutan, technical assistance
was approved for the preparation of a master plan for forestry
development.

During the year, the Bank’s first direct support for nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) was introduced throughthe NGO-Microcredit project in the Philippines. This is aimed
at alleviating poverty through job creation, with women likely
to be the major beneficiaries.

The sustainabie development of water and land resources
an higher agricultural productivity through development and
fulier utilization of irrigation and flood control facilities continued to receive considerable emphasis in 1988. As for jand
resources, strategies for the development of highland
agriculture and effective management of sloping lands for
cultivation wil! be studied under two regional technical
assistance projects.

The rehabilitation of irrigation and flood control facilities
damaged by floods was the aim of one loan to Bangladesh.
Together with two other loans for the rehabilitation of flooddamaged rural infrastructure, the assistance reflected the
Bank’s pledge to aid Bangiadesh’s rehabilitation efforis
foliowing severe floods.

Policy reforms in the agriculture sector were supported
by two program loans to Fiji and Nepal. In Fiji, the reforms
were focused on agricultural diversification and growth and

strengthening the role of the private sector. The loan is
expected io develop downstream agriculture-based manuiacturing activities and increase the export of agricultural commodities and manufactured goods. A program loan to Nepal,
as well as two institutional-strengthening technical assistance
grants, will support a foodcrop production program and the
institution of policy reforms.

Technical assistance projects emphasized rehabilitation
efforts and the realization of productive potential. In Sri Lanka,
technical assistance was approved to prepare a loan project
for rehabilitation in the agriculture and fisheries sector following darnage caused by civil disturbances. Also in Sri Lanka,
technical assistance was provided to formulate strategies for
accelerating development in Southern Province. In Pakistan,
technical assistance was approved to formulate a rural
development strategy for the Sind Arid Zone.

Agricultural research received continuing emphasis. In
addition to research on the genetic improvement of tilapia (a
widely-cultivated food fish} , technical assistance was directed
at strengthening integrated pest management of Asian rice

farming systems, at furthering agricultural research cooperation in the South Pacific, and at establishing a collaborative
vegetable research program in Southeast Asia. These projects
are to be implemented mainly through regional agricultural
research centers.

Support for convening a regional forum to agree on
priority areas for animal health improvement policies and
strategies to support livestock development was the focus of
one technical assistance project.

Lending for industry and non-fuel minerals (including
development banks) rose sharply to a record $825.9 million,
due largely to three program loans totalling $465 million.
Loans to the private sector without government guarantee also
increased to $34 million from $20.5 million in 1987.

Three loans were approved to the People’s Republic of
China for industrial projects, but this trend will change as the
Bank switches its focus to infrastructure projects.

The Industrial Program loan of $65 million to Bangladesh
will support the Government's industrialization efforts. The
program includes reforms to stimulate growth in production
and exports, generate domestic savings, mobilize savings while
restraining the fiscal deficit, and redress problems facing financial institutions.

The Industrial Sector Program loan of $200 million to
Pakistan will support the Government's economic adjustment
program to maintain rapid industry-led growth through
deregulation and improved incentives. The program includes
reforms to stimulate private sector activities, promote exportoriented industrialization to ease balance-of-payment constraints, restructure the tariff system to encourage industrial
efficiency, improve public sector savings, and rationalize the
financial system to mobilize private sector savings for industrial
investments.

The Financial Sector Program loan of $200 million to
Indonesia is the Bank’s first prograrn loan to encourage financial sector policy reforms aimed at developing a more efficient and responsive financial system. The reforms include
liberalizing the entry of new financial institutions, reducing
restrictions on the range of financial services, streamlining the
legal framework for major segments of the money and capital
markets,“and promoting the development of the securities
market. The loan will support the Government’s reform program by providing balance-of-payments support and helping
to meet the increased import demand which is expected to
result from continuing deregulation in trade, industry and investment policies.

The Bank also continued to transfer resources to small
and medium-size productive enterprises in the private sector
through credit lines to selected financial intermediaries. Five
credit lines (other than agricultural credit) totalling $207.5
million were extended to development finance institutions
during the year. These included the first credit line extended
by the Bank to the newly-established Bhutan Development
Finance Corporation, amounting to $2.5 million. For Bhutan,
the Bank also approved a loan to develop industrial estates.

Various technical assistance grants were provided to support the program loans. A technical assistance grant to
Bangladesh was designed to deal with the environmental
aspects of the Industrial Program. Two advisory technical

assistance grants to Pakistan were for a study of regional
industrial potential and industrial pollution control policy and
a study to develop a disinvestment strategy for public
enterprises.

In addition, the Bank continued to assist in the development of DMC financial systems through technical assistance
for strengthening financial intermediaries, developing new
areas for assistance such as leasing, venture capital, regional
development banks and capital markets.

Lending to the transport and communications sector fell
by 20.6 per cent in 1988 to $630.4 million. Five projects were
approved for the airports and highways subsector, including
one sector loan for periodic maintenance of roads in Fiji and
a supplementary loan for the Second Tribhuvan International

The five project loans amounted to $425 million, excluding
a $22 miliion component under a Bank loan of $40 million
to Bangladesh for a flood damage restoration project, which
also covered the repair of roads damaged by the 1987 floods.
The iending for roads was mainly to promote regional development, support industrial activities linking productive agricultural
areas with population centers, and strengthen road
maintenance. These efforts were supplemented by 10
technical assistance projects totalling $6.3 million to carry out
feasibility studies, design work and neiwork planning for future
road projects as well as to strengthen concerned government
institutions and to enhance capabilities of domestic contractors.

In the ports, railways and communications subsector, the
Bank approved four loans totalling $205.4 million. A loan
of $135 million, the Bank’s first for the telecommunications
sector in India, was for an extensive modernization program,
including the introduction of state-of-the-art digital technology.
The Bank also approved a loan of $24 million to a private
sector enterprise, the Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Company, for an expansion program using the latest
technology.

In the railways subsector, the Bank approved a concessional loan of $40 million to Bangladesh to help the Government restore important roads in Dhaka and Chittagong and
railways on a countrywide basis which were damaged during
the 1987 floods. a

In the ports subsector, a concessional loan of $6.4 million
was approved for Male’ Port Development in Maldives, mainly
to increase capacity and ease congestion at the commercial
harbor. A technical assistance grant of $480,000 was also approved for the institutional strengthening of the Maldives Ports
Authority.

In addition, seven technical assistance projects were
approved, of which five were for the preparation of future
projects and two for advisory services and institutional
strengthening.

Bank assistance to the energy sector amounted to $567
million, comprising seven loan projects. In addition, 10

‘technical assistance projects were approved. Loan assistance
covered the improvement and expansion of power distribution facilities, as well as building new capacity for increased
production of electricity and natural gas. The technical
assistance projects addressed a wide range of activities such
as feasibility studies, pricing strategies, manpower development and demand management. The technical assistance
projects also included substantial support for preparing an
energy conservation program for energy-intensive industries
in the People’s Republic of China.

Lending to the social infrastructure sector more than tripled to $445.2 million in'1988. In the water supply and sanitation subsector, one loan of $20.65 million was approved for
a sewage treatment project in the Republic of Korea. The
project is the first stage of a sewage master plan for the cities
of Suweon and Jiniu, designed to help them continue
industrial and urban development with a minimum adverse
impact on the environment. In addition, 10 technical
assistance projects were approved, five of which were for
Project preparation, three for sector analyses and training and

two for regional assistance.

In the urban development and housing subsector, the
Bank approved a $175 million loan for a multi-component
integrated project for the city of Medan in Indonesia, the first
time an urban transportation component had been inciuded.
In addition, 12 technical assistance projects, totalling just over
$3 million, were approved covering a wide range oF project
preparatory and institutional support work including, for the
first time, assistance to e housing finance institution and
assistance for a tourism-reiated study. Further, a srudy was
completed updating an earlier urban sector profile for Indonesia, and field work for an urban profile study was undertaken in Sri Lanka.

In the health and population subsector, one joan — for
Indonesia — and four technical assistance projects were
approved. The iatter included a regional review of the
subsector.

In the education subsecior, the Bank approved five joan
projects in 1988. These covered restoration and rehabilitation works as well as upgrading of technicai manpower training in Sri Lanka, improving the quality and efficiency of education at the secondary and tertiary levels in the Philippines,
and developing professionai and high-level marine science
manpower in Indonesia. Technical assistance projects were
also approved for project preparatory, advisory and operational and regional purposes. In addition, two scholarship programs were established: one to provide postgraduate studies
in development-related fields (financed by the Government
of Japan), and the other to award short-term scholarships for
skills upgrading in the South Pacific DMCs and other smaller
DMCs. A sector paper was completed on Education and
Development in Asia and the Pacific to provide a basis for
future Bank operations in the sector.

Technical Assistance

Role of Technical Assistance and Its Funding

Technical assistance continued to play a key role in the
Bank's operations during 1988. Its main function is to facilitate
the transfer of resources and technology to DMCs by helping
them design, formulate. implement and operate development
projects. Technical assistance is also used to enhance DMC
capability to formulate economic development strategies,
policies, programs and plans to improve the allocation of
scarce domestic and external resources.

Technical assistance activities are financed by the Bank
through grants, loans and a combination of both. Funding for
grant-financed technical assistance activities comes from:
voluntary contributions to the Technical Assistance Special
Fund (TASF) from both developed and developing member
countries; allocations to TASF from ADF V; income from
OCR operations; the Japan Special Fund (JSF); and grant
funds provided by other multilateral and bilateral sources under
co-financing and exclusive financing arrangements.

Funding for loan-financed technical assistance comes
from OCR and ADF, together with other multilateral and

During 1988, a total of $169.5 million in technical
assistance loans and grants was provided for 206 projects,
including regional activities. Of this amount, $58.8 million was
grantfinanced ($30 million by the Bank, about $16.5 million
from the JSF and about $12.3 million from other sources)
and $110.7 million was loan-financed ($105.3 million by the
Bank and $5.4 million by co-financiers}.

Streamlining of Technical Assistance

During 1988, the Bank introduced various measures to
streamline further the financing and processing of technical
assistance activities, especially those financed on a grant basis.
In particular, a number of ceilings or limits of technical
assistance were raised, largely to reflect the increase in the
remuneration of consulting services financed by technical
assistance.

Until April, technical assistance for feasibility studies not
exceeding $150,000 had been financed fully as a grant. If
a technical assistance for feasibility study exceeded $150,000,
but was not more than $350,000, it would be financed initially
as a grant and, in the event a Bank !oan resulted, the amount
in excess of $150,000 would be refinanced from the Bank's
loan for the ensuing project. Since then, the grant limit of
$150,000 has been raised to $250,000, and the initial grant
ceiling from $350,000 to $600,000.

Under current practice, the President is authorized to
approve technical assistance grants financed by the Bank and
to approve the Bank’s administering technical assistance grants
financed by other sources, if the technical assistance does not
exceed a certain limit, does not involve any unusual obligation for the Bank or the recipient, and does not raise any issue
warranting Board consideration. In April, this delegated
authority of the President to approve technical assistance
grants was increased from $350,000 to $600,000.

The Bank has been providing grani-financed small-scale
technical assistance, usually for the updating of feasibilitystudies prepared by prospective borrowers and/or the filling
of information gaps in such studies or for financing advisory
and regional technical assistance of small size. In April, the
ceiling for such technical assistance grants was increased from
$75,000 to $100,000.

Aside from providing technical assistance for project
preparation relating to 2 single project, the Bank aiso finances
technica! assistance programs involving the preparation of
feasibility studies and/or detailed engineering of a number of
subprojects. Until April, such technical assistance programs
had been financed only by loans. Since then, technical
assistance programs have been financed by a combination of
grant and loan, and the grant portion will be allocated for
financing each feasibility study up to $250,000. The inclusion of grant financing for technical assistance programs has
made the financing of feasibility studies under such programs
consistent with similar studies financed on a stand-alone basis.
. Moreover, to encourage the utilization of the technical
-, agsistance program facility by DMCs, the Bank in December
allowed the refinancing of the loan component of a technical
assistance program from the investment loans for the subprojects resulting therefrom. This refinancing facility is now
_ consistent with the refinancing facility available for technical
assistance loans for individual projects from the resulting
“investment loans.

  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

‘Grant-Financed Technical Assistance

Technical assistance grants approved by the Bank
{funded by the Bank and other sources) totalled $58.8 million
-for 187 projects, including regional activities, in 1988. This
‘compares with $41.9 million for 141 projects approved in
1987, and brought the cumulative total to $339.3 million. Of
the 1988 tota! amount, 57 per cent was provided for advisory
and project implementation purposes, 27 per cent for project
preparation and 16 per cent for regional activities.

Forty-four per cent, or $21.7 million, of the total amount
of technical assistance grants to DMCs went to countries fully
eligible for ADF loans, a drop from 72 per cent in 1987. The
decrease was mainly due to the provision of increased
technical assistance grants to countries such as People’s
Republic of China, Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines.
India also received technical assistance for the first time in
1988.

The agriculture and agro-industry sector retained the
largest share of grant-financed technical assistance with 44 per
cent, a considerable increase over 31 per cent a year earlier.
This was followed by transport and communications with 19
per cent and social infrastructure with 16 per cent, compared
with 15 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively, a year earlier.
Industry and non-fuel minerals accounted for 13 per cent, an
increase from 10 per cent the previous year. Energy accounted
for 7.4 per cent, a big drop from 16.6 per cent the previous
year, and others 4.3 per cent.

The.Bank acts as the executing agency for most technical
assistance financed from other sources. Such projects were
financed in 1988 by agencies including the Danish International Development Agency, the Finnish International

 

Deveiopment Agency, the United Nations Development Programme anc the Governments of Norway and Switzerland.

The importance of technica’ assistance to.the Bank’s
overall jiending program is highlighted by the fact that, as of
the end of 1988, 374 Bank loan projects amounting to $11
billion had resulted from earlier project preparatory technical
assistance grants amounting to $76.5, million (the total amount
of project preparatory technical assistance approved was $260
million). In 1988, 22 Bank loan projects totalling $1,273
million resulted from technical assistance. Of this amount,
about $873 million came from OCR and $400 million from
ADF, representing 42 per cent and 37 per cent, respectively,
of OCR and ADF loans approved.

Regional technical assistance grants amounted to $9.6
million for 44 projects, up from $7.5 million for 39 projects
in 1987. During the year, 15.3 per cent of the total amount
of regional activities went to raining; 50.9 per cent to studies
and workshops; 19.7 per cent to research; 13.5 per cent to
conferences and seminars; and 0.6 per cent to other activities.
In 1988, 127 grant-financed technical assistance projects were
completed, bringing the total number of such projects to 878.

Loan-Financed Technical Assistance

During 1988, technical assistance components of loans
totalled $110.7 million for project implementation and
advisory*technical assistance activities, an increase of 9.6 per
cent over the previous year.

Group A (low-income) DMCs received about 41 per cent
of the total amount of loan-financed technical assistance
approved in 1988 compared with 35 per cent during 1987.
Group B (middle-income) DMCs received 58 per cent in 1988
compared with 59 per cent in 1987 and Group C (higherincome} DMCs received one per cent in 1988 compared with
six per cent in 1987.

The sectoral distribution of the total amount of loanfinanced technical assistance approved in 1988 included
59 per cent to social infrastructure, followed by 18 per cent
to transport and communications, nine per cent to industry
and non-fuel minerals and seven per cent each to agriculture
and energy.

dapan Special Fund

During the year, the Bank entered into a financial
arrangement with Japan and would administer the Japan
Special Fund (JSF}.

The objective of the JSF is to help DMCs restructure their
economies and broaden the scope of new investment opportunities in DMCs, assisting the recycling of funds to DMCs.
The JSF will support the efforts of DMCs toward indusirializetion, natural resources development, human resources
development and technology transfer. The fund will be used
to finance or co-finance technical assistance projects. on a
grant basis, whether in'the public or private sector, including
project preparation. advisory services and regional activities;
and, in special cases and on a grant basis, technical assistance

43components of public sector development projects financed
under loans from the Bank.

The JSF offers an important opportunity for the Bank
fo expand its technical assistance activities..An amount of
approximately $35.8 million was made available in April and
this resulted in a substantial increase in the Bank's overall
technical assistance program.

In the first year of administration of the fund, a total of
$16.5 million for 41 technical assistance grants was committed for technical assistance operations. This accounts for about
28 per cent of the total amount and 22 per cent of the total
number of technical assistance grants during the year.

Other Sources of Technical Assistance Grants

As in previous years, the Bank was able fo secure funding
from.other sources to supplement its grant resources (mainly
Technical Assistance Special Fund and OCR income) for
technical assistance operations. Such financing — either on
an exclusive or co-financed basis — was provided for technical
assistance activities in which the Bank acted as the executing
agency. The United Nations Development Programme was
an important source of funds, providing $9.2 million for 12
technical assistance projects, including $3.98 million for the
technical assistance component for seven loan projects. This
compared with $14 million’ for 17 projects, including $7 million
for the technical assistance cornponent of eight loan projects
a year earlier. Other sources included bilateral agencies such

approved for financing under the JSF.

interest in the areas covered by Bank technical assistance.

In 1988, such financing amounted to $12.3 million, or
21 per cent of all technical assistance grants approved during
the year, compared with $15.9 million, or 38 per cent, in
1987. Of this, $7.2 million for 13 projects was provided on
an exclusive financing basis and $5.1 million for eight projects was for co-financing with the Bank or the Japan Special
Fund.

Education, Training and Institutional
Development

The Bank considers human resource development as an
essential part of socioeconomic progress in its DMCs. This is
reflected in its efforts fo provide basic education for all, to frain
and develop manpower to be responsive to changing labor
and economic conditions as well as to the demands of science
and technology, and to build up the institutional capacity of
beneficiary agencies. In addition to direct assistance to the
education sector, the Bank supports built-in education, training and institutional development components in loan and
technical assistance projects in almost all sectors, and has
created other operational instruments, such as non-project
related scholarship programs.

In 1988, the Bank approved 56 loan projects of which
five were in the education sector while, of the others, 19 had
education and training componenis. In all, $210 million was
provided in the form of loans in the education sector, $21.5
million for education and training components of loan projects
in other sectors, and $7.8 million for technical assistance and
scholarship activities in support of education and training.

In the education sector, the Bank approved five loan
projects amounting to $210.2 million, which represents a
significant increase over past Bank lending for education. Bank
assistance ranged from the rehabilitation of school buildings,
as in the case of the Emergency Schools Restoration Project
in Sri Lanka {$15 million), to the improvement of quality and
efficiency of education and training, as in the cases of the
Agricultural Technology Education Project in the Philippines
($15.86 million}, the Second Technical Education Project in Sri Lanka ($36 million) and the Secondary Education
Development Sector loan in the Philippines ($70 million).
Bank support for education and training in the field of science
and technology was also evident in the Marine Sciences
Education Project in Indonesia {two loans totalling $73.35
million) where academic qualification and skills of teaching,

. support and administrative staff will be upgraded through short

and long-term training, About 106,000 teaching and
administrative staff and some 500,000 students are expected
to benefit each year from the Bank’s 1988 lending activities
in education, ,
Education and training components of loan projects in
other sectors were often designed to strengthen the institutional capacity of beneficiary institutions. For instance, about*'PUPILS at Port Moresby Business College are among the
beneficiaries of the Technical Education Project in Papua New
Guinea. The project, aimed at improving and expanding
technical education and apprentice training, was supported
by a Bank loan of $16 million

$1 million of the Agriculture Diversification Program loan in
Fiji was earmarked to train about 100 staff of the Ministries
of Agriculture, Forestry, and Finance and Economic Planning,
in project planning, formulation, monitoring and control.
Another example was the Small-Scale Industry Project in
Pakistan under which the Bank provided $650,000 for training courses to strengthen executing agencies’ capacity for
project identification, promotion and appraisal. A third
example was the Qingdao Tire Development Project in the
Peopie’s Republic of China, under which the Bank provided
$800,000 to train administrative and technical staff of
beneficiary agencies in the application of new process
technologies and modern industrial management.

About $7.8 million was also provided for education and
training in project preparatory, advisory and operational, and
regional technical assistance projects during the year. Technical
assistance was widely used to help overcome institutional,
educational and manpower weaknesses in DMCs. For exam
  

ple, the Regiona! Seminar on Monitoring and Evaiuation of

.Development Projects and Trainers Workshop provided a

forum for 30 senior representatives of executing agencies from
People’s Republic of China, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines and
Thaiiand to assess their respective capacity for monitoring and
evaluating development projects. Institution-building support
was also provided to Indonesia in the Strengthening of the
Industrial Information System of the Ministry of Industry
Project. under which about $36,000 was allocated for
overseas training in data collection and processing of industrial
information, and to the Indonesian Banking Development
Institute, for which $400,000 was allocated to prepare a
manual for market analysis of investment proposals in the
agro-industrial sector for the use of commercial and private
banks.

In 1988, seven technical assistance grants were approved
in the education sector. Some were for project-related studies
such as the Five Universities Development and Rehabilitation
Project in Indonesia ($450,000). Others addressed the needs
of DMCs in manpower development and helped to formulate
policies and strategies for the education and training sector.
Examples of the latter were a regional technical assistance of
$350,000 for the Preparation of Training Resources for
Accounting Technicians and $495,000 in advisory technical
assistance for a study of Technical and Vocational Education
Development in Pakistan. The Education and Training Sector
Study for Sri Lanka ($405,000) will assist the ‘Government
to devélop policies and strategies for the education and training
sector.

Scholarship Programs

The Bank, in its commitment to broaden its beneficiary
base, adopted a new operational instrument for education and
training — the scholarship program. Two such programs were
approved this year, the Asian Development Bank Scholarship Program financed by the Government of Japan and
administered by the Bank and the Bank-financed Scholarship
Program for Smaller DMCs. The Japan-ADB Scholarship
Program provides for postgraduate studies in development
related fields of study at a number of selected regional institutions for nationals of the Bank’s DMCs. Under the program,
for which $700,000 was made available for the first year,
scholarships were awarded to 49 nationals from 15 DMCs
during 1988. The Scholarship Program for Smaller DMCs,
for which a regional technical assistance in the amount of
$300,000 was approved, sponsors short-term scholarships in
specific fields of training for candidates nominated by the
Governments of Bhutan, Lao PDR, Maldives, and the eight
South Pacific DMCs, namely, Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati,
Papua New Guinea, Soiomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu and
Western Samoa. : .

Country Strategies and Policy Dialogue

The Bank continues to lay emphasis on country strategy
studies as the basis for its operations in DMCs. The studies

4546

examine the economic and social situation in the country concerned and, in the light of this and the Bank’s resources, provide a framework for Bank assistance. They also take into account current concerns of the Bank such as the alleviation
of poverty, adjustment and growth, the role of women and
non-governmental organizations.

During the year, the Bank revised some studies — the
first country strategy studies were prepared in 1985 — and
prepared new ones.

Work began on reviewing the strategy studies for
Bangladesh and Pakistan and these were due for completion
in early 1989, Country strategy studies for Malaysia, Nepal,
Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand were
completed.

One important aspect of country strategy is the role of
policy dialogue. This is the process through which the Bank
endeavors to enhance the quality of its operations by
improving the policy environment in DMCs. During 1988,
policy issues of concern in DMCs were discussed with
governments.

As a result of policy dialogue, efforts to secure a reduction in government subsidies in agriculture continued in Nepal,
Pakistan and Sti Lanka. Suitable pricing policies for public

utilities were stressed in discussions in Bangladesh, India, Lao

PDR and Philippines. Institutional-strengthening and sector
policy improvements were pursued in Bangladesh, Bhutan,
Pakistan and Philippines. Cost recovery of operations and
maintenance charges was partially achieved through policy
dialogue in Indonesia. Recognition of the role of privatization
and its advantages is also likely to emerge in the shipping sector.
in Fiji as a result of policy dialogue.

Private Sector Assistance Activities

Support for private enterprises increased substantially
during 1988, with approvals of loans and equity operations
almost double those of the previous year. Total Bank
approvals of direct private sector investments including equity,
underwriting and loans without government guarantee totalled

 

TOMATOES as seedlings (left) will be processed at a modern tomato paste factory in northeast Thailand (right), The Bank
has taken a 15 per cent equity stake in the enterprise and supported it with a $1.46 million lean.$94.7 million in 1988 compared with $48.1 million in 1987.
Loans to private companies and financial institutions totalled
$58 million while approvals of equity investments and equity
underwriting operations rose to $36.7 million, compared with
$20.5 million and $27.6 million, respectively, in 1987. The
Bank also approved equity investments totalling $3.5 million
in 10 projects under previously approved lines of equity.

Cumulative Board approvals of private sector operations
including a complementary loan of $5 million and excluding
cancellations amounted to $167 million as of 31 December
1988.

The equity investments and loans approved during the
year will assist private enterprises in seven DMCs as well as
a regional fund. In India, a petrochemical company received
a loan of $4 million and an equity investment of $3 million.
in Indonesia, a steel rolling mill received a loan of $15 million,
and two development banks were also assisted. An equity injection of $1.7 million was approved for one development
bank, while a second line of equity arnounting to $5 million
was approved for the other. In Pakistan, a leasing company
fin which the Bank has an equity investment) received a
. second direct loan amounting to $15 million to enable it to
expand lease financing of imported equipment. The Bank’s
first loan without government guarantee to a Philippine company will help the expansion and modernization of the country’s telecommunications system. Financial institutions were
assisted in several countries. In Sti Lanka, $330,000 is being
ected in the equity of a new insurance company and in
Thailand and Philippines, new venture capital companies were
assisted with equity investments of $1 million and $2.5 million,
tespectively. The Bank’s expanding operations with mutual
funds resulted in an underwriting of $5 million in a Thai fund
and a $15 million underwriting of a regional fund headquartered in Singapore.

Technical assistance grants were approved for three
privatization projects. In Solomon Islands and Western Samoa,
all government business-type activities are being reviewed with
a view toward rationalization, commercialization and privatization. The project in Western Samoa is a continuation of a 1986
project which has so far resulted in the privatization of four
companies. The Bank is also assisting the privatization efforts
of the Government in the Philippines. In connection with a
forest products project in Indonesia, the Bank approved a
technical assistance grant to advise the Ministry of Forests and
the project sponsors on the proper utilization of forest
Tesources.

To strengthen institutional aspects of financial intermediaries as well as to assist and enhance DMC capability
to formulate and implement economic development strategies,
policies and programs, 18 technical assistance projects
amounting to $3.22 million were approved during 1988. The
major ones were the regional technical assistance for the
Second Round Capital Market Study in Selected Developing
Member Countries and Study of Securities Market Institutions
in Selected Developing Member Countries. Other technical
assistance projects included Institutional Support to the Bhutan
Development Finance Corporation; Establishment of Domestic
Unit Trust in Sri Lanka; Credit Guarantee Scheme for SS&
in Pakistan: and Financial Sector Program in Indonesia.

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
  
    
   
   

Technical assistance was also approved for studies on venture
capital companies, the leasing industry and thrift banks. Two
regional technical assistance grants wére for project benefit
monitoring and evaluation for projects in devélopment finance
institutions and the industry and non-fuel minerals sector, and
the Study of the Impact of Exchange Risk on Development

Finance Institutions and their Sub-Borrowers and Measures’

to Minimize Risk.

The Bank's private sector operations, which have been
underway since 1983, were reviewed by the Board in dune
and some changes were made to allow more responsiveness
to private sector needs and to enable the Bank to play a more
effective catalytic role. As a result of the review, the Bank has
increased the amounts allocated for loans without government
guarantee and equity investments to $375 million from $145
million. The review also resulted in greater flexibility with
regard to size of equity investments and loans. The upper limit
for the percentage of a project's equity in which the Bank may
invest was increased to 25 per cent from 20 per cent and the
upper limit of $3 million was removed, as was the lower limit
of $100,000. :

Sirnilarly, the upper loan limit of $30 million for a project
was relaxed although that amount is retained as the normal
limit. Another significant change reduced the commitment fee
for loans to private companies to an effective 0.5 per cent
during the first year.

The above applies to direct investment and private financial and corporate projects, which, as indicated, is a rapidly
growing activity. Nonetheless, most assistance to private companies continues to be by way of credit lines to selected finandial intermediaries for relending to small and medium-size production enterprises.

In addition to its lending operations, the Bank approved
eight equity investments (six direct investments, two lines of
equity) and two underwriting commitments totalling $36.7
million. This will assist one private industrial enterprise, seven
financial institutions, one investment fund and one regional
fund. Notable was the Bank’s catalytic role in forming Thai
Agribusiness Venture Capital Company and H&Q Philippine
Ventures, two new venture capital operations designed to play
an important role in financing private enterprises. As of the
end of 1988, total cumulative equity investment and underwriting approvals stood at $77.4 million since the Bank began
equity operations in 1983.

ADF Lending Policy

In March, the Board approved the classification of
People’s Republic of China and India as Group A countries.

_This group of countries is normally eligible to borrow from

ADF resources because of low per capita income and limited
debt repayment capacity. Currently, however, it is not
envisaged that People’s Republic of China and India would
have access to ADF resources, although this situation would
be reviewed taking into account relevant factors such as the
likely availability of ADF resources and the requirements of
traditional borrowers from ADF.

Co-Financing

The number of projects which were co-financed fell to
17 in 1988 from 25 a year earlier. In terns of financial volume,
however, contributions of co-financiers rose 55 per cent to
$774 million in 1988 from $498 million in 1987, with the
Bank’s contribution decreasing to $842 million from $1,209
million in the same period. Official sources of co-financing
increased 138 per cent to $680 million from $286 million in
1987, and their share of total co-financing rose to 88 per cent
from 57 per cent. Co-financing from commercial sources
decreased to $94 million from $212 million in 1987, or to
12 per cent of the total compared with 43 per cent a year
earlier! As of the end of 1988, 259 Bank projects had
involved co-financing since Bank operations began in 1967,
with co-financiers providing approximately $7.1 billion and
the Bank $9.8 billion.

While economic growth in most of the Bank's DMCs continued to show improvement during the year, domestic
resource constraints and debt-service burdens continued to
have a restraining effect on commercial co-financing activities.
However, projects in sectors which are traditionally attractive
to co-financiers — such as those relating to power and energy,
including oil and gas, industry and development banks —- were
co-financed in 1988. Nine of the 17 co-financed projects were
in these sectors. In addition, there were four co-financed
projects in the agriculture and agro-industry sector, two in the
transport and communications sector, one in the social infrastructure sector and one involving additional co-financing
for 19 ongoing Bank-assisted projects in various sectors.

Bilateral sources such as the Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund of Japan, including the untied facility
channelled through the Export-Import Bank of Japan, and
the Governments of Canada, Finland, Switzerland and United
Kingdom continued to be tapped for co-financing, providing
$594 million for eight projects. Multilateral sources — the
International Finance Corporation, the OPEC Fund for
International Development, the United Nations Capital
Development Fund, the United Nations Development
Programme and the World Bank — provided $86 million for
seven projects.

Co-financing with export credit/commercial sources
decreased to $94 million, or 12 per cent of total co-financing,
for three projects, compared with $212 million, or 43 per cent,
for seven projects in 1987. With continuing economic growth
expected in the Bank's DMCs during 1989, co-financing from
these sources should increase since projects in the energy,
power and industrial sectors have been identified. In addition,
the Bank expects co-financing from commercial sources
utilizing the Bank’s guarantee facility to provide additional
resources from private financial institutions to co-finance both
project and program loans of the Bank. Such resources, under
the Bank's guarantee, will have more favorable terms, particularly manifested in longer maturities, than would other

Second Manila Port Project in the Philippines. The Bankassisted project is designed to ease congestion at the port.

wise be available to DMCs from these institutions. Such cofinancing will assist in easing DMC debt-service profiles in their
commercial borrowings.

Guarantee Operations

In February, the Bank approved a policy framework to
guarantee loans by private financial institutions to DMCs. The
framework for guarantee operations was approved in the light
of substantial balance-of-payments surpluses in some of the
Bank’s developed member countries and difficulties in many
DMCs in mobilizing sufficient resource flows on acceptable
terms to sustain economic recovery programs.

The guarantee operations are to be used only in selected
drcumstances and on a case-by-case basis. Their use will
enhance Bank efforts to promote resource flows by complementing the Bank's direct lending and co-financing operations. The provision of guarantees could play a role in
lengthening maturities of co-financed loans and in attractingadditional resources from private sources. :

The Bank guarantee is intended to cover up to a maxjmum of principal repayments and associated base interest
costs for maturities beyond the normal co-financing terms
available to the borrower. Guarantees will be extended only
as far as necessary to achieve the desired terms and conditions of the loans. Pricing of the guarantee will be based directly
on the benefits which the Bank’s guarantee provides in terms
of market-related factors

Bank guarantees will be used only for projects and programs in which the Bank participates. During the year, Bank
staff discussed the new facility with DMCs and appropriate
applications are expected to be developed in 1989.1

 
  
 
 
 
   
   
    
   
  
   
  
  

: Development Resource Center Activities

The scope of the Bank’s activities as a Development
Resource Center — which encompasses dissemination of information and assistance to DMCs for strengthening their institutions and improving their policies — was further expanded
in 1988.

Changes in the international economic environment led
to changes in priorities in the DMCs. Along with effective
resource mobilization, efficient resource allocation, and investment activities, the need for growth with equity was again
brought to the fore of the economic agenda. Ongoing policy
dialogue between the Bank and DMCs led to a better apprecia‘tion of these needs and the ways of coping with them. To
formalize this process of policy dialogue, a new forum was
created in the ADB Round Table on Development Strategies
{RTDS), which will be implemented from 1989. The firs
RTDS, for which preparatory work was started in 1988, will
bring together senior DMC government officials and the Bank’s
senior management to discuss current economic problems facing these countries and the possible role the Bank can play
in resolving these problems. Preparatory work was also under~.taken for holding another new Round Table in 1989 on the
: Role of Newly Industrialized Economies (NIEs) in Asian

Development, which will bring together representatives from
government, business and academia from the NIEs and Bank
management to identify areas of collaboration between the
Bank, the NIEs and the other DMCs.
The Bank’s research program continued to focus on
_ developmental problems of DMCs. In 1988, a number of
special studies were published: Towards Regional Coopera.. tion in South Asia; Evaluating Rice Market Intervention
Policies: Some Asian Examples; Improving Domestic
Resource Mobilization Through Financial Development
Nepal; Foreign Trade Barriers and Export Growth; Finaneing Public Sector Development Expenditures in Selected
Countries (eight volumes); and Study of Selected Industries.

The ongoing research work under the Bank’s technical
assistance program included The Role of Small and MediumScale Industries; Informal Credit Markets; Human Resources

Indonesia for its Financia! Sector Program, was approved by the Bank in
March 1989,

in Relation to Development; and Export Credit Financing
Schemes in the DMCs. The Bank also continued its participation and contribution to the LINK project, coordinated by
Nobel Laureate Lawrence Klein. i

The ADB Economic Staff Papers and Economics Office
Report Series continue to be important outlets for research
findings by Bank staff. The research reports published under
these two series during the year included: Recent Trends and
Issues on Foreign Direct Investment in Asian and Pacific
Developing Countries; Manufacturing Exports from the Philippines: A Sector Profile and An Agenda for Reform; Emerging Issues in Asia and Social Cost-Benefit Analysis; Shifting
Revealed Comparative Advantage: Experience of Asian and
Pacific Developing Countries: Agricultural Price Policy in Asia:
Issues and Areas of Reform; and A Survey of External Debi
Situation in Asian Developing Countries.

The Bank provided technical assistance to explore the
possibilities of systematizing research collaboration between
regional institutions and the Bank. To this end, the first
Regional Workshop on Monitoring National Research will be
convened in early 1989. In addition, the Bank provided
technical assistance for strengthening the industrial data base
in Malaysia, for improving agricultural statistics in the Philippines, and for improving short-term economic policy analysis
in Thailand. Furthermore, technical assistance was provided
for statistical manpower training in the South Pacific.

During the year, important contributions to development
issues wére published in the Asian Development Review which
was circulated to scholars and research institutions around the
world. A number of eminent development experts visited the
Bank to lecture under the Distinguished Speakers Program.
A new publication of the Bank, the Asien Development
Outlook, which will provide an in-depth analysis of the short
and medium-term outlook for DMCs, will be launched in
mid-1989.

Furthermore, a seminar on the Asian Economic Outlook,
which will be attended by concerned experts and will provide
inputs for the forthcoming Asian Development Outlook, is
planned for early 1989. :

The Bank provided financial assistance to the Pacific
Trade and Development Center and the Asian Productivity
Organization to support some of their research and training
programs. It collaborated with the East-West Center and the
Inter-American Development Bank to sponsor a conference
on Comparative Development Experience in Asia and Latin
America.

The Sixth Annual ADB Development Round Table on
“The Promotion of Medium and Small-Scale Industries for
Development” was convened by the Bank at its Headquarters
in Manila. This event brought a group of policymakers from
the DMCs together with a set of distinguished experts for
exchanging views and experiences on issues concerning small
and medium-scale industries in the region.

Environmental Planning and Management

The Bank initiated several activities in 1988 to strengthen
its environmental and natural resources planning and manage
4950

ment capability. The new moves included consolidating and
strengthening the environmental review process and operating
a comprehensive monitoring system throughout the project
cycle; designating Environment Unit contact persons in the
Projects and Programs divisions; integrating environmental
considerations in country programming exercises, particularly
in sectoral lending strategy and country strategy studies; incorporating environmental policy intervention in program
lending activities; and introducing the use of remote sensing
to enhance the design and management of loan and technical
assistance projects

New initiatives also included strengthening environmental
institutions and related line agencies, conducting country training and environmental projects; directing greater attention to
the environmental dimension of forestry projects, supporting
environmental projects which address poverty alleviation; supporting environmental education as an integral part of technical
and science training in the education systems of developing
member countries; and developing minimum quality criteria
for ecologically-sensitive areas.

During the year, the Bank also studied the Brundtland
Commission’s findings, environmental quality standards for
DMC use and environmental risk assessment. The Bank also
recognized the importance of greater cooperation with en
eee ee

TENDING seedlings in Western Samoa. Reforestation and conservation are the major objectives of the Forestry Development

vironmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
regional and international agencies, particularly in support of
environmental issues of regional and international concerns.

In view of the increasing awareness of the importance
of environmental and natural resources to economic development, the Bank is looking at longer-term issues to continue
promotion of sustainable development. These include an environmental policy to address emerging and future concerns:
the integration of environmental and natural resources planning and management into country economic and sector
work; programs for implementing minimum quality criteria
for ecologically-sensitive areas (including biodiversity and
tropical rain forests) and appropriate environmental quality
standards for DMC use; implementing the results of the
Brundtland study; incorporation of environmental risk assessment in the appraisal of development projects; applying the
geographic information system (GIS) to the management of
environmental and natural resources; and strengthening environmental and related line agencies, particularly to enhance
DMCs’ impact assessment and GIS capability. Resource center
work will continue as well as support for environmental
projects, environmental! forestry projects and those that directly
address poverty alleviation related to environment and natural
resources. Cooperation with environmental NGOs and other

 

Project which is supported by a concessional Bank loan of $1.74 million.regional and international agencies will be further strengthened. The Bank will host the 10th meeting of the Committee
of International Development Institutions on the Environment
{CIDIE) in June 1989.

Further emphasis by the Bank on environmental and
natura! resources planning and management will result in the
upgrading of the Environment Unit to Division status in 1989.

Through its Environment Unit, the Bank is committed
to: (i) instituting procedures for systematic environmental
examination of all its development activities, including policies,
programs and projecis, to ensure the incorporation of environmenial and natural resources planning and management
concerns; (ii) cooperating with DMCs to ensure that environmental protection measures are incorporated in the
design and implementation of projects; (iii) assisting DMCs
to establish and strengthen environmental and line agencies
concerned with monitoring and enforcing environmental laws
and regulations and in providing training to support these
activities; {iv) supporting environmental and natural resources
programs and projects; (v) training Bank staff in the environmental aspects of economic development; (vi) conducting studies to improve project processing and implementation; and (vii) cooperating with NGOs and bilateral and international agencies. The Bank's environmental policy continues
to provide a flexible operational framework in which to blend
the environmental dimension with the overall objectives of
socioeconomic development to ensure sustainable development and sound énvironmental and natural resources
management,

Women in Development

Following the Bank’s recruitment of a Project Specialist
in 1987 to serve as a focal point for Bank efforts to promote
women in development (WID), further progress was made
in implementing WID policy in 1988.

The Bank’s policy is principally directed at creating
employment and income-generating opportunities for women;
providing education, training and extension programs for
women; and extending credit schemes to women. Progress
was made in all these areas. In addition, specific WID considerations were incorporated into selected projects.

The Regional Study on the Role of Women in Rural
Industries, begun under a technical assistance approved in
1987 and implemented by the Center on Integrated Rural
Development for Asia and the Pacific, was completed during
the year. The study identifies constraints to women’s productive employment and outlines strategies for improvement in
this area, including a proposed investment program. In particular, it recommends promoting specific small-scale and cottage industries in Bangladesh and Nepal to provide incomegenerating opportunities for women. Follow-up action on the
report's findings and recommendations willl be taken in 1989.

Work also began on an action-oriented study in Bhutan
to examine the role and interests of women in general and
particularly in the livestock subsector. Findings will be incorporated into the ongoing Highland Livestock Development
Project to ensure effective women’s participation in project

activities.

In Pakistan, the feasibility study to promote girls’ primary
education was completed. This is the Bank’s first attempt to
provide infrastructure facilities exclusively for women.

in the Philippines, the NGO-Microcredit Project targets
women as the main beneficiaries.

Under Programs operations, a number of country programming missions held discussions with DMC governments
and WID issues were incorporated in country program papers.
The Bank's longer-term operational! strategy for Nepal was
prepared during 1988. and this includes a WID analysis in
a macroeconomic context. In addition, WID Country Briefing Papers were prepared for Fiji, Republic of Korea and
Philippines to assist staff in identifying and acting on WID issues
in each country.52

Work also began in preparing materials for a WID inhouse training seminar, The seminar will aim to promote staff
awareness and knowledge of WID issues and to develop skills
to incorporate relevant issues into operations, especially in the
preparation of projects.

Cooperation with NGOs

To promote continued cooperation with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the Bank approved in
April a technical assistance for a study of Cooperation with
NGOs in Agriculture/Rural Development. The study will identify, assess and develop working arrangements with specific
NGOs in Nepal and Philippines to achieve various objectives
in forthcorning agricultural projects. These consist of helping
to ensure that projects are specifically responsive to beneficiary
needs; helping to organize targeted beneficiaries and arrange
for their involvement and participation in project design and
implementation; and developing and implementing strategies
to enable these beneficiary groups to become self-help, selfreliant organizations.

In recognition of the important role played by environmental NGOs in economic and social development, an
informal meeting between senior Bank management and
representatives of selected environmental NGOs based in
Washington was held in March to exchange views on the
Bank’s environmental policies and programs and discuss how
environmental NGOs can help address environmental and
natural resources concerns in DMCs.

During the ninth meeting of the Committee of International Development Institutions on the Environment in
Washington, in June, a presentation was made on the ADB
study on cooperative arrangements with environmental
NGOs. The presentation dealt with the overall context in which
moves towards greater collaboration between the Bank and
environmental NGOs are taking place, opportunities for
obtaining concurrence of governments in these new
arrangements and ideas on how to secure greater cooperation.

The services of environmental NGOs were built into some
projects approved in 1988. These included the loan for the
Forestry Sector Program and the te¢hnical assistance for the
Manila Metropolitan Region Environmental Improvement
Study, both in the Philippines.

In conjunction with the Sorsogon Integrated Area
Development Project in the Philippines, the Bank agreed in
November to provide a $100,000 advisory technical assistance
grant for Community Mobilization and Development. The
technical assistance is aimed at establishing a pilot-scale community organizing program. Through an NGO, the program
will mobilize community groups in Sorsogon engaged in
economic activities in key sectors, namely, non-irrigated food
crops, tree crops, fisheries, small-scale agro-processing and
general services.

In December, the Bank extended a loan proposal to the
Philippines for the NGO-Microcredit Project. This was the
Bank’s first practical step in cooperating with NGOs to
strengthen and support the Government's Self-Employment
Loan Assistance Program. The $8 million pilot project will

finance micro-enterprises and cotiage industries using NGOs
as credit intermediaries as well as providers of technical
assistance. With this loan proposal, the Bank provided an advisory technical assistance for the institutional strengthening
of about 30 NGOs expected to be accredited under the project,
both for project implementation purposes as well as fo enhance
the effectiveness of the NGOs in their longer-term contribution to poverty alleviation.

Aid Coordination

The Bank’s DMCs continued to receive development
assistance from a large number of bilateral and multilateral
agencies apart from the Bank. As in previous years, continued
cooperation with various agencies is considered necessary to
share resources, expertise and experiences and to ensure that
activities are complementary. The Bank is continuing its efforts
fo cooperate with other agencies.

The Bank organized the Tenth ADB-World Bank Coordination Meeting in Manila to coincide with the Bank’s TwentyFirst Annual Meeting in April. The Bank was also represented
at the meeting of the Development Committee in Washington,
D.C., in April. The President attended the Development Committee Meeting and Heads of Multilateral Financial Institutions
Meeting in Berlin in September, during which he had consultations with the President of the World Bank.

>Funds from the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) continued to be an important source of grant
assistance for the Bank’s lending and technical assistance
operations. The Bank was represented at the UNDP Governing Council Meeting and Inter-Agency Consultative Meeting,
and contacts between Bank staff and UNDP resident offices
improved greatly, These contacts have facilitated cooperation
and resulted in a number of projects being co-financed with
the Bank.

As in previous years, the Bank participated in a number
of aid group meetings where aid agencies meet with government representatives to discuss economic and social
developments in DMCs, external financing and coordination.
in 1988, the Bank took part in such meetings for Bangladesh,
India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines
and Sri Lanka, including UNDP-sponsored Round Table
meetings for Bhutan, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Wester
Samoa. .

Since its establishment in 1982, the Bank’s Bangladesh
Resident Office {BRO} has participated in various local consuitative group meetings convened by the World Bank. BRO
has also convened regular meetings with other agencies on
the railways sector and has held monthly meetings with UNDP
on the processing of technical assistance projects.

Since the Indonesia Resident Office (IRO) opened in
1987, it has been involved in regular and coordination
meetings convened by various aid agencies with the objective of exchanging views on programs and coordinating
project-related activities.

The South Pacific Regional Office (SPRO}, since it
opened in 1984 in Port Vila, Vanuatu, has developed close
liaison with representatives of agencies based in various SouthPacific developing member countries. Bank missions from
SPRO frequently discuss program-related and other development issues with these representatives while in the field.

Annual consultations continued with the following
bilateral and multilateral institutions and governments;
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, International Fund
for Agricultural Development, Islamic Development Bank,
OPEC Fund for International Development, Export-Import
Bank of Japan and the Governments of Denmark, Finland,
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Consultations are an important link between the Bank and these
important sources of development funds and strengthen the
operational cooperation between the Bank and these governments and institutions. The Bank was represented at the Conference on Co-Financing and Cooperation with Developmert
Banks in Oslo.

The Bank’s Role in the 1990s

As a development finance institution, the Bank needs to
review periodically its future operational strategies and policies
in the light of the requirements of its DMCs.

In response to suggestions made by several Govemors
at the Twentieth Annual Meeting, the Board commissioned
a study of the role of the Bank in the 1990s financed by a
regional technical assistance. The objective of the study is to

assess the role and distinctive contribution of the Bank in
responding effectively and efficiently to the changing needs
of DMCs in the 1990s and to provide-a basis.for the Bank
to formulaie its operational directions, strategies and policies
for that decade. <

The study was conducted by a high-powered external
Panel of distinguished experts. The chairman of the Panel was
Mr, Saburo Okita from Japan. The other members of the
Panel were Mr. John Hennessy (United States), Mr. Emile
van Lennep (Netherlands), Mr. Mohammad Sadli (Indonesia)
and Mr. Amartya Sen (india). The Panel was assisted by two
senior consultants, Mr. Bong H. Kay (Republic of Korea) and
Mr. Robert Whitelaw (Australia).

After preliminary briefings and discussions, the Panel
began its work in early 1988. Five meetings were held during
the year, in January (Manila), Aprii (New York), July (Manila),
September (Berlin) and November (Tokyo). In the course of
its meetings in Manila, the Panel also exchanged views with
the Board, and with management and senior staff. The Panel
also met with the Governors in April (Manila) and September
(Berlin).

The Panel had nearly completed its task by the end of
the year. Its report was to be presented to the Bank after its
last meeting in Narita in January 1989.1

Introduction

THE Bank continued in 1988 to develop country strategies
for its prograrns of assistance to developing member countries (DMCs).1 Recognizing the need to direct its limited
resources to sectors and activities which best serve DMC
needs, and to maximize the development impact of its programs, the Bank undertakes in-depth couniry studies to design
mediurn-term operational strategies for Bank assistance. Major
policy issues have increasingly formed the basis of policy
dialogue between DMCs and the Bank and these discussions
have frequently resulted in-effective policy changes. In addition to describing the Bank’s operational strategies and programs for assistance, this chapter discusses the role of policy
dialogue where relevant.

Bangladesh

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational strategy
for Bangladesh is aimed at alleviating bottlenecks to growth
in the economic and social sectors. Assistance is focused, in
order of priority, on the agriculture, energy, transport, social
infrastructure and industry sectors. This sectoral emphasis is
consistent with the Government's Third Five-Year Plan
{FY 1986-1990).

In addition, the massive floods of recent years have provided an urgent need for Bank assistance in economic
reconstruction. Following the floods of 1987 and 1988, the
Bank approved three loans in 1988 for reconstruction/rehabilitation and is processing two loans for flood restoration works in 1989.

Agriculture is the top priority, as increased food production is a basic need, but Bank assistance is also directed at
crops other than foodgrain, livestock, fisheries and forestry.
Provision of agricultural credit and assistance for basic
agricultural infrastructure are also emphasized. Employment

and Viet Nam.

generating schemes are promoted to alleviate rural poverty.

In the energy sector, the Bank assists the development
of known gas fields and related transmission and distribution
facilities. In the power subsector, facilities for generation,
transmission and distribution are being developed or
rehabilitated. Rural electrification is emphasized to stimulate
income and employment creation in local communities. In

transport, various modes are assisted to improve the delivery’

of production inputs and outputs, especially in rural areas.
The Bank has indicated its interest in the co-financing of the
Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge which will accelerate development of the less-developed western zone. in the social sector,
Bank assistance is directed at primary education, women’s
education and technical education while health conditions are
improved through safe water supplies and environmenial
upgrading. In the industry sector, the Bank is primarily concerned with promoting private industrial investments through
development finance institutions (DFls}. Assistance is also pro

lending is ernphasized so that financial aid is accompanied by
policy reforms

The Bangladesh Resident Office, established in 1982,
continues to play a useful role in implementing the Bank's
operational strategy and facilitating project administration.

Policy Dialogue: Following discussions in which the
Bank and other donors urged the Government to reduce foodgrain and fertilizer subsidies, foodgrain subsidies were substantially reduced and the subsidy for urea, the main fertilizer, was
dropped. The Bank has stressed the importance of reducing
the large loan arrears of rural credit institutions to strengthen
their resource positions. In the energy sector, the Bank has
underscored concern over appropriate pricing of natural gas
and electricity, as well as the reduction of power system losses
and accounts receivable. These have been stressed in various
energy projects assisted by the Bank, including the proposed
Eighth Power Project. Significant progress has been achieved

in gas pricing but more effort is needed to reduce power system
losses and accounts receivable.

While the promotion of private industrial investments has
been a major policy of the Bank, the viability of the conduit
institutions is of great concern. The Bank has, therefore,
stressed in policy dialogue the need for institutional and financial reforms of the two main DFls in the sector, the Bangladesh
Shilpa Bank and the Bangladesh Shilpa Kin Sangstha. The
performance of these institutions, especially in loan recoveries,
has resulted in the suspension of foreign assistance to them
since 1985 and the Bank has been carrying out reform programs financed by UNDP.

Loans and Technical Assistance: Bank lending to
Bangladesh in 1988 amounted to $267.5 million for six loans
from ADF. Four projects were in agriculture, with one in
transport and communications and one in industry. This compared with $265.7 million for four loans in 1987. Local currency financing amounting to $129.2 million was provided
for five projects. Co-financing for $75,000 was arranged with
UNDP for consulting services for a flood rehabilitation (flood
control and irrigation) project.

In the agriculture sector, two loans will assist flood restoration works. One project will rehabilitate flood control and irtigation facilities in the southwestern region of Bangladesh
damaged by the 1987 floods while the Flood Rehabilitation
(Rural Infrastructure) Project will assist the rehabilitation of rural
infrastructure in northeast and southwest Bangladesh damaged
by the 1987 and 1988 floods.

The Rural Infrastructure Development Project will provide better rural transportation and a marketing network in
two northern districts populated largely by small and mediumscale farmers and landless laborers. Under the supplementary loan for the Meghna-Dhonagoda Irrigation Project, flood
protection, drainage and irrigation facilities will be provided
to 17,000 hectares of agricultural land in the southwestern
region. Under the Flood Damage Restoration (Roads and
Railways) Project, important road and railway links damaged
by the 1987 floods will be restored.

The Industrial Program loan will bolster the Government's
liberalization program and bring about policy reforms aimed
at stimulating growth in industry, production and exports,
generating domestic savings, mobilizing revenue while restraining fiscal deficit, and addressing problems facing financial
institutions,

Four technical assistance grants amounting to $4 million
were approved in 1988. Three were advisory technical
assistance and one project preparatory.

As of the end of 1988, the Bank had approved 79 loans
to Bangladesh, amounting to $2,460 million for 71 projects.
Of this amount, $11.4 million was from OCR and $2,448.8
million from ADF. The Bank had also provided technical
assistance amounting to $46.6 million for 97 projects, of which
39 had resulted in Bank loans.

Project Implementation: Of the 79 loans {including
one special assistance loan) approved to Bangladesh as of 31
December 1988, 31 had been closed and 48 were under
administration, of which two were awaiting loan effectivity.Bangladesh: Lending and Disbursements

releasing local funds, revising certain customs duty-related
rules and increasing the level of authority of project officers
of externally funded projects — as suggested in earlier country
‘projects review meetings — greatly helped to improve absorp‘tion of Bank loans. A seminar on procurement and disbursement was held in Dhaka during November and was attended
by 30 senior officials responsible for implementing Bankfinanced projects.

Bhutan

Operational Strategy: The long-term objectives of
Bank lending and technical assistance operations in Bhutan
are to help improve the capacity of key minisiries and development institutions, promote the development of physical and
social infrastructure, gradually deveiop a subsistence
agriculture system into a market-oriented production system
and develop selected export-oriented industries using
indigenous raw materials.

Policy Dialogue: Discussions with the Government
concentrated on three studies, undertaken under Bank
technical assistance, of agricultural input subsidies, cost
recovery for public services and urban housing. Topics identified for future policy dialogue are issues related to the financiai
sector, environmeniai protection and private sector promotion.

Loans and Technical Assistance: During 1988, the
Bank approved two loans to Bhutan amounting to $3.65
million, compared with one loan of $3.3 million in 1987. The
projects were designed to upgrade several industrial estates
and to provide foreign currency funds to Bhutan Development Finance Corporation (BDFC) for supplementary small
and medium-scale industrial enterprises in the private sector.
The Bank also approved seven technical assistance projects,
totalling $1.69 million, to prepare a housing finance project,
to strengthen key institutions such’ as the Department of
National Budget and Accounts of the Ministry of Finance, the
Department of Trade and Industry, and the BDFC, and to
draw up a master plan for Forestry Development and Women
in Development profiles in the livestock subsector. To date,
Bank lending to Bhutan amounts to $31.6 million in eight
loans and technical assistance totals $8.9 million for 28
projects.

Cumulative disbursements of Bank loans amounted to $9.8

Projects were generally being implemented without
serious problems although there were delays in procurement
and in submission of audited financial statements. The major
areas of constraint are the unfamiliarity of government officials
with Bank procedures and the shortage of qualified manpower. The Bank’s approach is to provide technical assistance
to mitigate the manpower problem and seminars to familiarize
executing agency staff with Bank policies and procedures. A
seminar on procurement and disbursement was held in
Thimpu during February.

Burma

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational strategy
for Burma is to promote and diversify export-oriented activities
and to provide a sound infrastructural base on which to support developments in all sectors, including private investment.
Bank assistance is primarily focused on the energy and
agriculture sectors but support is also provided for projects
in the financial, health, water supply and sanitation, and
transport and communications sectors.

Policy Dialogue: In 1988, the Bank discussed with the
Government issues in the agriculture sector relating to the processing of an agriculture program loan. These discussions were
interrupted, however, by political events in mid-year.

During the first half of the year, disbursements proceeded
at a satisfactory pace. However, after the mid-year political
events, disbursements slowed considerably. From August, no
loan administration mission visited Burma but the situation
was being closely monitored.

China, People’s Republic of wee

Operational Strategy: Tne Bank’s operational strategy
in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is aimed at supporting the Government’s ongoing restructuring program by providing financial assistance to the three key sectors of industry
(including export-oriented agro-industry), energy and
transport. These sectors have an important role to play in the
realization of the PRC's objective of attaining the status of a
middle-income developing country by the year 2000. The industry sector suffers from growing product obsolescence, antiquated technology and low productivity. The energy sector
is characterized by high energy use, inadequate power capacity and inefficient transmission facilities. The problems facing
the transport sector are an overburdened railway system,
inadequate port handling capacity and limited road transport
capacity. The Bank's involvement in the transport sector aims
at alleviating distributional bottlenecks in the shipment of coal
which hamper industrial growth and power generation, particularly in the eastern region where the Bank is concentrating
operational activities.

In addition, the Bank is helping to strengthen the institutional capabilities of relevant agencies to adapt to a more
market-oriented and outward-looking environment as a result
of recent reforms. In the current stage of economic reforms,
the process of economic management and planning is
undergoing a major change. Direct contro] of economic
activities is being replaced by increased reliance ona variety
of indirect controls and macroeconomic policy instruments.
The Bank, in this regard, will also help the relevant agencies
to use economic instruments to evaluate economic policies.

Policy Dialogue: Even though Bank operations in the
PRC are of relatively recent origin, the Bank has already
established, on an ongoing basis, policy dialogue with the
Government at various levels. Such dialogue has resulted in
wider sectoral involvement for Bank operations, for example,
in infrastructure and energy in addition to industry. Policy
dialogue was also undertaken in the development of individual
projects and has covered important policy matters such as
product pricing (the Nanning Integrated Pigment Project and
Hexian Pulp Mill Project), power tariffs (Fuel Conversion
Project), energy-saving measures (Industry Energy Conservation Program) and accounting methods and procedures
(Fuel Conversion Project) and several technical assistance
projects. The Bank was also to undertake a Country Strategy
Study in the PRC and, in the course of this, the Bank and
the Government wili have further opportunities to continue
policy-oriented discussions in a macro as well as a sectoral
context.

Loans and Technical Assistance: Bank lending to
the PRC totalled $282.9 million for four loans in 1988, compared with $133.3 million for two loans in 1987, the first year
of Bank operations. The industry {including development
finance institutions) and agro-industry sectors accounted for
all of Bank lending in 1988. One project involved co-financing
of $50 milion with the Export-Import Bank of Japan. The

to expand and modernize production facilities. The Hexian
Pulp Mill Project will establish a chemical pulp mill to supply
pulp for paper production by using locally-produced pine. In
3988, the Bank also extended the first line of equity to SITCO
for $3 million to finance from its own account equity
investments in privately-owned enterprises in the industry and
service sectors.

The Bank also approved $3.4 million in technical
assistance for 10 projects. Advisory and operational assistance
amounted to $3.1 million for seven projects and project
preparatory technical assistance totalled $294,000 for three
projects. Three of these projects were in the energy sector,
one in social infrastructure, two each in agriculture/agroindustry and transport and one in industry. One was for the
State Statistical Bureau, aimed at helping to develop its institutional capability.

Project Implementation: As of 31 December 1938,
all six loans approved to the People’s Republic of China were
still under implementation. Four loans made in 1988 were
awaiting effectivity. Cumulative contract awards, all made in
1988, totalled $25.4 million, or 20 per cent of the net effective loan amount. The Bank made its first disbursements in
1988 amounting to $2.7 million, or 2.1 per cent of the fotal
amount of net effective loans.

Implementation of the first loan, a $100 million credit
to China Investment Bank, was proceeding satisfactorily. Procurement under the Fuel Conversion Project was proceeding
smoothly. Several delegations from executing agencies and
government departments concerned with procurement and
project implementation visited the Bank for briefing on pro
curement and consultant recruitment. The Bank also conducted a seminar on procurement in Beijing which was attended by 30 officials.

Operational Strategy: The Bank supports the
Government's long-term objectives of economic diversification and employment generation. In the short term, the Bank's
strategy is also to assist the Government to revitalize the
economically productive sector in the wake of the slackening
of private sector development due to recent political
developments. This will be achieved by focusing Bank lending
and technical assistance activities on diversifying the agriculture
sector, the country’s main economic base, improving
agricultural productivity and developing supportirig infrastructure. The Bank’s strategy also emphasizes the role of the
private sector directly or indirectly through development
finance institutions and seeks to revitalize tourism activities.

Policy Dialogue: Discussions on issues in the
agriculture sector were carried out with the Government in
connection with the Agriculture Diversification Program aimed
at restructuring the agriculture sector by expanding, intensifying and diversifying agricultural production and increasing
the role of the private sector. in addition, the Bank held discussions on policies relating to technical assistance for the
Privatization of Government Shipping Fleet and Commercialization of Government Shipyard and the Study of Development of Capital Market. Tariff issues in the power sector and
a road user cost recovery scheme were also discussed,

Loans and Technical Assistance: Two loans were
approved for Fiji in 1988. Cumulatively, as of year-end, the
Bank had approved 10 loans amounting to $93.5 million for10 projects. The energy sector accounted for nearly 40 per
cent of cumulative Bank lending, followed by the agriculture
sector at nearly 30 per cent. In 1988, technical assistance
totalling $1.5 million was provided for five projects, of which
one was for project preparation and four were advisory and
operational in nature. As of end-1988, the Bank had provid

which eight were for project preparation and 13 were for advisory and operational purposes.

Project Implementation: Of the 10 loans approved
for Fiji, six had been closed and four were under administration at the end of 1988. Contract awards amounted to $24.6
million, bringing cumulative contract awards to $73 million
or 84 per cent of the net effective loan amount. Disbursements
totalled $20.9 million, of which $20 million was under the
Agriculture Diversification Program, compared with $2.9
million in 1987. Cumulative disbursements of Bank loans
amounted to $69 million or 79 per cent of the total amount
of net effective loans

Implementation was generally satisfactory, although two
Projects in the agriculture sector were adversely affected by
budgetary constraints. The Government carried out most of
the policy reforms agreed under the Agriculture Diversification Program and the loan has been fully disbursed.

India

Operational Strategy: The Bank's role in India’s
development process is to provide well-directed and sustained
financial assistance in consonance with the Government's objectives, priorities and programs. The Bank’s operational
strategy focuses on India’s rapid industrialization of the
economy, one of the Government's most important objectives. Assistance is aimed at improving the structure of the
industrial sector and making more efficient use of productive
capacity to increase industry’s share of GDP, export earnings
and employment. Priority is being given to industries that can
play a major role in the modernization of the industrial sector
and in stimulating growth in other sectors, with an emphasis
on the development of private sector manufacturing. Support
for manufacturing has been channelled mainly through
development finance institutions and also through equity investment and direct lending to the private sector

6162

Assistance is also directed at alleviating infrastructure constraints to: the growth of industry, for example, through
assistance for improved and expanded facilities in the power,
transport and telecommunications sectors which will in turn
support the further development of industry.

Policy Dialogue: Under ongoing policy dialogue, the
Bank has been discussing with the Government measures the
latter has introduced or proposed in order to resolve various
policy issues, During the year, the Bank prepared profiles of
the power and finance sectors and, in 1989, the Bank plans
to complete a ports and shipping sector study for which
technical assistance was approved during 1988. These studies
will help to identify important sector issues and provide recommendations for discussion with the Indian authorities. In
addition, the Bank was to prepare in 1989 an operational
strategy study for its program in India to determine further
the most effective contribution the Bank can make to India’s
development.

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1988, the Bank
made four loans from OCR, including one loan to the private
sector without government guarantee, totalling $497 million.
This brought cumulative lending to India, which began in
1986, to $1,140.6 million. One loan of $135 million was provided to develop long-distance telecommunications facilities.
One loan of $160 million was to develop additional thermal
generating capacity in Uttar Pradesh. One loan of $198 million
was to upgrade roads which support industrial activity in
various parts of India; the Bank is also financing $113 million
of local costs in this loan. One loan of $4 million was for
petrochemical development by a private company and this
also involved an equity investment of $3 million.

Four technical assistance projects, the first to be provided
under the Bank’s program to India, were approved during
the year. Totalling $645,500, their respective purposes were
to prepare a road project, prepare an acrylic fiber project,
undertake a study of the ports and shipping sector and help
develop a finance sector profile.

Project Implementation: All 10 loans approved for
India by the end of 1988 were under administration, of which

Disbursements increased significantly to $56.4 million from
$11.6 million in 1987, reflecting the quickening pace of Bank
operations in India. Cumulative disbursements amounted to
$68 million or 8.7 per cent of the total amount of net effective
loans.

The first country seminar on procurement was held in
New Delhi and was attended by 29 officials. implementation
of the Bank's first loan, a $100 million loan to the Industrial
Credit and Investment Corporation of India Limited, progressed satisfactorily and the entire loan is expected to be committed by the end of 1989. Three projects in the transport
and communications sector are in the initial stage of
implementation.

Indonesia

Operational Sirategy: The Bank’s operational strategy
is aimed primarily at diversifying Indonesia's economic base
fo reduce its overdependence on oil, improve economic efficiency and generate employment opportunities for a Jabor
force growing by about two million per year. Investments in
industry, agriculture and services are essential if these objectives are to be achieved. The strategy also recommends investments in energy and human capital development and
selective investments in physical infrastructure to support the
efficient diversification of the production sectors.

On a sectoral basis, in view of its contributions to employment and exports, agriculture is an important area for Bank
assistance. The strategy recommends Bank support for
agricultural diversification to maintain food stability and promote non-oil exports. In industry and finance, the Bank
strategy is to support government efforts to promote and sustain diversified, efficient and internationally-competitive
sectors. In energy, the strategy emphasizes resource diver
‘sification and energy conservation. Education, including man
power and institutional development, is given high priority in
view of the critical shortages of manpower that pervade the
economy. Health and urban development merit increased
support because they represent investments in human capital
and opportunities to alleviate poverty. In physical infrastructure, the strategy recommends limited assistance to roads
and ports.

Policy Dialogue: In 1988, the Government and the
Bank continued discussions on fertilizer and pesticide subsidies.
During the year, domestic retail prices of fertilizer and
pesticides were increased in line with international prices.
Interaction on policy issues in the financial sector and agreement on a package of reforms resulted in the Bank's approval
of the Financial Sector Program.

One of the major problems in the implementation of proj
ects is the delay in the award of contracts for goods and services and measures to remove these bottlenecks were dis
. cussed with the Government within the framework of general

country projects review and consultation missions. With theabolition of the central government procurement team in
1988, the situation considerably improved, as reflected in the
significant increase in contract awards.

Loans and Technical Assistance: Bank lending to
Indonesia increased slightly to $580.1 million from $576
million in 1987. Of this, $500 million was from OCR and
580.1 million from ADF. The ADF resources were allocated
to a project in the education sector and for the financial sector
program. Overall, nine loans were approved for six projects
and one prograrn in 1988. Included is a loan without government guarantee to P.T. Gunung Garuda. Local cost financing
amounted to $127.1 million and the Bank financed 80 per

 

PUMPING station at the Semarang Water Supply Project in
Central Java, Indonesia. The project, which is expanding the
supply of potable water to 200.000 people, is being supported
by a Bank foan of $35.5 million.

* Sectorally, the industry and finance sector accounted for
37 per cent of the 1988 Bank lending, followed by urban
development (30 per cent), agriculture (13 per cent), education (13 per cent), and health and population (seven per cent).
The program loan was aimed at supporting the Government's
program of financial sector reforms. The loan proceeds will
provide balance-of-payments support to the Government and
assist in meeting the increased import demand expected as
a result of continuing deregulation of trade, industry and
investment. The urban development project will improve living
conditions, particularly for low-income groups, in.the city of
Medan and surrounding small towns, through the improvement and extension of urban infrastructure services. One of
the two agriculture projects is aired at expanding, modernizing and balancing the facilities for agro-based industries and
encouraging greater involvement of the private sector. The
other loan will promote and upgrade the development of
smallholder cocoa/coconut estate crops to provide a sustainable source of income to a large number of disadvantaged
smallholders. The education project will improve the quality
and supply of marine manpower at the professional level and
upgrade marine science education programs at six universities.
The health and population loan is designed to improve
delivery of health care and family planning services in selected
areas.

In 1988, the Bank also approved $6.5 million in technical
assistance for 23 projects, compared with $3.8 million-for 13
projects in 1987. Project preparatory technical .assistarice
totalled $3.2 million for 13 projects, and advisory and operational technical assistance amounted to $3.4 million for 10
projects. Five projects were in agriculture, four-each in industry

6364

and non-fuel minerals and urban development, three in
development banks, two each in education and energy and
one each in ports, environment and water supply.

As of the end of 1988, the Bank had approved 134 loans
totalling $4,929 million for 124 projects. Of these, 107
amounting to $4,551.8 million were from OCR and 27 totalling $377.4 million were from ADF. The Bank had also provided technical assistance totalling $33.4 million for 150
projects, of which 74 resulted in Bank loans amounting to
$3,373 million. Bank lending activities have generally followed
the Bank's operational strategy in Indonesia and the country’s development plans, with agriculture accounting for almost
35 per cent of cumulative Bank lending, followed by social
infrastructure (22 per cent), transport and communications
(16 per cent), energy (15 per cent), and industry and nonfuel minerals, including development banks (12 per cent).

Project Implementation: Of the 134 loans approved
for Indonesia, 65 had been closed and 69 were under
administration at the end of 1988, of which eight were awaiting
effectivity. Six loans were closed during 1988. Contract awards

awards to $2,372.5 million or 60 per cent of the net effective
loan amount, Disbursements totalled $530 million, compared
with $352.4 million in 1987. Cumulative disbursements of
Bank loans amounted to $2,038.8 million or 52 per cent of
the cumulative amount available for withdrawal.

The large increase in disbursements reflected a significant improvement in implementation. The Government made
a number of policy decisions to simplify and expedite procurement and consultant recruitment. These included
streamlining procedures and delegating higher levels of
authority to project officials. The Government also showed
greater willingness to allow the use of imprest accounts, with
suitable modifications, in the near future.

The Indonesia Resident Office (RO), established in 1987,
contributed to the improvement by working closely with the
executing agencies and assisting in implementation. The RO
introduced a comprehensive project monitoring system, including a monthly report on the status of project implementation which is submitted to BAPPENAS, the central planning agency. The Bank continued to conduct semi-annual
country projects review missions to discuss cross-secioral implementation issues and problems with government officials.

Korea, Republic of

- Operational Strategy: One of the main objectives of

the Bank strategy has been to assist the Government in
promoting balanced regional development. in this connection, the Bank approved loans for sewage and road improvement in 1988. Continuing strong economic growth has
brought about an increase in the Republic of Korea’s domestic
savings and a surplus in its balance of payments.
Consequently, the demand for extemal assistance dropped
sharply and this prompted the Government to decide to cease
borrowing from the Bank after 1988.

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1988, the Bank
approved two loans totalling $120.65 million from OCR, compared with three loans totalling $133.2 million in 1987.

Balanced regional development will be supported by the
fifth road improvement and the fifth sewage treatment projects.
The latter will also assist environmental protection. The Bank's
technical assistance consisted of one advisory technical
assistance grant of $350,000 to help set up a training system
for sewage treatment operators.

By the end of 1988, the Bank had approved 79 loans
totalling $2,323.4 million to the Republic of Korea. Of these,
78 loans totalling $2,319.7 million were from OCR and one
loan of $3.7 million was from ADF. The Bank made three
direct equity investments and provided one line of equity totalling $9.19 million. The Bank had also provided 33 technical
assistance grants totalling $5 million. Of these, seven were
for advisory and operational purposes ($2.1 million) and 26
for the preparation of projects ($2.9 million), of which 21
resulted in 24 Bank loans amounting to $872.4 million. Of
the Bank's total lending, two-thirds has been in sectors directly
supporting industrialization efforts — industry, development

banks, energy and transport. In recent years, the Government
has increased investment in the social infrastructure sector
This change was reflected in Bank lending and, since 1977,
one-third of its assistance was for social infrastructure. The
major objective of this assistance was to support government
efforts to improve living conditions in provincial and rural areas
and thus promote balanced regional development. There was
also a rise in Bank lending to the energy sector to reduce
dependence on imported oil

While the Government has decided to cease borrowing
from the Bank, it has expressed the desire to continue
cooperation in a different dimension in the future. The
Republic of Korea’s decision to cease borrowing marks the
country’s successful transformation from one of the highly
indebted nations in Asia to a capital-exporting country

Project Implementation: Of the 79 loans approved
to the Republic of Korea, 67 had been closed and 12 were
under administration at the end of 1988. Contract awards
amounted to $97.2 million, bringing cumulative contract
awards to $1,611.7 million or 93 per cent of the net effective
loan amount. Disbursements totalled $24.7 million, compared

Lao People’s Democratic Republic

Operational Strategy: The main objectives of the
Bank's operational strategy for Lao PDR are to improve and
expand basic infrastructure to achieve a better integration of
the economy and to stimulate production and trade; to
increase foreign exchange earnings by developing and diversifying exports; and to provide assistance for institution-building
and human resources development.

Bank assistance over the past five years has focused on
the development of roads, power generation for export and
domestic consumption, power transmission and distribution
facilities, and forestry and wood processing. In line with the

strategy’s objectives, the Bank will continue to assist these sectors, but will also support diversification of a paddy-oriented
agriculture sector, agro-processing, forest conservation and
replanting, small manufacturing and education.

Policy Dialogue: During processing of the Nam NgumLuang Prabang Power Transmission Project, the Bank discussed with the Government the operational and financial performance of Electricité du Laos (EdL) and agreed on the need
for gradual increases in EdL.’s domestic tariffs to maintain EdL’s
satisfactory financial position, Also in 1988, the Bank initiated
policy dialogue related to an agriculture program loan which
the Bank expects to consider in 1989. Finally, monetary and
financial sector issues were addressed during the processing
in 1988 of a technical assistance, to be approved in 1989,
for the restructuring of the monetary and banking system
which would assist the Government in reorganizing and
strengthening the country’s banking system through the
separation of the State Bank’s central and commercial/development banking functions.

Loan and Technical Assistance: !n 1988, the Bank
approved one loan of $11 million, co-financed by the Government of Switzerland in the amount of $800,000, for the Nam
Ngum-Luang Prabang Power Transmission Project. The
project is aimed at providing a 115 kV single power transmission tine from the Nam Ngum Hydropower Station to the city
of Luang Prabang via Vang Vieng, associated terminal facilities
at Nam Ngum and Luang Prabang and substation facilities
at Vang Vieng and Luang Prabang. The Bank provided one
project preparatory technical assistance of $350,000 for a
feasibility study to improve the road between Vang Vieng,
north of Vientiane, to Pak Mong in the north via Luang
Prabang. The Bank also provided a small-scale advisory
technical assistance of $12,000 to help the Government in
preparatory work for restructuring the country’s financial and
banking system.

Project Implementation: Of the 16 loans approved
to Lao PDR, eight had been closed and eight were under administration at the end of 1988. One loan was closed in 1988.

Operational Strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy
was reformulated in 1987 after reviewing the Government's
policy responses to the recessionary conditions of the mid1980s. While continuing its New Economic Policy goals of
poverty alleviation and income redistribution, the Government
now also emphasizes adjustment and stabilization policies
aimed at achieving sustained economic growth, fiscal
discipline, consolidation of public sector finances and a more
active role for the private sector in the national development
effort. These are to be achieved through promotion of greater
efficiency and productivity in all sectors.

The Bank will support projects which strengthen the performance of industry and agriculture and upgrade and
rehabilitate infrastructure, including social infrastructure. The
development of the private sector will also be emphasized in
projects.

In the agriculture sector, the Bank will support projects
designed to rehabilitate natural forests. In rural development,
the strategy is to improve the productivity of smallhoider
cultivators, particularly through support of multi-cropping programs and other self-help schemes to raise incomes and

Maldives

Operational Strategy: The Bank’s assistance program

“in Maldives has focused on power, transport and communica
tions to support the directly productive investments made by
the Government and the private sector. This emphasis is
expected to continue but, over the longer term, project
possibilities aimed at export development or efficient importsubstitution will also be considered.

Loans and Technical Assistance: in 1988, the Bank
provided a loan of $6.4 million from ADF for the Male’ Port
Development Project to improve the commercial harbor and
develop a new interisland harbor in Male’. This involved cofinancing of $6.1 million from the OPEC Fund and UNCDF.
A technical assistance grant of $480,000 was provided for
the institutional development of port management.

Previously, the Bank had provided three loans, all from
ADF, for the development of interisland transport ($1 million
in 1981}, a multiproject loan ($2.4 million in 1984} for five
subprojects supporting ports, communications and power infrastructure, and a power system development project ($6.1
million in 1987) to augment generation and improve distribution in Male’. In addition, the Bank had provided eight
technical assistance grants totalling $1.8 million. Three were
used to prepare. Bank loan projects and five to assist the
Government in identifying and planning priority investment
projects, to prepare subprojects under the multiproject loan,
to review interisland transport operations and to support the
institutional development of the Maldives Eleciricity Board.

Project Implementation: By the end of 1988, the
Bank had extended four loans to Maldives. Of these, one loan
had been closed and three loans were ongoing. Contract
awards in 1988 totalled $1 million, bringing cumulative contract awards to $3.5 million, or 35 per cent of the net effective
loans. Disbursements totalled $900,000, compared with $1.1
million in 1987. Cumulative disbursements amounted to $3.3
million or 32 per cent of the net effective loan amount.

The Multiproject was completed within the revised
schedule and the Power System Development Project,
approved in 1987, became effective. The project is supported

Nepal

Operational Strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy
for Nepal emphasizes improvements to agricultural productivity; containment of factors which threaten agricultural productivity and ecological balance (mainly deforestation);
enhancement of industrial development; development of
energy, using abundant water resources; and development
of supporting physical and social infrastructure. The Bank also
supports institution-building.

The Government took a number of steps to improve implementation during the year. The Program Budgeting and
Project Monitoring System, under technical assistance financed
by UNDP and executed by the Bank, was being introduced
and another technical assistance project, Improving Government Financial Accounting and Audit Procedures, was under
implementation. Two country projects review missions visited
Kathmandu to discuss implementation problems with government officials and remedial measures were agreed upon.
Disbursements, which had declined in 1986 and 1987, increased by 45 per cent in 1988, reflecting closer attention paid
to implementation by the Government and executing agencies. During the year; the Bank made a supplementary loan
to cover the cost overrun on the Tribhuvan International
Airport Project. Construction of the new international
passenger terminal complex was nearing completion.

Pakistan

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational strategy
in Pakistan is focused on balanced growth and improved equity, to be achieved through structural change, improved
economic efficiency and strengthened development institufons. The Bank’s primary commitments should remain with
agriculture, energy and industry. The further development of
social and other infrastructure also merits Bank attention as
improvements in these sectors are a precondition for sustained
long-term overall economic growth and structural change.

The major focus of Bank assistance in agriculture will continue to be on increasing the productivity and output of major
crops, with diversification and minor crops to be supported
as a secondary and long-term objective. Bank assistance in
the energy sector concentrates on a program of gradual diversification. While. maintaining an interest in the power sector,
with emphasis on mobilizing co-financing and improving
operational efficiency, the Bank will give more aitention to
helping the Government find ways to moderate energy use
and increase the supply of indigenous resources. In the industrial sector, traditional lending through the DFIs will continue but the Bank will also examine new areas and develop
modalities such as equity investment, leasing and direct lending to private industry. Bank assistance for social infrastructure will be increased from previous low levels, with an emphasis on education, primary health care and improvement
of the environment in major urban centers.

Policy Dialogue: The Bank continued agriculture sector discussions with the Government. Satisfactory progress
is being made by the Government in the phased elimination
of fertilizer subsidies and in the attainment of full recovery of
irrigation operation and maintenance expenditures. Discus-sion was also held on the industrial and financia! sectors during
the formuiation and processing of the Bank's Industria! Sector
Program loan. This loan is an integral part of an economic
adjustment program developed and being implemented by
the Government to maintain rapid, indusiry-led growth
through deregulation and improved incentives to provide
increases in employment, income and social services for a
growing population.

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1988, Bank
lending to Pakistan arnounted to $649.4 million, $319 million
from ADF and $330.4 million from OCR, for eight projects.
This compared with $541.6 million for 10 projects in 1987.

sector small-scale industries in industrial development. The
Second Farm-to-Market Roads Project will improve about
2,000 km of rural roads in 19 districts of four provinces. The
fifth power sector loan to the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, through rehabilitation and expansion of transmission lines and distribution systems, will maintain appropriate
levels of reliability and quality of electricity supply and reduce
power system losses. The Third Pirkoh Gas Development
Project will increase gas production to about 350 million cubic
feet per day in the desert-mouniains of Baluchistan. The
Industrial Sector Program loan will support industrial restructuring and strengthen administrative and _ institutional
capabilities to ensure effective implementation of the Government’s economic adjustment program. A second loan to the
privately-owned National Development Leasing Corporation
Limited (NDLC) will provide lease financing for the equipment needs of enterprises in the private sector. The Bank also
provided an additional direct equity investment of $165,000
in NDLC.

The Bank approved 19 technical assistance projects to
Pakistan, totalling $6.7 million. This compared with $4.2
million for 14 projects in 1987. Project preparatory technical
assistance amounted to $1 million for five projects, and advisory and operational technical assistance amounted to $5.7

emphasis on monitoring projects are augmented by semiannual country projects review meetings with the Bank to
address cross-sectoral implementation constraints and issues.
During the year, the Government instituted mid-year reviews
of project implementation at federal and provincial levels.

The Government requested the Bank to assist in a joint
review of its procedures and requirements to attain better implementation results. This review is expected to facilitate implementation and accelerate disbursements. Commitments
under the Third Development Financing Project, a $200
million credit to six financial intermediaries which became
effective in July, progressed well ahead of schedule, reflecting the rapid growth of private sector industry.

During the year, the Bank conducted a procurement
seminar in Pakistan which was attended by 29 officials.

Papua New Guinea

Operational Strategy: In line with the Government's
Development Plan and Public Investment Program for
1989-1993, the Bank’s operational strategy in Papua New
Guinea (PNG) is geared towards promoting growth of
smallholder agriculture, fisheries and forestry; maintaining and
expanding physical and social infrastructure which supports
productive sectors; broadening the industrial base by enhancing private investment in small and medium-size agroindustries and manufacturing; and strengthening local institutional capacity to plan, implement and monitor programs and
projects and to improve aid coordination.

Policy Dialogue: During talks between the Government and the Bank in early December, agreement was
reached on clearly defined objectives and strategy for longterm cooperation between PNG and the Bank; priority sectors, subsectors and programs in which the Bank would
assume a lead agency role in the country’s development efforts; and the levels and terms of Bank assistance, including
access fo various instruments and forms of assistance. At the
request of the Government, the Bank agreed to assume a lead
role in the sectors of agriculture and livestock, fisheries and
marine resources, road and port infrastructure, urban water
supply and sewerage and health. In addition, the Bank's role
will be complementary ‘in industrial development, urban infrastructure and housing, and development finance
institutions.

This lead role requires the Bank to provide assistance in
sectoral policy development; support institutional development
within these sectors; increase technical assistance and program
and project financing; and assist in mobilizing and coordinating
additional funds from multilateral and bilateral sources. It was
further agreed to continue policy discussions on an annual
basis.GROWING rubber and other crops at Cape Rodney, Papua
New Guinea. The Smaltholder Project, aimed at increasing
incomes for about 1,200 farm families, is supported by a concessional Bank loan of $15 million.

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1988, the Bank
made no loans to PNG after approving two loans totalling $10
million in 1987. Two loans previously in the Bank’s pipeline
for 1988, one in the agricultural support services sector and
one in the health sector, were financed at more concessional
terms by bilateral donors. A change of government in
mid-1988 caused some delays in loan processing and two
anticipated loans were deferred until 1989 on procedural and
technical grounds.

The technical assistance program to PNG totalled

to PNG totalling $282.6 million for 21 projects. Of these loans,
13 amounting to $142.3 million were from OCR and 15 totalling $140.3 million from ADF. Technical assistance totalling
about $7.4 million had been provided for 38 projects, of which
nine resulted in Bank loans amounting to $127.3 million. The
transport and communications sector accounts for about
36 per cent of total cumulative Bank lending, followed by
agriculture with 22 per cent and energy with 12 per cent.

Most projects gained momentum and remarkable‘progress was made in disbursement. But there were still implementation problems, including delays in loan:signing and loan effectiveness. Loan signings were delayed mainly becalise loans
had to be approved by Parliament before they could be signed.
Loan effectiveness was held up mainly by difficulties in fulfilling conditions for effectiveness, such as.land acquisition: and
various agreements among‘concerned ‘institutions: Delays are
also common in the recruitment of project staff and consultants
and in the submission of audited. financial statements. The
scope of some country loan-disbursemént ‘missions is being

Philippines

Operational Sirategy: The Bank's recently-completed
Country Strategy Study on the Philippines is focused on the
more immediate requirements of an economy which suffered
a serious dislocation following the crisis of 1983. Under the
strategy, the Bank will continue to support poverty alleviation and employment generation, especially in rural areas, and
a more equitable distribution of the benefits of the development process. The strategy also recognizes the need to improve balanced regional. development, given the wide
disparities in income and quality of life in different regions.

While the study identifies issues on a priority basis, it also
emphasizes three considerations for implementing the strategy.
First, more attention should be given to policy-based program
and sector lending. This recommendation is based on the
likelihood of persisting balance-of-paymenis constraints,
reduced access to commercial foreign borrowings, and the opportunities which such modalities provide for linking policy

and institutional reform with Bank assistance. Secondly, more
attention should be given to rehabilitating and improving the
existing infrastructure. Bank assistance will also be provided
for institutional support to executing agencies carrying out
operations and maintenance activities in strategic sectors such
as irrigation, power, roads, ports and water supply. Thirdly,
in response to the serious poverty situation, the Bank will provide more support to upgrade social infrastructure, including
high-priority projects in health, education, water supply and
sewerage, and urban development.

As the economy continues to recover, the strategy will
emphasize efficiency aspects of investment and will address
the need to increase capacity in the productive sectors.

 

COMPUTER class at the Manila Technician Institute in Taguig,
Philippines, under the Technical and Vocational Education
Project. Aimed at developing technical manpower to
accelerate the country’s industrialization, the project has been
assisted by a Bank loan of $27 million.Policy Dialogue: A number of important institutionai
and policy issues were discussed in 1988. Under the Forestry
Sector Program loan, the Bank discussed institutional
improvements in the forestry sector and the strengthening of
policies to curb indiscriminate exploitation of forests. Policy
dialogue was also held, under the Fourteenth Power (Sectoz)
loan, on the formulation of transfer pricing mechanisms
between the National Power Corporation and power utilities
which purchase power from it. In support of the dialogue,
a technical assistance grant was provided to assist the Office
of Energy Affairs in carrying out the study. In the Secondary
Education Development Sector Project. discussions evolved
around a policy and institutional framework io’ facilitate
implementation of the Government’s Secondary Education
Development Program.

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1988, Bank
Sending to the Philippines rose sharply to $381.96 million
($204 million from OCR and $177.96 million from ADF) for
seven projects from $43.5 million for one project in 1987.
Three projects involved co-financing. The Agricultural
Technology Education Project had co-financing of $6.5 million
from the OPEC Fund and the Forestry Sector Program was
co-financed from Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund in the amount of $120 million. The Bank also approved
a private sector loan, co-financed by the International Finance
Corporation in the amount of $24 million, to the Philippine
Long Distance Telephone Company, Inc. and an equity
investment of $2.5 million in H&Q Philippine Ventures, Inc.

The loan program covered several subsectors including
forestry, secondary and tertiary (agricultural technology)
education, power, microcredit and integrated area development (IAD). The forestry sector program involved policy and
institutional reforms and loan proceeds will provide balanceof-payments support to the Government and ensure the
availability of resources to expand and accelerate the Government’s reforestation program. The loan for agricultural
technology education will help the Government rationalize and
upgrade the agricultural education and training system and
improve its relevance to national development needs. The sector loan for secondary education development will complement the Government's strategy for upgrading physical
facilities, curricula and instructional materials; providing staff
development assistance to improve private secondary education; and improving sector management and evaluaiion. The
IAD project is aimed at reducing rural poverty in Sorsogon
Province, one of the least-developed areas, by increasing
incomes, generating employment and improving living standards for subsistence farmers and fishermen. The power loan
is for system rehabilitation and upgrading to improve supply
reliability and overall standards of service. The microcredit
project is designed to alleviate poverty through the use of nongovernmental organizations as credit intermediaries for financing micro-enterprises and cottage indusiries.

The Bank also approved 23 technical assistance projects
amounting to $11.9 million, compared with eight projects
totalling $1.8 million in 1987.

The Bank held,a country seminar on procurement, attended by 30 officials, at Bank Headquarters in December,
Separate meetings were held to discuss differences between
Government and Bank guidelines on procurement and consulting services. Contract award and disbursement performances are expected to improve as a result.

Sri Lanka

Operational Strategy: The Bank seeks to assist Sri
Lanka develop a diversified and export-oriented economy,
depending more on the private sector and able to generate
domestic and external resources required for self-sustainable
growth. The Bank is supporting the reconstruction and
rehabilitation program in the north and east with the two main
aims of generating productive employment and ensuring that
public expenditure is cost-effective.

Policy Dialogue: Discussions with the Government in
the agriculture sector were focused on the introduction of credit

financing for tree crop investment and simplification of
cess/subsidy administration which were addressed under the
Perennial Crops Development Project in 1988. Discussions
on industrial and financial policy under the Second Development Financing Project centered on improving the investment
environment for the private and export sectors through tariff,
exchange rate and interest rate reforms.

Loans and Technical Assistance: [n 1988, the Bank
approved four loans totalling $108.3 million from ADF, compared with four loans for $106,3 million in 1987. Two loans
involved co-financing from the Government of Canada and
the International Development Association totalling $44
million. Local cost financing amounted to $36.98 million, or
34 per cent, of Bank lending. The Bank loan for the Emergency Schools Restoration Project was the second for the
Government’s, reconstruction and rehabilitation program,
following a 1987 foan for emergency roads restoration. Two
other loans will provide term finance for private sector
industries through financial intermediaries and support the
training of technical manpower. The fourth loan will support
the development of perennial crops.

The Bank approved a total of nine technica! assistance
grants for $1.8 million. Two were for the preparation of a
telecommunications project and an agriculture rehabilitation
project in the north and east. Seven were advisory and operational grants. They will be used to review crop production incentives, the urban sector, Southern Province development,
and education and training. They will also provide support
for the establishment of a unit trust; institutional support for
the Capital Development and Investment Company Ltd. and
assistance for the establishment of an investors’ compensation fund and workshops for training in securities.

At the end of 1988, the Bank-had approved 52 loans
to Sri Lanka totalling $78371 million for 46 projects. Of these
loans, six amounting to .1 million were from OCR and
46 totalling $768.9 million were from ADF. Technical
assistance totalling about $11.5 million had been provided for
63 projects, of which 26 resulted in Bank loans amounting
to $485.3 million. The agriculture and agro-industry sector
accounts for about 47.7 per cent of total cumulative Bank
lending to Sri Lanka, followed by development banks

$64.8 million, compared to $48.5 million in 1987. Cumulative
disbursements of Bank loans amounted to $351 million or
47 per cent of the total amount of the net effective loans.

Implementation is proceeding reasonably well, although
problems included constrained budgetary resources and delays
in loan effectiveness and the recruitment of consultants. Bank
missions have discussed these problems with the Government
which has taken steps to reduce delays.

Thailand

Operational Strategy: Based on the Bank’s operational strategy for Thailand, Bank operations in Thailand are
aimed at achieving both sustained lending and developmen
. tal impact as a means of promoting efficient resource use,

equity and structural change. The Bank wili continue to stress

7778

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

support for the Government's Sixth National Economic and
Social Development Plan (1987-1991) through multisectoral
involvement with public investment programs in the context
of a rapidly growing and modernizing economy. The current
high growth rates have produced increasingly severe infrastruc ture constraints; accordingly, public infrastructure lending will
continue to be the main basis for Bank lending in Thailand
for the remaining period of the Sixth Plan. Given the critical
role of certain sectors in the Government's industrialization
program, Bank operations will reflect a concentration on these
areas. Support will be continued to improve the country’s
power base, with emphasis on both increased generating
capacity and improvements in distribution to ensure effective
power utilization. The transport sector has also been identified
as a key area with large resource requirements, and the Bank

  

USING (left) and repairing (right) the telephone service in northern Thailand which was provided under the Bank-assisted Rural

Telecommunications Project.

will examine opportunities to provide support for its continued
development.

While the Bank’s current operational program is centered
on assistance to relieve infrastructure constraints, the Bank
will also continue to seek involvement in other priority sectors
such as social infrastructure, particularly water supply, rural
development and small-scale industries to. the extent that
suitable opportunities arise and are endorsed by the Thai
Government for multilateral financing.

Policy Dialogue: Within the framework of specific projects, the Bank has maintained a continuing policy dialogue
in Thailand, which has been focused on strengthening the performance of state enterprises as part of the wider effort of
restructuring the Thai economy, with the objective of increas

ing the enterprises’ operational efficiency, strengthening their
Taanagement, improving their financial viability, and assisting
them in developing a more commercial orientation. Through
‘a combination of advisory technical assistance inputs and the
introduction of appropriate loan covenants, the Bank has
maintained an extensive policy dialogue aimed at improving
‘the managerial efficiency of specific state enterprises and promoting the introduction of corrective measures — tariff inreases and debt restructuring, reduction in system losses,
rganizational changes and training — which have resulted
cin substantial improvements in their operations and financial
“profile.

Loan and Technical Assistance: In 1988, the Bank
provided one loan of $64.75 million to the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) for the Sixth Power Distribution
(Sector). This project wil! supply power to about 283,000 new
consumers in the Bangkok area and will enable MEA to
expand its distribution system and to improve reliability and
‘quality of electrical supply. It involves co-financing of $21.3
million in the form of suppliers’ credit.

The Bank also approved four technical assistance grants.
Advisory and operational technical assistance was provided
‘to MEA for a study of computer-based systems and to the
Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives for a Private Tree
‘Farms Development Study. Supplementary assistance was
also supplied for a Provincial Towns Water Supply Project
and for a study of the Government Manpower Planning and
Information System.

As of the end of 1988, the Bank had approved 52 loans
totalling $1,793.1 million for 49 projects in Thailand. Of these
loans, 46 amounting to $1,721 million were from OCR.
Technical assistance totalling $12.4 million had been provided

for 53 projects, of which 10 resulted in 11 Bank loans
amounting to $344.6 million. The energy sector accounted
for 48.6 per cent of cumulative lending, followed by the
transport and communications sector with 15.7 per cent.

Project Implementation: Of the 52 loans approved
to Thailand, 34 had been closed and 18 were under
administration during 1988. One loan was closed in 1988.

Disbursemenis totalied $88.8 million, compared with $80.8 .

amounied to $1,145.2 million, or 83 per cent of the total
amount of net effective loans. Contract awards:in 1988 totalled
$51.3 million, bringing cumulative contract awards to
$1,245.8 million or 91 per cent of net effective loan amount.

Implementation in the energy, transportation, water
supply and development banks sectors was generally satisfactory, as staff of executing agencies are experienced and efficient. Problems were experienced in agriculture sector projects,
including management weakness and inadequate interagency
cooperation, but the Bank has worked closely with the
Government to remedy these problems.

Smaller South Pacific Developing Member
Countries!

Operational Strategy: Recognizing the unique characteristics of the smaller South Pacific developing member countries (SPDMCo), individually as well as a group, the Bank has
continuously adopted a flexible approach in its strategy and
operating procedures. In recent years, the Bank has focused
increasingly on supporting productive activities in agriculture
and indusiry, frequently in the form of multiproject loans
covering several smail public sector projects in key sectors as
against earlier concentration on assisting physical and social
infrastructure. in the energy sector, technical assistance is being
provided to develop the SPDMCs’ hydropower potential.
Support is also being channelled through credit lines to
national development banks to assist productive activities in
the private sector. In addition, the Bank emphasizes institutionbuilding through human resource development.

Since its establishment in 1984, the South Pacific
Regional Office (SPRO) has assumed responsibility in formulating the Bank’s operational strategies and programs for
Cook Islands, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu.
The SPRO is also responsible for preparing economic reports
for these countries. The SPRO is administering ali DF loans
for most of the smaller SPDMCs and several projects in other
sectors. In addition, the SPRO is administering a number of
World Bank co-financed loans in the smaller SPDMCs.

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1988, the Bank
approved two multiproject loans to Tonga and Western
Samoa and one power project loan to Kiribati. The three loans
amounted to $10.2 million from ADF. The loan to Kiribati
will provide an expansion of the power distribution
system in Tarawa and the provision of tools and equipment
for the Public Utilities Board workshops. The two multiproject
loans to Tonga and Western Samoa will provide for a number
of small projects, primarily infrastructural, as well as for
agriculture and agro-indusiry.. The multiproject loan to
Western Samoa involved co-financing of $700,000 from the
OPEC Fund for International Development. Cook islands,
Solomon islands, Vanuati and Western Samoa received nine
technical assistance grants totalling $1.37 million, of which
four were for project preparation and five for advisory and _
institutional strengthening purposes.

At the end of 1988, the Bank had approved 50 loans
amounting to $129 million for 47 projects in the smaller
SPDMCs. Technical assistance totalled $15 million for 94CARRYING coconuts in Western Samoa, where the Bank has supported the Coconut Oi Mill Project, the country’s first major
industrial enterprise, with a $2.25 million loan

projects, of which 20 had resulted in Bank loans amounting
fo $54.95 million. The agriculture and agro-indusiry sector
and development bank lending accounted for almost one-half
of the cumulative Bank lending to the smaller SPDMCs.

Project Implementation: Of the 50 loans (including
one Special Assistance ioan) approved for the smaller
SPDMCs, 30 had been closed and 20 were under administration at the end of 1988, including three that were awaiting
effectivity. Contract awards totalled $7.8 million in 1988,
bringing cumulative contract awards to $82.4 million or

67 per cent of the total net effective loan amount.
Disbursements totalled $10.4 million in 1988 compared to
$7.5 million in 1987. Curnulative disbursements of Bank loans
totalled $79.6 million, or 65.2 per cent of the total amount
of net effective loans.

Project impiementation problems encountered in the
smaller SPDMCs are often related to geographical remoteness,
the small size of countries, land tenure problems and
unavailability of skilled manpower. The Bank continues to
address these problems by providing technical assistance to
strengthen key institutions.

Project Administration

IN 1988, the Bank responded to the challenges of increased
lending and larger, more complex projects with a series of
innovative improvements in project administration procedures.
These improvements, which enabled the Bank to handle the
increased volume of business without loss in quality, focused
on simplifying and streamlining ‘internal procedures for project implementation as well as delegating more responsibility
to the Bank's Project Divisions and executing agencies. These
moves were accompanied by increased emphasis on improving the skills of executing agency staff through training.

A Committee on Speeding Up Project Administration,
consisting. of senior operational staff, reviewed Bank procedures for project administration and recommended improvements. A major outcome was a proposal! fo give more
decision-making authority to executing agencies by increasing
the limits for international shopping to $500,000 for procurement of goods and to $1 million for civil works and by raising
the limit for direct purchase to $50,000.1

Other improvements focused on reducing the Bank’s
direct involvement in local competitive bidding, after being
satistied that local procedures are acceptable; encouraging the
use of advance action for procurement and recruitment of consultants; expanding the use of sample bidding documents, imprest accounts and statement of expenditure procedures; and
reducing delays in making leans effective and expediting
disbursements.

The Committee noted that the existing arrangement in
Project Divisions, where one senior officer in each division
is responsible for the coordination of project administration,
should continue.

On the basis of the Committee’s recommendation, the
Central Projects Services Office (CPSO) is expected to play
a more active role in streamlining project administration procedures by delegating more authority to the Project Departments and executing agencies and putting more emphasis on
training.

 

1 The proposal was approved by the Board in February 1989.

To facilitate the recruitment of consuliants, the Committee recommended merging the Consultants Administration
Section of the Budget, Personne! and Management Systems
Department with the Consulting Services Division of CPSO.
This reorganization, which became effective on 1 August, will
simplify and speed up internal procedures for consultant
recruitment. It will also eliminate some duplication of activities.

To enhance project implementation, other measures
taken during the year included providing more information
about the consultant recruitment process and improving communication between the Bank and executing agencies on this
subject; increasing the impact of project supervision missions;
revising procedures in line with trade ‘practices for procurement of internationally traded commodities; and issuing draft
revised Project Administration Instructions on the methods
of handling proposed changes in project scope, utilization of
loan savings and extension of loan closing dates.

A Task Force, appointed by management to review the
recommendations of a report by the Post-Evaluation Office,

' recommended that the Bank adopt a two-pronged approach

to secure a greater degree of compliance with special loan
covenants. On one hand, the formulation of the covenants
couid be improved through analysis of sectoral requirements
and socioeconomic realities in developing member counties
(DMCs}. On the other hand; the monitoring of compliance
could be stepped up through systematic review and follow-up.

An important step to improve the Bank's project.monitoring capability was the beginning of work on a computerized
Project Administration System (PAS). When operational, the
systern will enable management and staff. to monitor .key
project administration indicators and take remedial action
when implementation problems develop.

The computerized Loan Financial ‘information System
(LFIS) continued to be a useful tool for monitoring and ‘con:
trolling the financial status of projects. Staff utilized the planning capabilities of the LFIS to make project-by-project
forecasts of contract awards and disbursements.. ‘Close
following-up of these projections by Bank staff.and- executing
agencies was partly responsible for the record disbursement
levels achieved in 1988.*Other efforts to improve project implementation included the preparation of ‘a Guide to. Bid

The Project Administration Committee (PAC) continued
to be the focal point for supervision of the Bank’s project portfolio, At PAC meetings, which are held monthly at departmental level and quarterly at management level, the physical
progress of projects is reviewed to identify implementation
problems and formulate remedial measures.

In addition to these internal measures, Bank staff continued to provide support to executing agencies through
regular field visits to review projects. During 1988, 320 project
administration missions were fielded covering 461 projects.
These missions utilized 4,542 man-days for an average of 9.9
man-days per project. This compares with 377 missions covering 530 project reviews-and utilizing 5,540 man-days, an
average of 10.5 man-days per project, fielded in 1987. The
Bank’s Resident Offices in Bangladesh and Indonesia and the
South Pacific Regional Office in Vanuatu continued to provide vital support to executing agencies in project administration. This was reflected by the significant increase in
disbursements in these countries. To further strengthen this
function, the Board of Directors approved in 1988 the
establishment of two new Resident Offices in Nepal and

Pakistan. When established in 1989, these new offices are
expected to assist greatly in improving project implementation and loan utilization.

Country projects review meetings. {(CPRMs}, which provide a periodic forum for Bank staff and senior DMC officials
at the national level to exchange views on implementation
constraints and cross-sectoral issues, to review problem
projects and to agree on remedial measures, visited Indonesia,
Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines and Sri Lanka during the year.

These meetings resolved conflicts between government
and Bank procedures, promoted coordination between concerned departments and ministries, enhanced project monitoring efforts, and dealt with project implementation problems.
The problems included delays in loan effectivity, consultant
recruitment and procurement; staff shortages; lack of conformity of bidding documents with Bank guidelines; and local
budgetary constrainis.

The CPRM for the Philippines, the first since 1986, reconciled major differences between the Government’s and the
Bank’s procurement and consultant recruitment procedures.
DMC officials attach considerable importance to CPRMs and
acknowledge the usefulness of these reviews in enabling them
to identify and deal with project implementation problems in
a systematic manner. In addition to the CPRMs, 11 country
loan disbursement missions, which concentrate on improving
disbursements and contract awards under specific projects,
visited executing agencies in seven borrowing countries.

Training is an important element in the Bank’s efforts to
improve project implementation. With the upward trend in
lending, coupled with increased delegation of decision-making
authority, it has become increasingly critical to upgrade continuously the project implementation capabilities of executing
agencies. Two regional seminars on project implementation
management, involving 36 officials of executing agencies and
central government departments and ministries, were held
during the year. These seminars provide project managers with
broad exposure to modern management techniques and give
participants the opportunity to exchange ideas and learn from
the experiences of project staff around the region. In addition, seminars covering the Bank’s procedures for procurement, project administration and disbursement were held in
Bangladesh, People’s Republic of China, India, Pakistan and
Philippines. These seminars trained 152 staff from executing
agencies and line ministries. In-house seminars for Bank staff
on project administration are also a regular feature of the
Bank’s training program.

Besides these, several briefings on Bank policies and procedures relating to procurement and consultancy were
arranged at the Bank’s Headquarters in Manila for visiting
DMC officials, consultants, businessmen and trade missions.
Seminars aimed at executing agencies on the usage of consultants were also held in People’s Republic of China and
indonesia. In addition, a seminar on the development of
domestic consultants was held in the Philippines.

To promote Bank activities in DMCs and publicize
business opportunities available to consultants, suppliers and
contractors, business opportunity and business information
seminars were held in Au8tralia, Austria, Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, Finland, India,
Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore and Sweden.There were 146 consulting firms and 70 individual consultants engaged by borrowers for loan-financed projects while
122 consulting firms and 161 individuals were employed by
the Bank for technical assistance projects. The total value of
contracts under Bank-financed projects awarded during the
year totalled $1,929.1 million of which $1,134.1 million was
from ordinary capital resources (OCR) and $795 million was
from the Asian Development Fund (ADF). This was 34 per
cent above the $1,440.12 million in contracts awarded in 1987
and represented a record level of performance. Cumulative
contract awards now total $12,812.4 million or 62 per cent
of the net effective loan amount.

Loan Disbursements

The positive trend of loan disbursements which started
in 1987 strengthened further in 1988. Tota! disbursements
rose to $1.65 billion, or 34.1 per cent over the previous year.

BANK staff {right) and a local project officer during a Special Project Administration Mission to Fiji in December.

OCR disbursements rose by 38.2 per cent to $957.4 million
from $692.8 million in 1987 and ADF disbursements increased by 28.4 per cent to $691.7 million from $538.6

‘million in the same period.

The trend was attributable to the fact that Indonesia introduced measures to speed up project implementation such as
decentralization of decision-making on procurement, the
Philippines established a high-level Project Facilitation Committee, Bangladesh and Pakistan made special efforts to
complete large procurements and Bangladesh, Fiji, Indonesa
and Philippines expedited the disbursement process of program loans.

For its part, the Bank strearnlined project administration
organization and procedures; promoted close monitoring and
following-up of contract awards and disbursements through
the PAC review system, the Resident Offices and a greater
use of imprest account and statement of expenditure
mechanisms; increased the number and frequency of county projects review missions and country disbursement mis

sions as well as procurement and disbursement seminars which
helped borrowers to review the status of the country portfolio
of loans and focus attention on the removal of constraints to
aid absorption.

Project Administration Indicators

As of 31 December 1988, there were 405 projects under
administration, compared with 394 projects at the end of
1987. During 1988, 60 projects were completed compared
with 52 in 1987 and 40 loans were closed compared with 53
in 1987. Of the 405 projects under administration at the end
of 1988, 35 (8.6 per cent} were identified as requiting special
attention by the Bank due to unsatisfactory performance, 39
projects (9.6 per cent) were classified as significantly delayed
(where the closing date of the loan had been extended by

MAKING test-tube racks under the Educational Equipment Development Project in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Designed to supply

more than three years). This compares with 56 projects (14.2
per cent) requiring special attention and 41 significantly
delayed loans (10.4 per cent) at the end of 1987. No new
cost overrun projects were identified in 1988, despite volatile
currency exchange rates.

During 1988, 31 Project Completion Reports (PCRs)
were prepared and circulated to the Board bringing the total
number of PCRs submitted to the Board to 308. PCRs have
been prepared for most completed projects, generally within
the stipulated six to 12 months after project completion. Considerable attention was directed during the year towards
improving and streamlining the Bank's internal system for
preparing PCRs. This was’done by delegating more responsibility to executing agencies for the initial preparation of PCRs
and improving the planning process by moving to a two-year
planning cycle to avoid submitting PCRs to the Board during
the busy fourth quarter.

 

educational equipment to schools, the project was supported by a concessional Bank loan of $6 million.Project Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation

During 1988, the Bank’s project benefit monitozing and
evaluation (PBME} program continued along previously
established lines. PBME activities include the preparation of
benchmark information about beneficiaries; the introduction
of project benefit monitoring systems to help improve the sustainability of project benefits; and the preparation of impact
evaluation studies.

The preparation of benchmark information about
beneficiaries during the preparation of a project is now a
routine feature of feasibility studies for which the preparation
is financed by the Bank. In other cases, this information is
prepared during the early stages of project implementation.
This favorable trend has been reinforced by the introduction
of more exhaustive project preparation procedures for poverty
alleviation projects. Earlier problems, which resulted in staff
not being able to locate reports containing benchmark and
other PBME information, are being resolved through the introduction of a computerized Project Administration System
which, among other things, will note the completion date and
location of the reports.

Experience has shown that relatively few projects provide a good vehicle for introducing project benefit monitoring systems which help agencies to improve their ability to
manage the delivery of services from project investments.
Projects which provide a good vehicle are sectoral projects
which have the scope to enable the loan to be used as a vehicle
to help the executing agency improve its management by introducing or upgrading existing management information
systems. Two such projects are the Irrigation Sector Project
in Nepal, which was approved in 1988, and the Water Supply
Rehabilitation Project in the Philippines which was due io be
approved in early 1989.1 A standardized model for project

benefit monitoring for integrated area development projects
was developed on the basis of a critical assessment of
experiences in the Palawan Integrated Area’ Development
Project and this approach was applied in the Sorsogon
Integrated Area Developmen Project, which was approved
in 1988. Both projects are in the Philippines.

A provisional impact evaluation study was prepared for
the Vientiane Plain Road Improvement Project in Lao PDR
and this study made it possible to include assessment of the
project’s economic benefits in the Project Completion Report.
However, this was an exceptional case and the preparation
of PBME impact evaluation studies, either when projects are
completed or several years thereafter, continues to be
problematic. According to present practice, the administrative
responsibility for preparing these studies resides with executing
agencies and the cost of preparing the studies are financed
from loan proceeds or domestic appropriations. However, this
arrangement is not very satisfactory because loan funds can
be used to pay for their preparation only while the loan
account is open and in most instances there are no significant benefits to observe until several years later. [In addition,
many reports have deficiencies in quality and content and

‘there is a need for the Bank to exercise greater supervision

and control over their preparation.

In December 1988, the Bank conducted a Regional
Seminar on Monitoring and Evaluation of Development
Projects and Trainers Workshop in association with the
Economic Development Institute of the World Bank and the
National Institute of Public Administration in Malaysia. The
seminar was attended by practitioners and resource persons
from People’s Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand. The seminar assessed the progress and
problems in the implementation of monitoring and evaluation systems, recommended additional emphasis on monitoring to enhance the sustainability of benefits from project
investments, and provided valuable insights about useful
approaches to the preparation of impact evaluation studies.as Development Project in Pakistan’s Baluchistan

A decade of post-evaluation experience provides a wealth of
insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of Bank-supported
activities and a useful guide to improving the design and conduct of Bank operations in the future. Ernploying both aggregative and differentiated analysis, the evaluation system
continues to develop in breadth and scope under the PostEvaluation Office (PEO).

The maturation of Bank operations in some sectors and
countries, qualitative improvements in Project Completion
Reports (PCRs) and the need- to improve the effectiveness
of resources applied to the Bank’s post-evaluation system led
to the introduction in 1988 of a selective system of project
performance auditing, with the approval of the Audit
Committee.

Selective auditing does not t jeopardize the integrity of the
Bank’s post-evaluation system as the selection criteria ensure
that PCRs for projects excluded from auditing adequately fulfill
the accountability and lesson-learning functions of postevaluation.

During 1988, 43 projects were evaluated. Of these, 31
were covered by 30 Project Performance Audit Reports
(PPARs) and subjected to in-depth assessment of their
economic, financial, institutional and social achievements and
impact. For the other 12 projects, PEO staff reviewed the
PCRs to ensure they met approved exclusion criteria.

By the end of the year, 268 PPARs covering 283 projects
had been prepared. Post-evaluation of completed projects
covers 19 countries and all rnajor sectors. The proportion of
completed projects post-evaluated rose to 64 per cent, compared with 63 per cent in 1987.

The year’s evaluated projects covered 13 countries and
15 subsectors. All but one of the 43 projects were approved
between 1976 and 1984, with 74 per cent approved between
1978 and 1981. About 77 per cent were completed during
1986-1987 with the remaining 23 per cent finished between
1983 and 1985.

In terms of country grouping, the projects are distributed
more evenly than in previous years, Seventy per cent of the
projects are distributed equally between Group B {lowermiddle-income) and Group C (upper-middle-income) countries, with the remaining 30 per cent in Group A (low-income)
countries. Sectorally, 58 per cent of the projects reviewed were

in the industry and energy sectors, including deveiopmert
banks. Agriculture accounted for 16 per cent and infrastructure 21 per cent, followed by multisector with five per cent.

Thirty-three projects, or 77 per cent, were considered
successful, compared with the long-run average success rate
of 67 per cent. Seven projects, or 16 per cent, were assessed
as partially successful while three, or seven per cent, were
rated unsuccessful.

The high proportion of projects in the industry and energy
sector had a favorable impact on the overall rate of success.
The performance of infrastructure projects was also markedly
better than in the previous two years.

Among country groups, project performance reflected
the stage of development of the countries. Group B and
Group C countries scored an 80 per cent success rate, followed by Group A countries with 69 per cent. Group C countries did not experience failures and the unsuccessful projects
were distributed between Group A and Group B countries,
with Group A having the larger share with 15 per cent. in
Group B countries, the share of partially successful projects
was 13 per cent, slightly below the partial success rate for
Group A countries, while unsuccessful projects accounted for
seven per cent.

Improved project preparation and design, largely a reflection of experience gained over the years, was a major factor
influencing performance. The improvements also reflected the
substantial technical assistance and institution-building components financed by the Bank. About 60 per cent of the
projects evaluated this year represented additional operations
in the same sectors and/or were implemented by the same
executing agencies. Similarly, about 60 per cent of the projects
were prepared and designed on the basis of feasibility studies
financed by the Bank, other multilateral agencies and bor
rowers. Major factors that adversely affected project outcome
were inadequate design, relatively weak institutional infrastruc.
ture and an uncertain policy environment.

In addition to the PPARs and selective evaluation of
PCRs, PEO completed two impact evaluation studies and
three special studies during the year. The impact evaluation
studies examined in depth agricultural credit subsector operations in Nepal and electric power subsector operations in
Thailand. The three special studies reviewed and consolidated

89the major findings of post-evaluation studies undertaken by
the Bank and the World Bank in Indonesia, Malaysia and
Thailand.

The Impact Evaluation Study of Bank Operations in
Nepal found that Bank assistance helped to promote new
technologies for agricultural and rural development, to develop
the rural financial sector and to facilitate distribution of institutional credit widely in the rural areas. The study made recommendations to improve farmer training to obtain optimum
results from the transfer of technology, to assess local sociocultural values and behavioral patterns before lending, to
examine more closely the policy environment under which
an agricultural development finance institution operates and
to ensure that technical assistance and training programs meet
local needs.

The Impact Evaluation Study of Bank Operations in the
Power Subsector of Thailand underscored the significant
impact of Bank assistance on the electric power subsector.

It concluded that the major factors which contributed to the
success of Bank operations were flexible government policies,
careful project preparation, strong and mature executing agencies and the adoption of proven technology suited to local
conditions. The study also concluded that the record of
achievement justifies using sector lending as the principal
means for assisting Thailand's power subsector.

The three special studies will help facilitate the feedback
of the lessons learned from the Bank’s experience in Indonesia,
Malaysia and Thailand.

The Tenth Review of Post-Evaluation Reports was
circulated to the Board of Directors in April and the Seventh
Report of Selected Post-Evaluation Findings was circulated
to the Board in March. PEO’s computerized Post-Evaluation
Information System was further improved and the system can
be accessed by the Bank’s operational departments.

The Bank management and the Audit Committee of the
Board continue to monitor post-evaluation activities to ensure
the effectiveness of the post-evaluation system and the feed
back of the lessons learned. The Audit Committee reviewed
selected PCRs and PPARs during the year, as well as the
PEO’s Tenth Annual Review of Post-Evaluation Reports. The

AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Financial Policies

IN accordance with the income policies approved by the Board .

in 1987, the Bank ensures that its long-term interest coverage
ratio (}CR} does not fall substantially below 1.25 and its longterm reserves to outstanding loans ratio (RLR) is within a range
of 20 to 25 per cent. As of 31 December 1988, the ICK stood
at 1.68 and the RLR at 34 per cent. The reductions in the
Bank's loan charges approved by the Board in 1987 went into
full effect on 1 January 1988 and resulted in significant cost
savings to borrowing member countries.

The capital stock is defined in the Bank’s Articles of
Agreement in terms of United States dollars of the weight and
fineness in effect on 31 January 1966. Since the coming into
effect of the Second Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on 1 April
1978, currencies no longer have par values in terms of gold.
Pending the Bank’s seleciion of the appropriate successor to

“the 1966 dollar, the value of the Bank’s capital stock has been
expressed in terms of the SDR on the basis that each share
has the value of SDR10,000. The mutual obligations of each
member and the Bank with respect to maintenance of value
of currency holdings have also been measured by the same
standard, but settlement of such obligations has been held in
abeyance. For purposes of the financial statements, the SDR
has been translated into current United States dollars at the
rate computed by the IMF. As of 31 December 1988, the rate
was $1.3457 per SDR. Further information on the Bank’s current practice regarding valuation of capital and maintenance
of value is given in Notes A and F of the Notes to Financial
Statements of Ordinary Capital Resources, OCR-7.

Two working papers on valuation of the Bank’s capital
and maintenance of value were considered by the Board in
1988. During Board discussions, a proposal to denominate
the Bank's capital in terms of the current SDR was considered.
A third working paper focusing on maintenance of value was
submitted to the Board in September for consideration in-due
course.

Variable Lending Rate

The Bank’s pool-based variable lending rate, introduced
on 1 July 1986, applies to all ordinary operations loans approved after 30 dune 1986 and to nearly all ordinary
operations loans approved between 24 September 1985-and
30 June 1986. The lending rate, adjusted on 1 January and
1 July each year, is determined by adding a spread (currently
0.4 per cent per annum) to the average cost of a’pool of
outstanding Bank borrowings. From its initial level of
7.65 per cent per annum set on 1 July 1986, the lending rate
has progressively declined. The rate was reduced on 1 January
1988 to 6.59 from 7.03 per cent per annum, reflecting the

relatively low cost of borrowings in 1987 and the reduction
of the variable spread to 0.4 from 0.5 per cent per annum,
effective 1 January 1988. The rate was further reduced on
1 July 1988 to 6.53 per cent per annum!

The variable lending rate does not apply to loans approved
under the old lending rate system where the rates were fixed
at the time of loan approval for the entire life of the loan. As
of 31 December 1988, the variable lending rate applied to
$561 million of disbursed and outstanding loans and to $3,337
million of undisbursed loans, representing about 10 per cent
and 65 per cent of the respective totals.

Borrowings

The Bank's borrowings in 1988 amounted in total to $435
million. Details are given in the table on page 184.

In a midyear review of the Bank’s liquidity situation and
borrowing program, it was indicated that on the basis of revised
estimates of the various factors affecting liquidity, the level
of liquidity at year-end was likely to remain high. Accordingly, it was decided to reduce the year’s borrowing program to
only three or four “market presence” issues, with the result
that some of the borrowings envisaged in the original program
were not undertaken.

Consequently, the Bank undertook only three borrowings during the year — in Switzerland, United States and
Japan. The first borrowing, in February, was a two-tranche
public bond issue in Switzerland totalling SwF150 million.
Tranche A, amounting to SwF100 million, had a seven-year
maturity and Tranche B, amounting to SwF50 million, had
a 20-year maturity. The borrowing in the United States, in
May, was a public offering amounting to $100 million, the
proceeds of which were swapped into Swiss francs under a
related currency liability swap transaction. The final borrowing for 1988, undertaken in Japan, in September, was a ¥30
billion public issue in the form of Daimyo bonds, which combine characteristics of Euroyen and Samurai bonds. The bonds
are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

The average original life of the year’s borrowings,
weighted by amount, was 9.65 years compared with the
average original life in 1987 of 10.93 years. At the end of
1988, the remaining average life of the Bank’s outstanding
borrowings, weighted by the amount of each borrowing, was
7.74 years.

The 1988 liability management program. consisted of calls
on seven high-coupon issues which were either refinanced
with new borrowings or redeemed, the latter helping to reduce
liquidity. The total amount prepaid was $610 million. Consequently, the Bank’s 1988 borrowing and liability management programs had the net effect of reducing liquidity by $175
rnillion.

Capitalization

In February 1988, the United States paid the fifth instalment, as well as the outstanding balance of the third instal-_
ment, of its subscription to the. third general capital increase
{GCI lll}. As a result, the United States’ GCI Ill subscription and its voting power, which’ had been reduced in February
1986 in view of the shortfall in.the third instalment payment,
were fully restored. This brought the number of shares subscribed to GCI Ill since it became effective in April 1983 to
742,872, representitig 98.8 per cent of the total share entitlements of all member countries.

In September ‘1988, the Board of Governors adopted
Resolutions Ne. 193, 194 and 195 authorizing special in- |
creases in the capital-subscriptions of Japan, Sweden and
United States, to take-effect in accordance with the provisionsSAN 3

Bank’s capital stock to be made available for these special
increases. This brought the Bank’s authorized capital stock as
of 31 December 1988 to $22.641.7 million (SDR16,825.2
million). The subscribed capital stock stood at $21,644.9
million (SDR16.084.5 million).

Future Resource Requirements

In May 1986, the Board of Governors adopted Resolution No. 179 requesting the Board of Directors to undertake
a study of the Bank’s future resource requirements for financing its ordinary operations. The study will eventually lead to

the formulation of specific proposals for a further general
capital increase (GCI IV). A report providing an updated
review of progress on the study was approved by the Board
of Directors in March 1988 for submission to the Board of
Governors. The report was considered by the Board of Governors at the Twenty-First Annual Meeting. In accordance with
the program envisaged in the report, three papers on valuation of capita! and maintenance of value were submitted to
the Board during 1988, and the External Panel's report on
the roie of the Bank in the 1990s was received in January
1989. A further report of the Board of Directors on the
progress of the study has been submitted to the Board of
Governors for consideration at the Twenty-Second Annual
Meeting, and various maiters related to GCI IV will be considered by the Board of Directors during 1989

Replenishment of ADF and TASF (ADF V)

THE current replenishment of the Asian Development Fund
(ADF) and the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) was
authorized by Governors’ Resolution No. 182 in October
1986. The replenishment, known as ADF V, is intended to
finance the Bank's concessional lending program over the fouryear period 1987-1990, while $72 million is for allocation to
the TASF for technica! assistance to poorer developing
meimber countries (DMCs) and for regional technical
assistance. At the exchange rates specified in the Resolution,
the total amount authorized was $3.6 billion.

During 1988, the Bank received ADF V Instruments of
Contribution from Australia, Austria, Italy, Netherlands, .
Norway and United States. With only one contribution still
outstanding, toial contributions to the replenishment at the
end of the year amounted to $3,574 million (at the exchange
rates specified in the Resolution). The contributions of Canada
and the United States are qualified, whereby, as permitted
by the Resolution, all instalment payments except the first are
subject to subsequent budgetary appropriations. Under the
ADF V “trigger” arrangements, the availability for operational
commitments of the second, third and fourth tranches of the
unqualified contributions is subject to the availability of the
first, second and remaining two tranches of the qualified contributions. The arrangements for ADF V envisaged that the
second tranches of the unqualified contributions would be

Availability and Utilization of ADF Resources

At the beginning of 1988, the net resources available for
ADF loan commitments, after allowing for a provision for exchange rate fluctuations, amounted to about $1,053 million.
Contributed ADF resources becoming available during the year
fat the exchange rates as of 31 December 1988) consisted
of $169 million under the United States’ qualified ADF IV and

previously released in full, $170 million for the first tranches
of the unqualified ADF V contributions received during the
year from Australia, Austria, Italy, Netherlands and Norway,
and $737 million for the 73.59 per cent portion of the ADF V
second tranches released in December. Net income for the
year added a further $47 million to resources. On the other

rates applicable at the time of loan negotiation. After taking
account of repayments, cancellations and exchange rate adjustments, cumulative net loan commitments increased to
$9,267 million at 31 December 1988. leaving a balance of
uncommitted resources at that date of $2,265 million. After
allowing for a provision of about $634 million for exchange

At the end of 1988, the Bank's investments of ADF

to the equivalent of $607 million ($676 million at the end of
1987). Of the total investments, 18 per cent (21 per cent at
the end of 1987) was held in securities issued or guaranteed
by member governments. The balance was invested in
deposits and other bank instruments in member countries. The
realized rate of return on ADF investments over the year was
7.86 per cent, compared with 7.67 per cent in 1987.

Technical Assistance Special Fund

Resolution No. 182 authorizing the ADF and TASF
replenishment (ADF V) provides, among other things. that
an aggregate amount equivalent to $72 million (at the exchange rates specified in the Resolution} be set aside from
the first instalment payments of all contributions to the
replenishment in proportion to the total amount of each contribution and allocated to the TASF for technical assistance
to poorer DMCs and for regional technical assistance.

The total amount allocated to the TASF from the six
ADF V contributions committed to the Bank during 1988 was
$26.5 million ($23.6 million at the exchange rates specified
in the Resolution). By the end of 1988, the cumulative amount
allocated to the TASF from ADF V contributions committed
to the Bank as of that date was $91 million. Of this amount,
$23.7 million had been utilized.

During the year, Pakistan made a further direct voluntary contribution of $58,000 to the TASF. The contribution
may be used to finance the costs of services and facilities from
Pakistan and other DMCs. As of 31 December 1988, total
direct voluntary contributions to the TASF amounted to the
equivalent of $83.8 million, of which $82.7 million had been
utilized.

Japan Special Fund

At the Twentieth Annuat Meeting of the Bank in Osaka,
dapan, in 1987, the Government of Japan expressed interest
in entering into a financial arrangement with the Bank through
the establishment of a Special Fund designed to contribute
to the accelerated economic growth of the Bank’s DMCs.
Subsequently, the Japanese Government and the Bank
entered into a financial arrangement following the authorization by the Board on 10 March 1988, formally establishing
the Japan Special Fund (JSF}.

The objective of the JSF is to help DMCs restructure their ©

economies in the light of the changing global environment and
broaden the scope of opportunities for new investment,
thereby assisting the recycling of funds to DMCs. Within this
objective, the JSF will support the efforts of DMCs toward
industrialization, natural resources development, human
resources development and technology transfer, and will be
utilized: (i) to finance or co-finance, on a grant basis, technical
assistance projects, whether in the public or private sector,
including project preparation, advisory services and regional
activities; (ii) to finance or co-finance private sector development projects through equity investments; and {ii) to finance
or co-finance, in special cases and on a grant basis, technical
assistance components of public sector development projects
financed under loans from the Bank.

Under the financial arrangement, the Government of
dapan made available to the Bank, as administrator, the first
instalment amounting to ¥2.5 billion for the Government's
fiscal year 1987 (April 1987-March 1988). The amount was
received by the Bank on 25 March 1988. The second instalment amounting to ¥2 billion, for the fiscal year 1988, was
received on 21 April 1988. It is expected that the Government will contribute to the JSF for the fiscal years 1989 and
1990, subject to budgetary approval-by the Diet of Japan.

As of 31 December 1988, the total contribution of ¥4.5
billion was equivalent to $35.8 million. Of this amount,
$520,000 had been disbursed during the year for technical
assistance operations. In accordance with the JSF financial
arrangement, undisbursed funds are invested by the Bank,
and total income earned from such investments during 1988
amounted to $1.18 million.

Vice-Presidents

THE Board of Directors, acting on the recommendation of
the President, appointed Mr. In Yong Chung as Vice-President
(Finance and Administration) for a five-year term effective
from 1 August 1988,

Mr. Chung was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

Economic Planning for the Republic of Korea from May 1987 ©

to February 1988. Before that, he was Minister of Finance.

Mr. S. Stanley Katz, the previous Vice-President (Finance
and Administration), became Vice-President (Operations),
also from 1 August. Mr. Katz succeeded Mr. M. Narasimham,
who resigned from the Bank.

Staff

The Bank's staff at the end of 1988 totalled 1,642 from
39 of the 47 member countries: 605 professional staff and
1,037 supporting staff. During the year, there were 49 professional staff appointments and 41 terminations of appointment. Among supporting staff, 79 were appointed and 50
resigned. ‘

Five young professionals joined the Bank in 1988. They
will replace the 1987 intake who will progress to regular professional staff positions during 1989. Five young professionals
are proposed to be recruited in 1989. 
During 1988, the Bank prepared a Job Rotation Scheme
which is designed to enhance career development by providing
high-potential staff with exposure.to different areas of the
Bank. Actual implementation and staff movements under the
scheme will take place in early 1989..

Based on developments in the compensation. levels and
practices of the Bank’s comparator organizations, and also on
cost-of-living considerations, salaries of professional and supporting staff were reviewed and adjusted upwards ‘in 1988.
Professional staff salaries were increased by 5.2 per cent, while
salaries for supporting staft were raised by 12 per.cent. A onetime payment of 1.52 per cent of gross salary was also granted
to supporting staff on account of the differential due to delayed

salary actions by certain comparators in the 1987 general
salary review. Dependency allowances of supporting staff were
also increased.

The Staff Retirement Plan was improved by increasing
the pension accrual rate to 2.9 per cent from 2.75 per cent
of the highest average remuneration for each year of service;
increasing the lump sum withdrawal benefit by 10 per cent;
changing the formula allowing for pensions to be converted
from the participant’s currency of remuneration to the participant’s home country currency so that it is determined by
the average exchange rate over the preceding 60 months; improving the early retirement benefit for staff required to leave
service in the interests of the good administration of the Bank
or because of redundancy, for a fixed period until
31 December 1989; and improving the pension for existing
pensioners and other beneficiaries by increasing the accrual
rate to 2.75 per cent from 2.5 per cent.

The Housing Loan Program for supporting staff was
reviewed after the program's first year of operation. Loan applications were approved during the first year totalling P46.6
million. Certain changes were approved by the Board with
effect from 11 October 1988: shortening the length-of-service
requirement; adjusting the three-tier maximum loanable
amount in line with average salary increases; and increasing
the maximum loan ceiling to reflect increases in housing costs.

During 1988, performance evaluation of staff was further
oriented towards recognizing work excellence, meritorious
contribution to the Bank’s output and potential for career
development and advancement, while at the same time also
enabling the identification of performance weaknesses for corrective action through counselling and training, where possible. The performance evaluation process is being geared to
bring out more critically the cases of underperforming staff
whether due to individual shortcomings or skills mismatch and
changing skills requirements. More intensive efforts were made
‘to-realize the early separation of staff in the interest of the good
administration of the Bank. These efforts were directed at the
replacement-of-such staff by more effective persons, or persons whose skills are more suited to the changing work
demands. For those eligible for early retirement pension, an
additional measure to facilitate such separation was effected
through the non-reduction of pension where the separation

103104

is made in the Bank's interest. The grievance procedure introduced in May 1987 was reviewed in the light of the first year's
experience during which two appeals involving separation
from service were heard by the Appeals Committee. The
review of the operations of the grievance procedure was made
by the Appeals Committee which took into account the views
of the Budget, Personnel and Management Systems Department and the Staff Council. Certain improvements were
recommended, most of which have been implemented. The
suggestion that an Ombudsman be established will be considered in 1989.

Organization

in duly, the Bank approved the establishment of new
Bank Resident Offices in Kathmandu, Nepal, and Islamabad,
Pakistan, to be implemented in the second half of 1989.

Functions relating to the engagement of consultants for
technical assistance projects and for supplementing the Bank's
staff were reorganized in August. These functions in the Central Projects Services Office and the Budget, Personnel and
Management Systems Department were reorganized to
eliminate overlapping responsibilities and to improve decisionmaking in the processing of consultant engagements.

Recognizing the Bank's increasing role in the environmental field, it was decided to upgrade the Environment Unit,
attached to the Infrastructure Department, to a Division during
the first half of 1989. It was also decided to merge the CoFinancing Unit and the Coordination Center into the CoFinancing and Coordination Unit, and to place the latter under
the direct supervision of the Vice-President (Operations), with
effect from 1 January 1989. This organizational change was
prompted by the Co-Financing Unit's increased activities in
such fields as guarantee operations, complementary financing and collaboration with other agencies, particularly nongovernmental organizations, and the need for better coordination and monitoring of the Bank’s technical assistance program, especially with the introduction of the dapan Special
Fund.

The internal Task Force Study of the Bank’s Operational
Staffing Requirements in the 1990s was completed in early
1988. The STAFFPLAN Model developed by the Task Force
was presented to the Board in April and duly, An interface
between the STAFFPLAN Model and the budgetary process
is under development. Further refinement of the Model for
use as a tool in allocating staff resources against work programs will be undertaken.

The new Headquarters building project has been delayed.
The new building is targeted to be completed and occupied
during the last quarter of 1989.

Internal Audit

The Internal Audit Office (AQ) reviews the adequacy
and effectiveness of controls, systems and procedures relating
to financial, accounting, administrative, data processing and
project administration matters. It provides an independent and
objective evaluation and identifies means of improving efficiency and economy of activities and use of resources. [AO
reports to the President, but its activities are also reviewed
by the Audit Committee of the Board.

IAO’s system-based reviews and spot checks resulted in
findings and recommendations which in 1988 led to significant improvements, while participation in the development
of computer systems enhanced internal controls. Under the
integrated assistance to the Bank's external auditors, [AO provided them, among others, with reviews of updated internal
control questionnaires and selected current transactions,thereby facilitating more efficient coordination and cost- saving
Tneasures.

In its review of IAO’s program and activities and implementation of audit recommendations by concerned departments, the Audit Committee of the Board expressed
satisfaction.

Computer and Office Automation Program

During 1988, the Office of Computer Services (OCS)
accelerated activities, expanded staff and upgraded
technologies to meet the growing volume of Bank operations.
All central data processing became fully operational on the
IBM 3090 computer and MVS/XA operating system. A tria!
was begun of the CON-NECT Universal Office System, which
provides electronic mail services to over 275 staff. A trial data
communications link was established between Bank Headquarters and the South Pacific Regional Office which gives
staff in Vanuatu direct on-line access to the Bank’s mainframe
computer. Data communications capabilities were aiso
enhanced by the implementation of the SWIFT ST400 interbank transfer system which runs on two Digital Equipment

Corporation MicroVax I} computers.

The microcomputer population of the Bank was
expanded io almost 900 units located in all departments. Its
usage was enhanced through the Bank-wide conversion to
the WordPerfect-5 word processing and the MS/DOS 4.00
operating system software. Almost half the Bank staff was

trained in the use of WordPerfect-S and Bank departments 
are using the Ventura desktop publishing systern to produce
some publications more efficiently. The usage of microcomputers was expanded for mission purposes through the acquisition of 55 Zenith 183 and 40 Zenith Supersport 286 laptop computers to complement the older Compaq and Data
General-One portable computers to enable staff to speed up
completion of mission activities and reports.

Staff proficiency in microcomputer usage improved considerably in 1988 following the establishment of a formal Computer Training Facility which provided basic and advanced
courses in word processing, spreadsheet analysis, statistical
analysis, desktop publishing and other software systems
throughout the year

New mainframe computer-based Payroll and Computer
Asset Management Systems were completed and a
microcornputer-based standard Project Cost Table System was

development of new project administration, private sector
operations and property management systems was started.
This was accompanied by the reorganization of OCS and the
provision of extensive internal and external training to all OCS
staff to enable them to continue to support the Bank’s future
activities.

Budget

Internal Administrative Expenses for 1988 amounted to
$96.842 million against the original Budget of $98,446
million, representing a utilization rate of 98 per cent. The
under-utilization of $1.604 million is due mainly to savings
arising from lower-than-budgeted expenses for the Board of
Directors, staff benefits, staff, relocation and other administrative expenses, but partly offset by higher-thanbudgeted expenses for the annual meeting, staff salaries, consultants, business travel and representation.

A budget of $109,405 million, summarized in Appendix 1, is provided for Internal Administrative Expenses in
1989. This represents an increase of $12.563 million, or 13
per cent, over actual expenses in 1988. The increase is for:
(i) the full-year effect of improvements in salaries and benefits;
ti) additional staff, consultant services, business travel and
other overhead expenses in support of the Bank’s operations;
{iii} provisions for new Resident Offices to be established in
Nepal and Pakistan and for higher expenses related to occupancy of the new Headquarters building; (iv) provisions for
prospective price escalation; and (v) provision for general
contingency.

Commitments for Services to Member Countries in 1988
amounted to $30 million, representing 100 per cent utilization of the original Budget and an increase of 16 per cent over
actual commitmenis in 1987. The Bank’s Technical Assistance
Program will fully incorporate technical assistance grants
financed from Bank funds and from other sources of funds.
This eliminates the need fo continue with the Services to
Member Countries budget which previously presented
separate allocations for Bank-funded technical assistance
grants.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

applicable rates of exchange at the.end of:a reporting perfod. Revenue

and expense amounts are translated fot each semi-monthly period ,

generally at the applicable rates.of exchange at the beginning of each
period; such practice approximates the application of average rates
in:effect during the period. Translation adjustments relating to confributions are ‘offset ‘by inéreases or decreases in the contribution
accounts. Translation adjustments telating to set-aside resources (see
‘Note E) are recorded as receivable from or payable to Ordinary Capital
Resources. ‘Other translation adjustments are charged or credited to
“Accumulated translation adjustments”. Exchange gains or losses on
currency transactions among functional currencies are included in

The annualized rate of return on the average investments held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the beginning and end
of each quarter, including realized gains and losses, was 7.86%

NOTE D — ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND
ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

~~ Administrative expenses include an administration charge amounting
to $45,729,000 ($45,597 ,000—1987}. The charge represents an © *-~
* apportionment of all administrative expenses of the Bank (other than’,
those appertaining directly to ordinary operations and special opera”
tions) based on the number of loans and equity investments approv- ._ ed for the year. :

-- Pursuant to'the provisions of Article 19° paragraph i {i} of the Articles".
‘. of Agreement: Establishing ‘the Bank,-the Board of Governors has *:.”
‘authorized the setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired “paid-in” capital”:

paid by members: pursuant to ‘Article 6; paragraph .2.(a) and of the =:
: convertible currency portion paid. by members pursuant to: Article 6

 

 

 

 
 

 

paragraph 2 (b) as of 28 April 1973, to be used as a part of the Special
Funds of the Bank. The capital so set aside was allocated and transferred from the Ordinary Capital Resources to the Fund as Set-Aside
Resources.

The capital stock of the Bank is defined in Article 4, paragraph 1 “in
terms of United States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on
31 January 1966” (the 1966 dollar}. Therefore, Set-Aside Resources
had historically been translated into the current United States dollar

of gold. From 1973 until 31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on this
basis was $1.20635 per 1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at which
time the Second Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the

; International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect, currencies no

longer have par values. in terms of gold. Pending the Bank's sélection of the appropriate successor to the 1966 dollar, the: Set-Aside
Resources has been valued for purposes of the accompanying finan
‘clal statements in terms of.the Special Drawing Right {SDR}, at the

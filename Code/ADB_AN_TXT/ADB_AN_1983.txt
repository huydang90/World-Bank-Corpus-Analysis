_The Asian Development Bank

The Asian Development Bank, an international partnership of 45 member nations, is
engaged in promoting the economic and social progress of its developing member countries
in the Asia-Pacific region.

The Bank started functioning in December 1966 with its Headquarters in Manila, Philippines. It is owned by the governments of 31 countries from the Asia-Pacific region and 14
countries from Europe and North America. ‘

In 17 years of operations, the Bank. has become a major catalyst in promoting the
development of the most populous and fastest growing region in the world today. The Bank’s
principal functions are (i) to make loans for the economic and social advancement of developing member countries; {ii} to provide technical assistance for the preparation and execution of
development projects and programs and advisory services; (iii} to promote investment of
public and private capital for development purposes; and {iv) to respond to requests for
assistance in coordinating development policies and plans of member couniries. In its operatlons, the Bank is also required to give special attention to the needs of the smaller or less
developed countries and give priority to regional, sub-regional and national projects and programs which will contribute to the harmonious economic growth of the region as a whole.

The financial resources of the Bank consist of ordinary capital resources, comprising
subscribed capital, reserves and funds raised through borrowings; and Special Funds, comprising contributions made by member countries and amounts previously set aside from the
paid-in capital. Loans from ordinary capital resources, which account for almost 70 per cent of
Bank lending, are generally made to member countries which have attained a somewhat
higher level of economic development. Loans from Special Funds, which are administered in
the Asian Development Fund, are made almost exclusively to the poorest borrowing countries
on highly concessional terms.

The Bank has borrowed funds for its ordinary operations from the capital markets of
Europe, Japan, the Middie East and the United States. lt has aiso sold two-year doliardenominated bonds to central banks or monetary authorities of its members. The Bank’s
callable capital which at the end of 1983 accounted for nearly 86 per cent of its subscribed
capital backs its borrowings in the capital markets.

The Bank’s operations cover the entire spectrum of economic development, with particular emphasis on agriculture, energy and social infrastructure. Most Bank financing is
designed to support specific projects. In certain cases, the Bank also provides program, sector and multiproject joans.!

With the growing need for larger and more diversified inflows of capital to the region, the
Bank is actively expanding its co-financing activities, with official as well as commercial and
export credit sources. The Bank has also recently entered into equity investment operations.

The Bank's highest policy-making body is its Board of Governors which meets annually.
The direction of the Bank’s general operations is the responsibility of the Board of Directors —
composed of 12 Directors (each with an Alternate) — eight representing regional countries
and four representing non-regional countries. The Board of Governors conducts an election
for the Board of Directors every two years.

The President of the Bank is elected by the Board of Governors for a term of five years,
after which he may be re-elected. The President is Chairman of the Board of Directors and
under its direction he conducts the business of the Bank. In this he is assisted by the VicePresidents, who are appointed by the Board of Directors on ihe recommendation of the
President.

The Bank has 20 departments and offices — including a Resident Office in Dhaka,
Bangladesh — dealing with various operational, financial, administrative and general support
functions.ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

THE BANK IN 1983

DURING the year, the Bank substantially improved its
resource position and increased the volume and scone of
its lending and technical assistance activities. In addition,
itt undertook equity investment operations for the first time.
The Sank also focused attention on consolidation and further strengthening of iis organizational capabilities.

The third Asian Development Fund replenishment (ADF Vj,
covering the period 1983-86, and the third General Capital
increase (GCI II!), covering the period 1983-87, both came into
effect during 1983.

Bank lending and equity investments amounted to $1,896
million compared with $1,731 million in 1982, an increase of
9.6 per cent in nominal terms compared with a 3.2 per cent
rise in nominal terms in the previous year: Over the five-year
period 1979-83, the annual increase in nominal terms
averaged 11 per cent.

The pace and momentum of growth, however, remained
uneven in some of the Bank’s developing member countries
(DMCs) as they continued to grapple with the problems of
tesource constraints and made economic adjustments
necessitated by the effects of the worldwide recession. Consequently, several projects already substantially processed
for potential Bank financing had to be temporarily set aside.

Technical assistance activities recorded a substantial increase of about 40 per cent, with the amount involved rising
from $18 million in 1982 to $25 million in 1983.

Total annual disbursements increased by 17.8 per cent
from $795 million in 1982 to $937 million in 1983. The average
size of loans rose frorn $30.4 million in 1982 to $34.4 million
in 1983.

Other highlights of 1983:

* Four Special Assistance loans were approved to speed
up completion of ongoing Bank-financed projects held back
by shortages of local funds.

* Complementary financing, a mechanism for promoting
commercial co-financing, was undertaken for the first time.

* In October, a comprehensive review of the Bank's financial policies was undertaken, taking account of the report

on financial policies submitted in April by Dr. Irving S.
Friedman, an international financial expert.

* Borrowings in international capital markets rose from
$882 million in 1982 to $978 million.

¢ A third Vice-President was appointed in April.

* The Bank hosted an International Symposium on
Development Strategies in Asia and held its first Development Round Table.

* The first two issues of the Asian Development Review:
Studies of Asian and Pacific Economic tssues were published.

APPROVALS

1979 1980 1981 1982 1983LENDING ACTIVITIES: During the year, the Bank
approved 65 loans totalling $1,893 million for 53 projects in
17 DMCs compared with 57 loans totalling $1,731 million for
56 projects in 13 DMCs in 1982. Loans from ordinary capital
resources (OCR) amounted to $1,189.8 million, an increase
of 0.4 per cent in nominal terms over the corresponding figure
of $1,184.5 million in 1982, while loans from Special Funds
(SF), amounting to $703.4 million, showed an increase of 28.8
per cent In nominal terms over the 1982 concessional lending figure of $546.1 million. In 1983, about 96 per cent of SF
loans went to the low-income DMCs with a per capita gross
national product {GNP) In 1981 of jess than $350.

The total cost of prolects approved — excluding five
development finance institutlon (DFI} loans, three program
foans, four sector loans and four Speclal Assistance loans
— is estimated at $2,488 million. Direct Bank flnancing accounted for about 52 per cent of the total project costs. Of
the rest, co-financlers provided about 8 per cent, while the
balance was provided by the DMCs themseives,

It is estimated that the total cost of the subloan projects
to be financed by the five DF! loans! will be about $1,141
million. The projects to be financed by the three program
loans, four sector loans and four Special Assistance loans
will involve an estimated total cost of $1,005 million.

During the year, 18 projects involved co-financing, with
$308 million contributed by co-financiers and $769 million
by the Bank. This compared with 25 projects co-financed in
1982 for which co-financiers provided $699 million and the
Bank $878 million. The decrease In co-flnancing was attributable to the absence of large-sized projects for which
co-financing could be arranged as In previous years. It also
reflected slugglsh economic activity and resource constraints in DMCs which affected Investment programs,
especially In the industrial and energy sectors, The share of
official sources in the total amount of co-financing dropped
from 81 per cent In 1982 to 42 per cent In 1983. Co-financing

commerclal sources to all co-financing, however, rose from
37 per cenit in 1982 fo 58 per cent in 1983.

EQUITY INVESTMENTS: Following the Bank’s decision
In March to undertake equity Investment operations, two
equity investments — one each in Republic of Korea and
Pakistan — were approved during 1983. These were particlpation to the extent of Won 750 million ($0.96 million
equivaient) in the share capital of the Korea Development
Investment Corporation and extension of a line of equity of
$2 milillon to Bankers Equity Ltd. in Pakistan.

LENDING BY SECTOR: !n 1983, as In recent years, the
Agriculture and Agro-Industry, Energy and Social Infrastructure sectors dominated Bank lending, together accounting
for over 80 per cent of the total. This reflects the high priority
which continues to be given to these sectors both by ihe
DMCs and the Bank. Eisewhere, there was a notable increase in lending for Industry and Non-Fuel Minerals, while
lending to the Transport and Communications sector was
lower than in 1982.

Agriculture and Agro-Industry: Bank lending to this sector reflects the pivota! role that agriculture plays in the social
and economic development of DMCs.

During the year, over 34 per cent of all Bank loans and more
than 50 per cent of its technical assistance were directed
to agricultural and agro-industrial projects. These were principally aimed at increasing food production and the overall
productivity of the sector. In addition to the 15 project loans
approved in this sector, the Bank also extended three program and two sector loans. Four Special Assistance loans
were approved to provide, as a special supplementary
measure, additiona} foreign exchange financing of focal currency expenditures to those ongoing Sank-financed projects
in which impiementation is delayed or would be impeded dueto a shortage of local currency resources.

Bank lending to this sector in 1983 amounted to $648
million in 24 loans compared with $621 million in 22 loans
in 1982.

Energy: The Energy sector remained the second largest
in Bank lending operations, although its share of the total
fell from 29.7 per cent in 1982 to 23.8 per cent in 1983.

In 1983, the Bank approved eight loans for power projects
designed to help improve the quality and reliability of power
supplies and operational efficiency. In addition, the Bank
continued to assist in the extension of electrification networks in the rural areas of its DMCs and a major survey of
this work was completed.

An important energy planning project, funded jointly by
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the
Bank, commenced in Bangladesh in August. Energy planning support was also provided to Thailand by way of followup work to the Energy Master Plan which received earlier
technical assistance from UNDP and the Bank.

Bank lending to the sector in 1983 amounted to $451

Social Infrastructure: Bank lending for social infrastrueture projects — water supply and sanitation (sewerage), urban development, housing, education and health and population facilities — rose sharply in 1983 to over 22 per cent of
total lending from about 10 per cent in 1982, thereby regaining its 1981 level (21.7 per cent). In terms of three-year
averages, Bank lending continued to rise steeply from $216
million in 1978-80 to $320.2 million in 1981-83, reflecting the
importance attached to these types of projects by the DMCs
and the Bank.

In recent years, the Bank has increasingly supported projecis which involve water Supply systems in small provincial
towns and rural areas. These are designed to extend ihe
benefits of development to the rural poor and thus promote
social equity.

Loans approved in 1983 will help bring such facilities to
aless developed region of Malaysia, to 21 small communities
in the Republic of Korea and to 56 target zones in six districts

In the Urban Development sector, the Bank’s approach has
been to support programs which are intended to improve
directly the living environment of low-income households and
promote more efficient urban growth. In 1983, the Bank approved a sector foan for the Small Towns Urban Development
Project In indonesia which is designed to improve the living
conditlons of residents in 38 small and medium-sized towns
in Central Java Province.

Bank activities in the Education sector cover, among
others, vocational and technica! education, agricultural
education, community schools and science education. The
need for education to mest each country’s manpower and
development needs is emphasized, and Bank projects Invariably Include hardware components such as bulldings and
equipment as weil as software components such as teacher
training, curriculum development, staff development and the
provision of academic consultants and Institutional improvements, In 1983, the Bank approved a Second Vocational
Educatlon Project in Malaysia and an Agricultural Education
Project fn Indonesia.

In the Health and Population sector, the Bank approved
two toans in 1983, both in line with its integrated approach
to health improvement and population programs in its DMCs.

In Burma, the capability of the Rangoon Generai Hospital
to provide modern medical care will be upgraded. in
Bangladesh, the Health and Family Planning Services Proj
ect will help improve national health and reduce the population growth rate through better delivery of health care and
family planning services.

During 1983, Bank lending for Social Infrastructure projects
rose to $421.4 million from $173.5 million in 1982. Of the 1983
total, loans for Water Supply and Sanitation projects
amounted to $186.6 million ($57.9 million in 1982), Urban
Development to $36.7 million ($30.2 million In 1982}, Education to $126 million ($64.1 million in 4982} and Heajth and
Population to $72.1 million ($21.3 million in 1982).

Industry and Nort-Fuel Minerals: Through fis activities in
this sector, the Bank supports programs and projects aimed
at helping DMCs develop Industrial capacity and infrastructure. It provides finance for the creation or expansion of industrial capacity by direct tending for large-scale industries
and by indirect lending through development finance institutions (DFis) for smali and medium-scale industries. It also
extends financial and technical assistance for the establishment, expansion and upgrading of industrial research and
management training institutes and promotes the development of industrial estates.

In addition, the Bank supports minera! resources development in DMCs which have significant amounts of untapped
mineral reserves. In 1983, the Bank focused on the development and upgrading of national institutional capabilities and
facilities for conducting mineral resource surveys and ex

direct project loans amounting to $95 million in this sector
compared with one loan for $16.2 million in 1982.

Development Banks: DFIs remain the Bank’s main channel of funds to small and medium-scale industries whose
projects are too small to warrant direct Bank support. Bank
credit lines also enable DFIs to strengthen their own
managerial and technical capabilities, helping them become
more efficient and effective development institutions. In
several instances the Bank has helped establish new DFls,
especially in the South Pacific region.

During 1983, the Bank approved five loans amounting to
$206 million compared with seven loans amounting to $148.5
million in 1982. One was a composite credit line of $110
million for contemporaneous utilization by three DFls in
Pakistan, the proceeds of which wili be mainly lent to industrial enterprises in the private sector.

Transport and Communications: The Bank's DMCs need
reliable low-cost transportation infrastructure and services. In 1983, the Bank approved four loans for the
upgrading or rehabilitation of roads. Three of the recipient
DMCs — Burma, Lao PDR and Nepal — are among the
stnailer, lower-income group of couniries, and the average
size of loans to this sector dropped sharply from $42.8 million
in 1982 to $16.4 million in 1983.

The total amount of lending for Transport and Communications also decreased markedly, from $257.4 million in six
loans in 1982 to $65.5 million in four loans in 1983.

DISBURSEMENTS AND LOAN ADMINISTRATION: Loan
disbursements from OCR and SF showed an increase of 17.8
per cent from $795.1 million in 1982 to $936.9 million in
1983. Disbursements under OCR loans amounted to $715.4
million compared with $619.6 million in 1982, while
disbursements under SF loans amounted to $221.5 million
{$175.5 million in 1982). At the end of 1983. cumulative
disbursements were $4,157.6 million from OCR and $1,283.9
million from SF.

The increase in disbursements in 1983 was primarily due
to a sustained effort by the Bank and its borrowers in expediting project implementation and the implementation of
the Special Assistance program and other measures such
as the institution of an Imprest Account system to provide
advances to executing agencies and the simplification of
documentation requirements.

A total of 398 loans were under administration in
1983. Twenty-nine projects were completed.

During the year, 383 loan administration missions were
undertaken, consisting of 259 full review missions, 23 projectinception missions, 59 special loan administration missions and 42 project completion missions. In addition, 21
country disbursement missions were dispatched to explain
disbursement practices and procedures, review the status
of awarded contracts and help expedite the preparation and
submission of withdrawal applications so that loan funds
could be released in accordance with disbursement projections. There were also five country project implementation
review missions.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: The Bank provided technical
assistance, including technical assistance for regional activities, for 107 projects in 1983 compared with 80 projects
in 1982, while the total amount increased from $18 million
in 1982 to $25.3 million in 1983. Of this, $19.6 million was

On a sectoral basis, 50.2 per cent of the total amount of
technicai assistance approved in 1983 was for Agriculture
and Agro-Industry compared with 51.8 per cent in
1982. About 18.2 per cent was provided to the Energy sector, and the rest to Development Banks, Transport and Communisations, Industry and Non-Fuei Minerals and Social
Infrastructure,

REGIONALACTIVITIES: During the year, the Bank completed a Study of the Bank's Role in South Pacific DMCs in the
1980s, It also heid an International Symposium on Development Strategies in Asia, the first ADB Development Round
Tabte on Financial Policies and External Debt Management
and a Regional Workshop/Conference on Project Benefit
Monitoring and Evaluation (PBME). Other regional activities
included Studies of Food Demand and Supply and Related
Strategles for DMCs; ASEAN Coal Development; and Capitai
Markets in Selected DMCs; a Review of Energy Demand
Management Strategies in DMCs; a Regional Symposium on
Bank Assistance to DFis; the preparation of an Asian Electric Power Utilities Data Book; and assistance for the newly
established Iniernatlonal Irrigation Management Institute as
weil as the International Rice Research institute
Demonstration-Cum-Training Center on Rice Production,
Post-Harvest Technology and Biomass Utilization. The Bank
also supported a number of other research and training programs and seminars.

POST-EVALUATION: During 1983, the activities and procedures of the Post-Evaluation Office (PEO) were endorsed
by the Board. The two-tier evaluation system, covering ail
ihe Bank’s completed loan projects, was further refined.
Guidelines for preparation of Project Completion Reports
(PCRs) were revised and introduced for the first time for
Project Performance Audit Reports (PPARs). During the year,

24 PPARs were prepared, bringing the cumulative total to 105
as of 31 December 1983.

POLICY REVIEWS: During 1983, the Board of Directors
considered a wide range of important operational and financia! poficies. Of particular significance was the completion
of a detailed review of the Bank’s future resource requirements for ordinary operations, and submission to the
Board of Governors for approvai of a Report and draft Resolution regarding the Bank’s third General Capitat Increase.

The other policy issues considered by the Board in 1983
included Review of Arrangements for Lending from the Asian
Development Fund; Review of the Bank’s Role in Agriculture
and Rural Development; Review of Program Lending Policies;
Review of Bank’s Policy on Lending Foreign Exchange for
Local Currency Expenditures on Projects; Review of Bank's
Policy on Financing of Interest and Other Charges During
Construction; Special Assistance to Selected Bank-Financed
Projects; Review of Supplementary Financing of Cost Overruns of Bank-Financed Projects; Equity Investment Operations by the Bank; Streamlining of Loan Administration; PostEvaluation Office: Activities and Procedures; Currency
Swaps for Possible Borrowings with Currency Hedged Transactlons; Review of Borrowing Program for 1983; Review of
ihe Lending Rate; and Review of the Technical Assistance
Speciai Fund. The Board also undertook a comprehensive
review of the Bank's flnanclal policies takIng account of the
report submitted by an international financial expert.

LENDING RATE: The Bank's lending rate on ordinary
loans was reduced from 11 per cent per annum to 10.5
per cent per annum effective 1 July 1883 and remained
unchanged for the rest of the year.

ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES: Including the additional shares authorized for GCI Ill, the Bank’s authorized
capital stock as of 31 December 1983 amounted to $15,461.4
million (SDR14,768.1 million). During the year, subscriptions
to GCI Ilf were made by ten member countries (Australia,
Canada, Cook islands, Denmark, India, Republic of Korea,
New Zealand, Philippines, United Kingdom and United States)
for a total amount of $4,043.4 million (SDR3,833.4 miilian).’
As of 31 December 1983, the Bank's subscribed capital stock
stood at $11,510.0 million (SDRt0,993.8 million).

During 1983, the Bank made 15 borrowings amounting to
the equivalent of $979.4 million compared with a total of
$881.8 million raised in 1982. In order to enable the Bank to
increase its access to low-cost currencies, the Board of Directors in March authorized the Bank to underfake borrowings
involving currency fiability swap transactions.

The Bank made its first public offering in the Eurodoilar
market, and entered the Austrian capital market for the first
time since 1971. In April, the Bank again entered the United
States capital market, with a public offering of $100
million. The Bank borrowed a total of ¥60 billion in the
Japanese capital market, with three public bond issues, the
third being the 200th public bond issue by a foreign borrower
in Japan. The Bank raised a total of DM600 million in the
German capital market and again made two public bond
issues in the Swiss capital market where interest rates were
comparativety low. In the Dutch domestic capital market, the
Bank made a direct borrowing of {100 million from institu
 

1 Since the beginning of 1984, GCi Il subscriptions have also been received
from France ang Indonesia,tional investors and a public offering for {150 million. In
March, Two-Year US dollar bonds totalling $65 million were
placed with central banks and monetary authorities in 28
member countries. The average maturity of the year’s borrowings weighted by amount was 9.84 years, which had the
effect of increasing the average life of outstanding borrowings from 7.41 years at the end of 1982 to 7.72 years at the
end of 1983.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND: The third Asian Development Fund replenishment {ADF IV), which will finance the
Bank's concessional lending program over the four-year
period 1983-86, was authorized by Governors’ Resolution
No. 154 in July 1982. The total amount authorized was $3,214
million.! ADF \V became effective in April 1983 when the
total amount of unqualified contribution commitments
received by the Bank from developed member countries surpassed the necessary $1,600 million’ required for effectiveness pursuant to the Resolution. At the end of 1983, ADF
IV contribution commitments had been received from 18
member countries? for a total amount of $2,972 million.?

At the beginning of 1983, total resources under administration in ADF amounted to $3,617 million. New resources
received during the year included the first tranches of ADF
l¥ contributions, payments totalling $12.6 million made by
the United States under ADF II and jil and an amount of $18
million accrued to ADF by way of net income. Total ADF
resources, net of changes in value in terms of the United
States dollar, increased over the year by $590 million to $4,207
million. After allowing a provision of $215 million for exchange rate fluctuations, net resources stood at $3,992
million. Loan commitments during the year, net of
repayments, cancellations and exchange rate adjustments,
amounted to $644 million, bringing cumulative net loan commitments as of 31 December 1983 to $4,048 million. As a
result, pending release of the second tranches of unqualified
ADF IV contributions on 1 January 1984, the provision for exchange rate fluctuations was used for loan commitments to
the extent of $56 million.

OUTLOOK: Despite encouraging signs of a global
economic recovery and generally higher growth rates than
in 4982, the Bank’s DMCs continue to be hampered by
resource consirainis and a wide variety of economic ills. To
overcome these problems and the effects of the prolonged
worldwide recession, the DMCs have been adopting new
economic strategies as well as making difficult structural
adjustments.

In this connection, the Study of Operational Priorities and
Plans of the Bank for the 1980s, completed in 1982, has provided the Bank with a frarnework for addressing a wide range
of issues. These include the expansion of local-cost finaneing, program lending, supplementary financing of cost overruns, expansion of technical assistance operations,
streamlining of loan administration, equity investment cperations, increased co-financing, closer cooperation with the
non-government sector and adoption of measures to assist
the private sector.

In addition, the Bank in 1983 reassessed its role in
agriculture and rural development and reorganized its
Agriculture and Rural Development Department. The Bank
also initiated a review of its operations in the South Pacific
and at year’s end was considering a proposal to establish
a regional office there."

The inauguration of equity operations in 1983 has
stimulated a number of project proposals, which promise increased opportunities for equity investments in 1984. Similarly, the project pipeline holds prospects of increased cofinancing activities in 1984.

The appointment of a third Vice-President in 1983
increased the senior-management capacity of the Bank and
enabled a redistribution of responsibilities at that level. This
arrangement will allow top management in 1984 to provide
more effective supervision, especially of the operational
departments, and to devote increased attention to policy,
research and operational reviews and planning.
Simultaneously, a number of steps covering various phases
of the project cycle have been taken to speed up loan and
technical assistance processing and streamline operational
activities, including loan administration. Arrangements which
have been made for delegation of authority over wide operational areas are expected to result in improved workflow and
efficiency in the coming years.

Policy dialogues between senior Bank and DMC.

 

It was decided in early 1984 to establish a regional office in Vanuatu.MECHANICS repairing a iow-lift pump in Bangladesh.
The Low-Lift Pump Maintenance Program, for which the
Bank approved its first program loan in 1978, was designed
to provide pumps, spare parts and the maintenance
necessary for sustained irrigation during the dry season,

government officials will continue to be given emphasis in
1984. These dialogues are based on extensive research and
analysis on the part of the Bank, and they benefit both the
Bank and DMCs by bringing about a greater awareness of
critical issues and helping to find ways to solve them. Emphasis will continue to be placed on the monitoring of various
operational policies and on the organization of seminars and
workshops with DMC officials and Bank staff in order to ensure that these policies are properly implemented.

Following the encouraging response to the International
Symposium on Development Strategies in Asia and the first
Development Round Table on Financial Policies and Externai Debt Management of the Bank’s DMCs, both held in
Manila in 1983, the Bank proposes to hold an International
Symposium on “European Enterprise and the Asian
Challenge” on the eve of its Seventeenth Annual Meeting in
Amsterdam. Similarly, the Bank will also hold Its second
Development Round Table on Industrial Development and
Trade Policies in 1984.

The Bank has undertaken a study on ways of improving
domestic resource mobilization through financial developmeni in selected DMCs. The study will examine the present
structure of the financial sectors in these DMCs and identify appropriate strategies for financial development. As a
follow-up to this study, the Bank will conduct in 1984 another
study in selected DMGs, which wil!, among others, identify
possible areas for Bank assistance in capital market development, Both studies are expected to provide a guide for future
Bank operations in the relevant fields. The Bank will also cosponsor with the Asian Pacific Bankers Club a seminar on
Financial Market Development, to be held in February 1984.

During 1984, the Bank will continue to focus its research
on the economic conditions and concerns of the DMCs as
well as on factors affecting country programming and policy
dialogues. Basle country studies in selected DMCs as well
as secioral studies, particularly in agriculture and energy,
are also planned.

The report submitted by an international financial expert
in April 1983 generally reaffirmed the soundness of the
Bank's present financial policies while recommending the
introduction of some modifications consistent with the
ADB’s maturity and high credit standing in the worid’s financlal markets.

Looking ahead, the coming into effect of the third Asian
Development Fund replenishment (ADF IV), which covers the
period 1983-86, and the third General Capital Increase (GCI
It}, covering the period 1983-87, have determined the resource
base against which lending operations can be planned.
Based on these two major accomplishments, the Bank over
this time-frame intends to double the total lending it has
achieved over the past 15 years. As described earlier, this
prospect of increased lending has provided the Bank with
an opportunity to analyze the needs and priorities of its DMCs
and to gear iis development assistance programs to both
country-specific and regional goals.*

ysECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

PART I: THE REGION

THE BANK’s developing member countries (OMCs) generally
registered a higher rate of economic growth in 1983 than in
1982. Agriculture, aided by favorable weather, fared better
in most of the region. The gradual recovery in the industrial
countries stimulated increases in exports of both commodities and manufactured goods from the region. In addition, DMCs initiated several domestic policy adjustments to
overcome the adverse impact of the prolonged worldwide
recession. All these factors contributed to a 5.6 per cent increase in the combined gross domestic product (GDP) of
DMCs. Moreover, the aggregate trade deficit of the region
decreased and average inflation rate remained low, well
below the levels in developing countries in other regions.

International Setting

Economic recovery, initiated in late 1982 by the revival in
growth of the United States economy, gathered momentum
during 1983. Inflation rates in the world economy were subdued by the major industrial countries’ continued pursuit of
conservative monetary policies and relative stability in the
prices of food and energy. The decline in inflation, particularfy that of the United States, exerted downward pressure on
nominal interest rates, although real interest rates in the international capital markets continued to be high. World
cereal output declined in 1983, entirely due to lower production in the developed countries. The supply of foodgrains,
however, remained satisfactory because of production gains
in many food-importing developing countries and large cereal
stocks in exporting countries.

Aggregate 1983 gross national product (GNP) of industrial
countries is estimated to have grown by 1.6 per cent com:
Pared with a 0.5 per cent decrease in 1982. The average rate
of inflation in 1983 declined to 4.8 per cent compared with
5.9 per cent in 1982. The combined current account
registered a surplus of $16 billion compared with a deficit
Of $3.6 billion.

DIVERSION DAM in Mindanao, southern Philippines, where

tn 1983, the oil-exporting countries experienced a 0.6 per
cent dectine in GNP compared with a 4.8 per cent decrease
in the previous year. Because of adequate world supplies
of oil, prices remained soft, even with recovery in the world
economy. The average inflation rate in oil-exporting countries was 9.9 per cent, about the same as in 1982; the
aggregate current account deficit widened sharply, from $2.2
billion in 1982 to $27 billion in 1983. *

In 1983, non-oil developing countries recorded GNP growth
of 2.3 per cent compared with 1.7 per cent in 1982, A marked
contraction occurred in the aggregate current account deficit,
which in 1983 fell to $67.8 billion from $86.8 billion in 1982.
Inflation in 1983 was high, averaging 61.8 per cent, much
higher than the 39.6 per cent average of 1982.

Ajthough there was an improvement in GNP growth in the
non-oil developing countries in 1983 over the preceding year,
their short-term prospects remain uncertain. The upturn in
industrialized countries — which are the major markets for
the developing countries — remains tenuous. Only the continued economic growth of the industrialized economies can
sustain an expansion of commodity and manufactured exports from the developing countries. and thus their foreign
exchange earnings, needed to lighten their burden of existing
debt and to enhance their capacity for attracting net capital
inflows. At the same time, the continued pursuit of appropriate adjustment policies and austerity measures at national level are essential for improving the growth performance of individual non-oil developing countries.

Economic Developments in DMCs

During 1983, the Bank’s DMCs generally recovered from
the exceptionally low growth rates of 1982. However, the
average 5.6 per cent GDP growth rate of 15 DMCs! in 1983,
although higher than the 3.3 per cent average registered in
1982 during the depths of the world recession, was below
the average growth rate of about 6.3 per cent recorded by

-the region during the past decade.

GDP Growth

Of the DMGs listed in Table 1,'a majority experienced increases In GDP growth rates. Increases were particularly pronounced in the cases of the newly industrializing countries
{NICs}? and India, but growth rates declined in Burma, Fiji,
Nepal, Philippines and Sri Lanka.

Taking advantage of export opportunities presented by the
revival of economic activities in industrial countries, the NICs
recorded substantially higher GDP growth rates in 1983 than
in 1982. While to a large extent export-led, this growth aiso
contained elements of buoyant domestlc demand, GDP
growth In the Republic of Korea during 1983 Improved to 8.7
per cent from a 1982 growth rate of 5.8 percent. This ts attributable to a revivalin manufacturing production, which increased by 15.5 per cent. The Republic of China tn 1983
recorded 7 per cent GDP growth, up from 3.4 per cent growth
in 1982. Hong Kong's 1983 GDP grew by 5.9 per cent compared with a 1982 GDP growth rate of 1.1 per
cent. Singapore’s 1983 growth rate of 7.9 per cent was higher
than the 6.3 per cent achieved in 1982.

Four Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, Malaysia,
PhilippInes and Thaijand) had varying rates of GDP
growth. Because of high debt burdens and only modest improvements in their exports, most of them pursued stringent
fiscal and monetary policies. Malaysia curbed the expansionary public expenditure policy it pursued during 1982, and

Indonesia and Philippines, particularly the latter, grappled
with continuing external payments difficulties. Malaysia's
1983 GDP growth rate of 5.6 per cent was little changed from
the 1982 rate, Thailand benefitted from a strong private sector and recorded 5.8 per cent GDP growth during 1983 compared with 4.1 per cent in 1982, although export earnings
declined and government expenditure grew slowly.
indonesia’s GDP growth remained depressed at about 2.9 per
cent, but was higher than the 2.2 per cent In 1982. The GDP
growth rate of the Philippines declined sharply to 1 per cent
in 1983 from the already depressed 3 per cent level of 1982.

The economic performance of six South Asian countries
(Bangladesh, Burma, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka)
was mixed. Pakistan sustained a high level of economic
growth, with GDP increasing by 5.8 per cent during Fiscal
Year (FY) 1983. India experienced robust recovery in its GDP
growth — from 2 pez cent in FY 1983 to 6.5 per cent in FY
1984 — due fo production increases on a wide front, particularly in agriculture. Bangladesh made a significant
tecovery from the less than one per cent GDP growth of FY
1982, although 1983 growth of 3.3 per cent still remained
somewhat depressed. Burma’s FY 1984 GDP growth rate
declined to 5.5 per cent from 6.0 per cent in FY 1983, as
agricultural production was affected by adverse
weather. Nepal’s GDP declined by 0.9 per cent during 1983
dus to a severe drought, reversing the respectable growth
trends of the preceding two years. Sri Lanka experienced
a deterioratlon in GDP growth from 5.1 per cent In 1982 to
4.7 per cent in 1983,

Two South Pacific DMCs (Fiji and Papua New Guinea) have
experienced stagnant or negative growth in GDP since
1980. The global recession and low prices for primary commodities have been the main contributory factors. However,
in 1983, Papua New Guinea reported some improvements In
Its economic situation, while Fifl reported a 6.8 per cent
decline in GDP due to the severe Impact of cyclones and
drought. ,

Sectoral Performance

Agricultural growth in 1983 was satisfactory in a majority
of DMCs for which data are available. Generally favorable
weather and. some improvement in the prices of major export commodities promoted growth in agriculture. However,
a few DMCs (Fiji, Nepal and Philippines) experienced
declines in agricultural production in 1983 due to unfavorable
weather.

Total DMC output of major foodgrains’ — rice, wheat and
maize — rose from 277 mitlion tons in 1982 to 303 million
tons in 1983, which exceeded the record output of 284 million
tons achieved in 1981 (see Tables 2 and 3).

Rice production in DMCs increased from 205 million tons
in 1982 to 222 mitsion tons in 1983. The increase was accounted for almost entirely by production gains made in
India. Bangladesh, Repubile of Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan,
Srl Lanka, Thailand and Socialist Republic of Viet Nam also
had significant increases, but output declined in Burma,
Indonesia and Philippines.

Wheat output rose from 53.3 million tons in 1982 to 59.9
million tons in 1983, or by 6.6 million tons; two significant
DMC producers — India and Pakistan — shared most of the
gains. Maize production in DMCs increased from 19.1 miilion

tons in 1982 to 20.7 million tons in 1983 largely due to production increases in india and Thailand.

The performance of non-cereal agricultural crops in 1983
was mixed. Output of natural rubber grew by 2.7 per cent,
with Indonesia and Thailand accounting for most of the increase. Coconut output decreased by 4.5 per cent with all
the major producers among DMCs (India, Indonesia,
Philippines and Sri Lanka} experiencing significant
declines. Sugar production fell by 6.6 per cent, although production in indonesia increased substantially. Fiji, India,
Pakistan, Philippines and Thailand accounted for most of the
decline in sugar production. Palm oil production declined
by 6.1 per cent. All the minor producers among DMCs
(Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and
Thailand) increased production; however, that was more than
offset by the decline in Malaysia, the largest producer of palm
Oil. Output of cotton, jute and tea, mainly produced in South
Asia, increased by 3.6 per cent, 3.2 per cent and 5.9 per cent,
respectively.

Growth rates of the manufacturing sectors of DMCs were
generally satisfactory in 1983, The revival of demand in
developed countries stimulated growth in Republic of China,
Hong Kong and Republic of Korea. The manufacturing exports of these countries registered a substantial increase in
1983 compared with a slight decline in 1982. In Southeast
Asia, indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand enjoyed significant
Increases in manufacturing output due to both improved
domestic demand and some growth in exports. In South
Asia, manufacturing production in Burma, India and Pakistan
was boosted mainly by improvements in agricultural produc

tion which enlarged both domestic demand for industrial
products and the availability of inputs for agro-based
industries.

Data on electricity production in DMCs during 1983 is incomplete. A preliminary estimate would suggest that electricity production increased by 9.7 per cent during the year
compared with an increase of 5.7 per cent during 1982.

Oil production in the region increased from the depressed
1982 level of 101.9 million tons to 118 million tons in 1983
(see Table 4). DMCs reporting large increases in oil production are Indonesia (by 10.4 miltion tons), india (by 4.1 million
tons) and Malaysia (by 2.1 million tons).

in recent years, natural gas production has been a dynamic
component of the Energy sector of many DMCs. Most of the
nine DMCs producing significant amounts of natural gas
reported an expansion in production, with the largest increases registered by Burma, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and
Thailand.

Preliminary data indicate that there was a decline in the
total value of oil imports, from $41.1 billion in 1982 to $38.6
billion in 1983; lower petroleum prices and a reduction in the
volume of imports contributed to the decline. Large savings
in oi] import costs were reported by India ($1.2 billion),
Singapore ($765 million), Republic of Korea ($553 million) and
Hong Kong ($358 million}. The 1983 ratio of the total value
of oil imports to the total export earnings of the region stood
at 24.7 per cent, much below the 1982 ratio of 27.8 per cent. A
reduction in the aggregate oil bill and growth in export
receipts contributed to this decline in the burden of oil
imports.

Price Trends

The 1983 weighted average Increase in consumer prices
in DMCs — 7.8 per cent — was jower than the 8.0 per cent
in 1982 (see Table 5). Inflation rates declined in a majority
of DMCs, Republic of China, Republic of Korea, Malaysia,
Singapore, Thaijand and Vanuatu showed the lowest rates
of inflation, with price increases ranging between 1 and 4
per cent. The stable prices of foodgrains and oit, combined
with domestic stabilization policies tenaciously maintained
by DMCs, hetped control inflation. tnflation rates increased
significantly or remained at relativély high levels in
Aighanistan, Hong Kong, India, indonesia, Nepal, Papua New
Guinea, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Western Samoa. Depreciations of their currencies in relation to the US dollar were an
important factor in the large price increases experienced by
these DMCs.

External Sector Developments

The combined trade deficit of DMCs fell from $21.4 billion
in 1982 to $48.1 billion in 1983 {see Table 6); the decline was
mainly attributable to lower.deficits in Bangladesh, Hong
Kong, India, Republic of Korea and Singapore. Malaysia's
sizeable deficit of 1982 was succeeded by a modest
surplus. The largest increase in trade deficit was registered
by Thailand ($1.8 billion), The trade surplus of Republic of
China increased while that of indonesia declined.

!n 1983, export prices of major primary commodities increased. The largest increases were registered by copra {53.2
per cent), maize (23.9 per cent) and rubber (23.3 per
cent). Significant price increases were also recorded by cotton (15,9 per cent), tea (14.5 per cent}, copper (8.7 per cent)

and paim oil (8.7 per cent). However, compared with ihe
average prices during the period 1978-81, export prices for
ail these commodities, except cotton, maize and tea,
remained depressed during 1983.

The aggregate value of exports from DMCs increased by
5.4 per cent, from $148 billion in 1982 to $156 billion in 1983.
The increase was mainly accounted for by Republic of China,
Hong Kong, India, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan and
Singapore as exports from these countries increased
significantly over 1982 levets. On the other hand, several
DMCs, Including Indonesia, Nepal, Philippines and Thailand,
experienced declines In exports.

The total imports of DMCs increased from $1689 billion in
1982 to $174 billion in 1983, or by 3 per cent. There were
notable increases in imports in Republic of China, Hong
Kong, Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. A few DMCs
recorded lower imports in 1983 than in 1982 due to stringent
foreign exchange budgets.

The terms of trade of DMCs during 1983 generally remained
at around the levels of the previous year. Some improvements
in export unit value indices were generally offset by corresponding increases in import unit value indices. Export and
import unit vaiue indices available for nine DMCs show that
the terms of trade improved significantly for Malaysia,
Philippines and Thailand.

Data on the direction of trade flows for 1982 — the latest
year for which figures are available — show that Japan and
United States remained the region’s two largest trading partners, absorbing 18.9 per cent and 19.7 per cent, respectively, of the total exports of DMCs and accounting for 20 per
cent and 14.6 per cent of total imports. However, DMCs' trade

with oit-exporting countries (other than Indonesia) increased
significanily in 1982, accounting for 12.4 per cent of the total
imports of DMCs and 6.2 per cent of total exports. More
significantly, trade among DMCs increased. The share of
intra-DMC exports in total exports increased from 18.3 per
cent in 1972 to 21 per cent in 1982, and the share of intraOMC imports in total imports increased from 12.8 per cent
to 17.8 per cent.

The international reserves of DMGs increased during 1983
to a total of $51.1 billion at the end of the year compared
with $45.5 billion at the end of 1982 (see Table 7). A number
of countries registered increases in reserves — Bangladesh,
Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan,
Papua New Guinea and Singapore — but several countries
— Afghanistan, Burma, Republic of Korea, Nepal,
Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand — suffered a decline in
reserves. At the end of 1983, the level of reserves for the
DMCs as a whole was equivalent to 4.1 months’ imports compared with 3.8 months’ imports in 1982.

Domestic Savings, Investment and Resource Gap

Data for 1980-1982 relating to domestic savings, investment and resource gap for 14 DMCs (see Table 8) show that
gross capital formation (GCF) as a percentage of GDP averaged more than 25 per cent in ten DMCs, between 15 and
25 per cent in three and less than 15 per cent in one. However,
the ratio of gross domestic savings (GDS) to GDP was conSiderably less than the investment/GDP ratio in most DMCs,
reflecting substantial dependence on external resources.
GDS averaged more than 25 per cent of GDP in three DMCs,
between 15 and 25 per cent in six and was less than 15 per

cent in five. The resource gap — the difference between GCF
and GDS as a ratio of GDP —- averaged more than 10 per cent
in three DMCs, between 5 and 10 per cent in eight and less
than 5 per cent in three.

In 1982, the ratio of resource gap to GDP declined in severat
OMCs. Of the 13 DMCs for which data are available, seven
showed declines. in most cases, however, the declines in the
resource gap were due to declines in the investment ratio
rather than to improvements in the domestic savings ratio.
Declines in 1982 investment/GDP ratios in several DMCs
highlighted the fact that inadequate investible resources
were placing increased constraints on growth prospects.
Although 1983 data are not yet available, there are indications that the resource gaps of DMCs may have narrowed
further because of declines in the ratio of investment to GDP
or, in some cases, because of improvements in domestic
savings performance.

The net flow of external resources to DMCs declined from
$19.6 billion in 1981 to $16.9 billion in 1982, the latest year
for which data are available (see Table 9). This decline is attributable to reduction in both non-concessional and concessional flows. Non-concessional flows declined from $11.8
billion in 1981 to $9.9 billion in 1982, while concessional flows
declined from $7.8 billion to $7.0 billion.

Reflecting the continued inflow of external resources, total
DMC external public debt outstanding is estimated to have
increased from $93.7 billion in 1981 to $107.3 billion in 1982,"

 

i Data on aggregate debts of DMCs are not generally published. Fairiy adequale information on public debt ‘s, however, available for tne period up to

or by 14.5 per cent (see Table 10). Corresponding debi-service
payments increased from $10.8 billion in 1984 to $12.3 billion
in 1982. There were wide differences in the debt-service ratios
of individual DMCs, ranging from 0.2 per cent in the case of
Hong Kong to 23.3 per cent in the case of Burma. Since these
ratlos relate to official debt, they understate the debt-service
burden of some DMCs which were able to saise substantial
amounts In debts not guaranteed by governments. Nevertheless, the ratios represent adequately the debt-service
burden of the majority of DMCs which rely mostly on official
loans. In many DMCs, the debt-service ratio remains low due
to a high grant element in the total Inflow of external
resources. In some cases, an Increase in the ratlo. was
moderated or reversed by the cancellation or rescheduling
of debt repayments that some lenders have allowed in recant years. The Philippines’ overall debt-servicing situation
became difficult due to short-term liquidity problems, and
by the end of 1983 the country sought a three-month
moratorium on debt repayment from Its creditors.

Policy Initiatives of DMCs

In recent years, the maintenance of continued economic
development in the face of adverse international
developments has remained a major focus of DMCs’
domestic economic policies. As the impact of external
developments on the individual economies of DMCs has differed, so have their adjustment policies. However, DMCs have
generally pursued economic policies almed at Improving efficlency of resource use, externa! and Internal balance and
equitable Income distribution. A selective account of policy
initlatives taken by DMCs during 1983 follows.

Fiscal and Monetary Policies

Stringent, budgetary management and tight monetary
policies were pursued by many DMCs due to the scarcity of
financlal resources. The national budgets of Bangladesh,
Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Ss Lanka and Thailand
contained stablilzation measures such as cuts in government
expenditure, reductions in subsidies, improvements in tax
revenues and tower budgetary deficits. Indonesia announced
in May 1983 the rephasing of a large number of new capitaland import-intensive projects. The Republic of Korea
reviewed its Fifth Pian and enhanced the speed and timing
of some development targets such as reducing budget
deficits and effecting a current account surplus in balance
of payments.

india, Indonesia, Republic of Korea and Pakistan were
among the DMCs which pursued a tight money policy during
1983. During the year, real interest rates tended to remain
at positive levels in many DMCs due to the relatively low inflation rates. High real interest rates caused concern in some
DMCs, a few of which — Republic of Korea, Malaysia and
Thailand — reduced nominai interest rates in order to
stimulate investment. Indonesia freed the regulated interest
rates of the dominant state banks and lifted the credit
ceilings imposed by Bank Indonesia on all commercial banks,
beth state and private. india imposed higher reserve requirements on bank deposits when the inflation rate began
increasing toward the end of the year. Sri Lanka maintained
relatively high tevels of interest rates for the purposes of demand management and attracting more private savings.

External Trade Policies

in the light of their weak balance-of-payments position, the
currencies of several OMCs were devalued or allowed to
depreciate during the year. The extent of depreciation of
DMCs’ currencies ranged between 0.7 per cent in the case
of Republic of China and 34.5 per cent in the case of
Philippines. In March 1983, Indonesia devalued its currency
by 28 per cent to strengthen the international competitiveness of non-oll exports and Import-substituting industries. The sharp depreciation of the Philippine currency
was brought about by two devatuations, in June (by 7.3 per
cent} and In October (by 21.4 per cent). Other DMCs
experiencing large depreclations of their currencies during
the year were Fij! (@ per cent), Hong Kong (19.6 per cent), India
{7 per cent), Republic of Korea (6.7 per cent), Papua New
Guinea (12.7 per cent) and Sri Lanka {13,7 per cent).

DMCs took several measures to boost foreign exchange
earnings. Indonesia enforced regulations regarding the
greater use of Indonesian ships in its export and import trade
and made determined and partially successful efforts to promote non-oil exports. Bangladesh initiated steps for setting
up a free trade zone in Dhaka for industries based on airfreighted cargoes. India permitted the setting up of four more
free trade zones and allowed 100 per cent export firms in the
country to sell 25 per cent of their production in the domestic
market, Sri Lanka allocated $3 miltion in its jatest budget to
promote tourism and also moved to Implement a second
phase of the free trade zone at Colombo.

{n some cases, DMCs considered {t necessary to restrict
exports either to improve domestic availabllity or to protect
terms of trade. A conference of forestry officials from the
member countries of ithe Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) recommended that the export of logs from
the reglon be discontinued in order to conserve its forestry
resources and to encourage the export of processed wood,
Major DMC producers of rubber and tin — Indonesia,
Malaysia and Thailand — attempted to restrict exports in
order to Improve the price of those commodities from
depressed levels. Nepal banned the export of rice in order
to counter the effects of a shortfall in the production of
foodgrains. Sri Lanka restricted the export of coconut oil in
order to stabilize the domestic price of this commodity.

Individual import policies were generally dictated by the
pressures on the balance of payments of the country concerned. The Philippines undertook several emergency
measures such as curtailing the importation of non-essential
consumer goods in order to stop the drain on its sharply
reduced foreign exchange resources. On the other hand, the
Republic of China reduced tariff rates and eliminated import
permit requirements in order to stimulate imports of capita!
goods. Bangladesh liberalized imports by reintroducing the
Open General Llcense (OGL) system for industrial and commercial imports. Trade liberalization plans adopted by the
Republic of Korea are aimed at gradually bringing down import tariffs to levels comparable to those of developed
countries.

Energy Programs and Policies

OMCs kept up their efforts to achieve a measure of seifreliance with regard to energy supplies. During the year,
major gains in the production of energy resources were
reported by Bangladesh, India, Malaysia and Thailand. Large
investments in the energy sector were undertaken during
1983 by Bangladesh, Burma, india, Indonesia, Lao PDR,
Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Sri Lankapew a

“and Thailand.

Many DMCs raised the prices of energy products to encourage conservation of energy and to reduce the cost of
government subsidies. Republic of China, India, Republic of
Korea and Nepal are among the DMCs which priced energy
resources ai a high level. In 1983, considerable increases in
domestic prices of petroleum and petroleum products were
announced by Bangladesh, Indonesia and Philippines.

Human Resource Development Policies

OMCs réalize the importance of human resource development both as an input in the process of economic development and as a goal of deveiopment itself. Allocations for
education, health and family welfare have claimed increasing
shares of budget outlays in many OMCs. Indonesia established a separate Ministry of Manpower Development, which
pianned to increase the number of industrial training centers
from 34 to 154 within 1983. Pakistan's Sixth Plan (4983-87)
allocated 11.5 per cent of the total outlay for social infrastructure (education, health, water supply and population planning). The second largest amount in the Philippines’ 1984
budget was allocated for tocal governmenis and the largely
rural based national livelihood program.

Regional Cooperation

Anumber of developments in 1983 contributed to furthering regional cooperation among DMCs.

Atthe 15th meeting of the Economic Ministers of ASEAN
it was agreed that proposed tariff concessions for industrial
joint ventures should be amended. Previously, it was required
that a joint venture be at least 51 per cent owned by two or
more member countries in order to qualify automatically for
a 50 per cent tariff cut after three years; instead, it should
be left to each member country to reach individual decisions
on tariff concessions. The coverage of trade preference exchanges under the Preferential Trade Arrangement increased
from 8,560 products to 18,933 products, while the import ceiling on items in intra-regional trade qualifying for across-theboard tariff cuts of 20-25 per cent was raised from $2.5 million
to $10 million. Operations commenced at Indonesia’s fertilizer plant, the first of the ASEAN large-scale industrial projects to be completed. ASEAN members signed a fishing
accord that provided for technology transfer in aquaculture,
post-harvest technology and marketing of fish and fish
products.!

The foreign ministers of Bangladesh, Bhutan, india,
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka signed an agreement in August establishing a regional organization entitled
the South Asian Regional Cooperation Council. Areas identified for future cooperation were agriculture and rural
development, meteorology, telecommunications, science and
technology, health and population activities, transport, postal
service, sports, art and culture. Tlie foreign ministers of the
seven countries also agreed to continue cooperation among
Rational pianning organizations and academic institutions.

At the 23rd South Pacific Conference, held in October, full
voting rights were extended to all 27 member countries and
territories instead of only 13 members as had previously been
the case and, on this basis, the formula for funding the South
Pacific Conference was modified. It was also decided that

 

1 Srunei became the sixth member country of ASEAN shortly after gaining its
incepencence in January 1984.

no further action be taken on establishing a Pacific Islands
Fund or a Regional Agricultural Stabilization Scheme in view
of the reluctance of various agencies to make contributions
without the commitment of the region’s governments to
them. The issue of merger and rationalization of the region’s
iwo associations — the South Pacific Conference and the
South Pacific Forum — was also taken up for discussion.
It was agreed to await proposals to be presented to the South
Pacific Forum in August 1984.

International Cooperation

Loan commitments received by the DMCs from the Inter
. national Bank for Reconstruction and Development (iBRD)

increased from $4.1 billion in FY 1982 (ending in June) to $4.2
billion in FY 1983. Commitments of International Development Association (IDA) credits increased from $1.7 billion
in FY 1982 to $1.8 billion in FY 1983. The combined credits
from these two sources increased during the period from $5.8
billion to $6.1 billion.

Credit commitments by the International Monetary Fund
(MF) to the region under standby and extended arrangements
decreased to SDR6.0 billion at the end of December 1983
compared with outstanding commitments of SDR6.2 billion
at the end of 1982. Outstanding {MF credit disbursed to DMCs
amounted to SOR3.6 billion as of 31 December 1983 compared with SDR6.8 billion at the end of the previous year.

The resources of the IMF were increased by 47.5 per cent
following formal ratification in November of the pending
eighth quota increase, The quota approval also triggered the
proposed enlargement of the General Arrangement to Borrow
by the Group of 10 and Switzerland. When that loan is in
place, the resources of the IMF will be further augmented
by an additional loan from Saudi Arabia,

At the Williamsburg Summit held in June, the seven major industrial countries — Canada, France, Federal Republic
of Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom and United States
— expressed strong opposition to protectionism and called
for a new round of trade liberalization under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The group failed,
however, to further the proposal for a new conference on the
international monetary system that had been put forward at
the summit of non-aligned countries in New Delhi in March.

UNCTAD VI, held in July in Belgrade, ended with no firm
agreements. The conference adopted by consensus a series
of compromise resolutions but failed to produce new initiatives of financial commitments.

The Tweifth Congress of the World Energy Conference was
held in New Delhi in September. The major themes were international cooperation in energy, increased seif-reliance and
greater exploitation of hydro-electric energy in developing
countries. .

An International Tropical Timber Agreement was concluded in November 1983. This will become effective on
1 October 1984 or thereafter when 12 producing countries
representing at least 55 per cent of the votes and 16 consuming countries with at least 70 per cent of votes have signed,
satified, approved or acceded to the agreement. The pact provides for research and development, seforestation and forest
management, increased processing in developing producer
countries and improvement of marketing and distribution.

PART II: COUNTRY NOTES

Bangladesh

Economic growth in Bangiadesh stagnated in FY 1982
(ending June), but the country. recorded a modest growth in
FY 1983, though far below the 6 per cent average GDP growih
of the period 1977-81. The GDP growth rate in FY 1982 of 0.8
per cent Increased to about 3.3 per cent In FY 1983. With an
annual population growth rate of more than 2.4 per cent, the
GDP growth rates for the two years imply a dectine in per
caplta Income during the perlod. The improvement in the
growth rate during FY 1983 came frorn Increased agricuttural
production as well as growth-orlented policy measures
adopted !n the budget for FY 1983. The budget policles were
aimed at mobilizing resources and providing greater scope
to the private sector.

Foodgrain production In FY 1983 was significantly higher
than even the previous record production fevel ‘reached in
FY 1981; the agricultural sector as a whole achieved a growth
of 4.3 per cent. However, manufacturing output declined by
1.6 per cent, The demand for manufactured products was
weak because of restrictive fiscal and monetary policies
pursued by the Government and depressed agricultural production and [ncomes during FY 1982 and early FY 1983.
Despite higher food production, additional foodgrains had
to be imported under ald programs as food demand Increased
at an even faster pace due to population growth.

The 1983 inflation rate was reduced to 6.9 per cent from
12.8 per cent In 1982 despite upward adjustment In the prices
of some goods and services provided by the Government. The
balance of payments and the budget were under better control In FY 1983 largely due to restrained pubilc expenditure
and Imports. Major public sector corporations showed an
overall profit.

Export earnings Increased by 10 per cent In FY 1983,
boosted by some recovery In the prices of jute goods, while
import payments were 10 per cent less than FY 1982 levels
owing to the slowdown in the import of capital goods, raw
materlais and some consumer goods. Remittances from
abroad Increased by 45 per cent. As a result, the balance of
payments Improved substantially, recording an overati
surplus of $234 mililon in FY 1983 compared with a deficit
of $142 million in FY 1982. }

The budget for FY 1984 maintained the drive toward
domestic economic adjustments initiated In the previous
budget. In real terms government expenditure during FY 1984
was maintalned at about the same level as in the FY 1983
budget. Major steps were taken to mobilize more resources
through Improvements in the collection and coverage of
taxes and higher prices for goods and services provided by
public corporations. Procurement prices of rice and wheat
were raised, and the scope of foodgrain rationing was
reduced, In the area of external trade, the Government
liberalized imports, while the value of the currency was
allowed to depreciate.

Bhutan

In FY 1983 (ending in March) the agricultural sector in
S8hutan performed weil; FY 1984 crops are also expected fo
be good. As a result, food supplies were adequate and price
increases moderate. Aithough no precise figure is available,
it is believed that the FY 1983 growth rate was lower than
the estimated average 6 per cent rate recorded in the three

previous years. This partially reflects a weakening of the contribution of the forestry sector due to sectoral reorganization.

The Government has been incurring large overall budget
deficits, averaging more than 20 per cent of GDP in recent
years, reflecting a high level of capital expenditure and the
Government’s inability to mobilize sufficient domestic
resources. These large deficits were mainly financed by considerable assistance received on a grant basis from India.
The Government aims to reduce budget deficits through
tighter control of current expenditure and by increasing
revenue. A number of flscat reforms Introduced In the FY 1983
budget were Intended to Improve control over expenditure,
Increase revenue from existing taxes and widen the tax base.

The national budget for FY 1984 provided for a total expenditure of Nu712 million ($71 million}, an increase of 28
per cent over the FY 1983 revised estimates; Nu495 million
($49 mililon), or 70 per cent of the total, was allocated to
developmen. These figures reflected the Government's decision to maintain current expenditure at a level roughly equal
to domestic revenue while relying in the medium-term on
foreign assistance to finance development expenditure. It
is anticipated that revenue will increase sharply in FY 1985
when the Chukka Hydroelectric Power Project comes
onstream and power is exported to India. This new source
of revenue will have major implications for future budgets.

The merchandise trade deficit for FY 1983 amounted to
Nu347 million ($34 million} but was more than covered by external aid. International reserves at the end of September
1983 reached $35 million, of which the equivaient of $25
milllon was held in indlan rupees and the rest in convertible
currencies. The reserves were equivalent to 8.2 months’
imports.

Burma

The strong performance of the Burmese economy since
FY 1978 somewhat weakened In FY 1984 (ending March). GDP
grew 5.6 per cent In FY 1984 compared with the FY 1983
growth of 6 per cent. Agricultural production grew by 4.7 per
cent compared with 6.8 per cent growth recorded In FY 1983.
However, output of the manufacturing, construction and
mining sectors Increased at higher rates, by 8.9 per cent, 8.1
per cent and 23.9 per cent, respectively, in FY 1984 compared
with growth rates of 6.2 per cent, 6.3 per cent and 12.0 per
cent, respectively, in FY 1983.

Burma has maintained a record of price stability in recent
years. The consumer price index increased by 4.1 per cent
in 1981, by 5.2 per cent in 1982 and by 5.7 per cent in 1983.

The consolidated public sector budget estimate for FY
1984 showed a 10 per cent increase in current receipts and
an 11 per cent increase in current expenditure. Capital expenditure, however, declined by about 2 per cent. The overal]
deficit was estimated at about K7 billion ($0.9 billion), or 14
per cent of GDP,

During 1980-82, exports continuously declined, while imports kept on rising. Falling export receipts, coupled with
Increasing import payments, resulted in a widening of the
trade deficit from $226 million in 1980 to $469 million in 4982.
in view of the difficult external resources position, the
Government planned to reduce the balance-of-payments
deficit by cutting imports and boosting exports. This goal
was reached in 1983 as exports rose to $439 million, imports
declined to $730 million and the trade deficit narrowed to
$291 milllon. However, International reserves fell sharply to
$76.5 million at the end of 1983, equivalent to 1.3 months’
imports.In FY 1984, the Government, while pursuing a more restrictive fiscal policy aimed at reducing the high budget deficit,
scaled down several investment projects. It plans to promote
more export-oriented projects in the future.

Republic of China

In 1983, the Republic of China registered GDP growth of
7 per cent, a significant increase from the 3.4 per cent growth
registered in 1982. The primary factor behind the recovery
was an upsurge in export growth which surpassed that of
all other Asian NICs. Improvement in United States’ import
demand and the strength of the US dollar were largely responsible for the gain.

The inflation rate in 1983 was lower than in 1982, with consumer prices increasing by 1.4 per cent compared with an
increase of 3 per cent in 1982. This price stability was
achieved in the face of the sharp economic recovery.

The country’s trade surplus increased from $3.3 billion in
1982 to $4.8 billion in 1983, as imports grew slower than exports. This surplus has begun to exert upward pressure on
the local currency in relation to the US dollar. This tendency could possibly affect future export growth. To restrain the
pressure and stimulate exports, the Government increased
the limits on bank dealings in foreign exchange, in particular
US dollars. During 1983, imports of capital goods were sluggish, indicating continuing hesitation with regard to business
Investment. In an effort to stimulate purchases of capital
goods from abroad, the Government reduced tariff rates and
eliminated import permit requirements. Other incentives to
business included the extension of tax credits for investment
and the reduction of interest rates for short-term loans. The
Central Bank maintained an expansionary monetary policy.

Fiji

The GDP of Fiji, which had declined 1.2 per cent in 1982,
declined a further 6.8 per cent in 1983. An agro-based export economy, Fiji's GDP growth is heavily influenced by international market conditions and weather, both of which
were unfavorable in 1983. The prices of Fiji's major exports
remained depressed, and two cyclones in the early part of
the year and prolonged drought conditions in the main
agricultural areas severely affected agricultural production
and economic activity. Sugar production was almost halved
from 487,000 tons in 1982 to 276,000 tons in 1983; the decline
in the sugarcane farmers’ incomes had widespread effect
on other sectors. However, the impact of low production
levels on exports and growers’ incomes was partly offset by
sales of sugar from stocks. White sugar was imported for
domestic use, allowing all domestic production to be used
for meeting export contracts.

Government revenue exceeded the budget estimates mainly due to the increased collections of customs and excise
Guties. In addition, government capital expenditure was considerably iower than that in the previous year. As a result,
the overall deficit declined to F$68 million ($67.3 million)
compared with the 1983 budget estimate of F$77 million
{876.3 million).

The money supply increased by 9 per cent in 1983 and 4
per cent in 1982 compared with growth of 19 per cent in

. 1981. Smaller increases in bank credit to public entities and
Private sector contributed to the lower rate of monetary expansion in recent years. The consumer price index, which
increased by 14.5 per cent in 1980 and 11.2 per cent in 1981,
recorded a much lower increase of 7 per cent in 1982 and
this trend continued with a 6.8 per cent rise in 1983.

The adverse impact of the cyclone and drought on export
receipts was largely offset by the inflows of insurance
payments. International reserves stood at $116.2 million at
the end of 1983, which represented about 2.8 months’
imports.

Heng Kong

A recovery in the export sector during 1983 increased Hong
Kong’s GDP growth to 5.9 per cent, following a 1.1 per cent
rise in the previous year. Exports rose by 5.3 per cent due
to the pick-up in demand for manufactured exports which,
in turn, led to an improvement in the local employment situation. Private consumption increased by 93.5 per cent and
government spending on goods and services increased by
3.8 per cent, but gross fixed capital formation declined by
6.5 per cent. During the year, there was a marked shift of
resources and efforts away from the domestically oriented
tertiary sector and towards manufacturing for export.

The Hong Kong currency depreciated on the foreign exchange markets to a low of HK$9.55 to US$1.00. To contain
the depreciation of the Hong Kong dollar, the Government
pegged the local currency at the rate of HK$7.80 to US$1.00
and in October abolished the 10 per cent tax on interest
earnings from Hong Kong doliar deposits.

The inflation rate during 1983 remained at 10 per cent,
about the same as in 1982, mainly due to the impact of the
large currency depreciation on domestic prices.

Imports rose by 2.5 per cent, while exports expanded by
5.3 per cent, thus reducing the trade deficit in 1983 to $2
billion compared with $2.6 billion in 1982. Net earnings from
services increased sharply due to the devaluation and helped
further improve Hong Kong’s current account balance.

The budget for FY 1984 (ending in March} showed a decline
of HK$1 billion ($135 million) in both government revenue and
government expenditure. Nevertheless, there was a large
overall deficit of HKS3.3 biltion ($446 million) due to the shortfall in government revenue from land sales. This was
financed mainly from fiscal reserves accumulated in the past.

India

The Indian economy showed healthy growth performance
during FY 1984 (ending in March) when GDP growth recovered
to around 6.5 per cent compared with the 2 per cent growth
of FY 1983. This improved performance was shared by most
sectors, but a spurt in agricultural production was the prime
mover of the economy during the year. Aided by normal monsoon rains throughout the country, the output of major
foodgrains increased by 12 per cent, to a record 143 million
tons. The overall growth rate of the agricultural sector was
9 per cent, and the manufacturing sector grew by 4 per
cent. Public sector investments increased sharply during the
year,

India experienced an increase in its inflation rate from 8.3
per cent in 1982 to 10.3 per cent in 1983 mainly due to increases in the prices of milk products, vegetables and fruits
and some non-food goods and services (clothing, school fees
and personal care), although the Government pursued a tight
money policy to keep inflation in check. In November 1983,
when inflation started to rise, the Reserve Bank of India increased the reserve requirements of commercial banks
against their deposit liabilities by 10 per cent, thereby absorbing considerable excess liquidity in the banking system.

The budgetary provisions for the FY 1984 central development plan amounted to Rs 138.7 billion ($13.8 billion), 26 per
cent higher than the total FY 1983 central plan outlay of

1820

Rs110 billlon ($41.0 billion). The major allocations were
Rs 15.5 billion ($1.6 billion) for social and community services,
Rs1i bililon ($1.10 billion) for agriculture and allied services,
Rs2 billion ($2.90 billion) for industry and minerais, Rs10.6
billion ($1.06 billion) for water and power development and
Rs11.5 billion ($1.15 billion) for transport and communications. Family planning continued to receive emphasis in the
FY 1984 budget with Rs3.3 billion ($0.3 biilion) provided for
family welfare. Within industry and minerals, the energy sector recelved an alfocation of Rst2 billion ($1.2 blftion).

indta's trade deficit declined from $8.7 bliilon In 1982 to
$5.0 dilifon In 1983. WhHe exports Increased by 4.1 per cent,
imports declined by 2.3 percent. The deciine In imports was
due to a significant increase in domestic of! production and
a consequent reduction in oil imports. Foodgrain Imports
during the year to support the pubilc distribution system remalned at a high level, but India’s Internatlonal reserves also
remained high at $5.8 billion, equivalent to 4.9 months’
imports.

The FY 1984 budget tightened the import policy while providing a number of incentives to exporters. The Government
permitted the setting up of four more export processing zones
in Cochin, Madras, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. The 100
per cent export firms in the country were allowed to sel! 25
per cent of their production in the domestic market. Import
of machinery and raw matertals by exporters was liberalized.

Indonesia

Indonesia's GDP growth in 1983 was about 2.9 per cent,
an improvement over the 2.2 per cent Increase In
1982. Although external demand and prices Improved for a
number of Indonesia’s major non-ol! exports, domestic demand remained weak due to stsIngent monetary and fiscal
policies and to the terms of trade losses suffered in 1982.

The domestic Inffation rate Increased from 9.7 per cent In
1982 to 11.5 per cent In 1983 because of the cost-push effects of large upward adjustments in domestic oil prices In
danuary and the 28 per cent currency devaluation in March.

The trade surplus shrank from $11.9 blilllon In 1981 to $5.4
bliflon In 1982 and $4.6 billion in 1983, due mainly to the
depressed market for oil. A large volume of foodgrain imports was also required to offset shortfalls in food productlon. The country's overall external resource position
remained unfavorable in 1983 with an officially projected current account deficit of $5.9 billion, close to the $5.5 billion
deficit incurred in 1982.

During 1983, the Government took a series of measures
to improve the external resource positlon in the short and
medium-terms and to sustain development momentum. In
January, domestic prices of oil products were raised by
amounts ranging between 11 and 71 per cent and in March
a currency devaluation of 28 per cent strengthened the international competitiveness of the country’s non-oll exports
and import substituting industries. In May, the Government
announced the rephasing of several large industrial projects
and a reduction in public investment by about $10 billion, In
the middle of the year, major financial reforms were imptemented to: (i) remove credit ceilings, (i} deregulate lending and deposit rates of state commercial banks, (iii) reduce
subsidized rediscounting and (iv} abolish the interest, dividend and royalty tax on foreign currency deposits held by
domestic banks, thereby discouraging outflows of foreign
exchange.

The scascity of resources necessitated the adoption of an
austere budget for FY 1984, as in FY 1983, Parliament's adop
tion of three tax laws, to be implemented in 1984, has initiated
a major fiscal reform.

Republic of Korea

After 1980, when GDP fell by 3.6 per cent, the Republic of
Korea began to show steady growth which largely regained
the momentum of the 1970s. GDP growth was 5.4 per cent
in 1981 and 5.8 per cent In 1982 — in the face of a worldwide
economic decline. !n 1983, GDP grew by 8.7 per cent.

The most signiflcant development In 1983 was the revival
in manufacturing, with productlon increasing by 15.5 per
cent. However, construction, with real growth of 22.4 per
cenit, was once more the most rapldiy growing sector. Domestic demand provided the major impetus to growth,
although revival of exports during the second half of the year
rethforced growth momentum.

Whereas in the past growth was accompanied by high inflation, during 1983 the inflation rate was low and steadily
declined. The consumer price index rose only by 3.4 per cent
in 1983 compared with the increase of 7.3 per cent in 1982;
a contributing factor was the Government’s tight money
policy.

Exports increased more rapidly than imports, and the 1983
trade deficit was lower than that of 1982. Despite a deterioration In invisIble trade and net transfers, the current account
deficit declined from $2.7 billion in 1982 to $1.6 biillon In
4983. Durlng 1983, the current account deficit was partly offset by a sharp increase in capital inflows — mainly atirlbutable to commercial borrowings — with the result that
the overall balance-of-payments deficit in 1983 was lower
than In 1982.

The Government continued to pursue the liberalization
policles initlated under the Fifth Pian and restrictions ona
number of Import items were IIfted. The Government planned
to lower gradually the ievel of Import duties to reach the levels
prevalent in developed couniries by 1988. In the financtal
sector, denationalization of commercial banks was completed early in the year, although Interest rates remained subject to official controls. Recent developments in the
economy led to a review of the Flith Plan, although its underlying philosophy of relying on market forces to spur development remained unchanged. The timing of certain targets,
such as reducing budget deficits and achieving a current account surpius in balance of payments, were advanced.

Lao PDR ;

In 1982, drought in Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao
PDR) resulted in stagnation of rice production and a GDP
growth of only 1 per cent. in 1983, however, the harvest improved and GDP growth was high enough to yield some
increase in per capita income.

Inflation moderated in 1983 as money supply growth was
reduced, and the prices of major Imported items (e.g., oil,
machinery and manufactured goods} were relatively stable.

Overall export earnings did not improve as much as in 1982,
although there was some improvement in exports other than
electricity. The current account deficit, which was $94
million or 24 per cent of GDP in 1982, also remained at a high
tevel in 1983.

Greater efforts were made in #983 to boost rice selfsufficiency and to revive lagging exports, especialy logs and
wood products, tin and various agricultural goods. Efforts
were also made to keep budgetary deficits and money supply
growth under control to avoid Inflationary pressures.

in order to rectify the trade imbalance, increase interna-TECHNICIANS at the Vientiane Plain Rural Eleciritication Project in Lao POR, for which the Bank has approved
$10.6 million in two loans. This Project will help boost food
production through pump irrigation schemes, assist industrial growth and raise the living standards of the focal
farmers.

tional reserves and reduce the debt-servicing burden,
emphasis was placed on development projects that involved
short gestation periods and had potential for export production or import substitution.

Malaysia

In 1983, Malaysia recorded a GDP growth rate of 5.6 per
cent, marginally above the 5.2 per cent growth of
1982, Growth accelerated in most sectors, except agriculture
and construction where growth decelerated to 2.1 per cent
and 8.4 per cent, respectively. Mining sector output showed
an improvement of 20.2 per cent over the 1982 level, with large
expansions in crude oil and natural gas production. Tin output continued to decline.

The public sector was less expansionary in 1983 than in
1882 owing to a reduction in government expenditure, Moderation in money supply growth and domestic demand led to a fall in the inflation rate from 5.8 per cent in
1982 to 4 per cent in 1983.

Due to a 15 per cent increase in exports compared with
47 per cent increase in imports, the trade account registered
4 Surplus of $470 million compared with a $368 million deficit

in 1982. Nevertheless, the current account deficit amounted
to $2.8 billion and was financed by large capital inflows. The
currency exchange rate remained steady in 1983, strengthening against most currencies but depreciated slightly
against the US dollar.

The 1984 budget introduced an import duty on heavy construction equipment, reimposed a sales tax on building
materials and included various other tax reforms. To narrow
the deficit on the invisible account, the shipping industry was
granted additional tax incentives.

In 1983, adjusting government expenditure to the tight
resource position was a major issue. The focus of adjustment was placed on development expenditure. An investment priority review was completed during the year to assist
in making expenditure cuts. The Government prepared a revised National Agricultural Policy to address the structural
problems evident in the agriculture sector. Interest. on
government securities was exempted from taxation to make
them more attractive to investors. A commercial bank
operating on Islamic principles and with the third largest
paid-up capital among commercial banks was opened. To
stabilize the price of rubber, trading in rubber futures was
initiated on the Kuala Lumpur Commodity Exchange. The
reduction of dependence on oil, gas and coal as sources of
energy continued to be emphasized, and the relative roles
of the public and private sectors came under review, particularly in regard to the development of the industry sector.

Nepal

Nepal’s economic performance in FY 1983 (ending in July) suffered principally from the adverse impact of a severe
drought. GDP declined by 0,9 per cent, the 4.3 per cent
growth in the non-agricultural sector being more than offset by a 4.5 per cent decline in agricultural production.

Foodgrain output during FY 1983 declined by 16 per cent,
with production of paddy, the most severely affected crop,
declining by 28 per cent. Output of most cash crops, such
as oilseeds, tobacco and jute, was also below FY 1982 levels.

The Government’s FY 1983 budget showed a large increase
in the deficit, owing to a sharp increase in actual expenditure
and a shortfall in revenue. The inflation rate, which slowed
from 14.6 per cent in FY 1981 to 10.6 per cent in FY 1982, accelerated in FY 1983 to 12.3 per cent because of poor
harvests, increases in the prices of goods supptied by the
Government (rice in food-deficit areas, bricks, cement and
firewood) and increased government deficit spending.

The balance of trade position deteriorated during FY 1983
as export earnings were much lower than in FY 1982 and imports increased considerably. However, the deterioration in
the overall payments position was moderated by the
availability of more foreign ioans and grants connected with
emergency food aid for drought victims. Internationa!
reserves at the end of 1983 stood at $133.6 million, equivalent
to 3.7 months’ imports.

In December 1982, the Nepalese currency was devalued
by 7.7 per centin relation to the US dollar in order to eliminate
the broken cross rates that had emerged between the
Nepalese currency, the US dollar and the Indian currency. In
June 1983, to avoid the problem of broken cross rate in the

‘future, the Government pegged the Nepalese currency to a

basket of currencies. To combat inflationary pressures in
the economy, the budget for FY 1984 adopted austerity
measures, including cuts in public expenditure. The Government has also banned the export of rice in view of the shortfail in foodgrain production.

2122

Pakistan

Pakistan recorded high economic growth in FY 1983 (ending in June). GDP grew by 5.8 per cent, led by an 8.3 per cent
growth In manufacturing and a 4.8 per cent growth in
agricufture, compared with the FY 1982 GDP growth rate of
5.6 per cent. The current account deficit narrowed and inflation moderated during the year.

The inflation rate fell to 5.9 per cent during FY 1983 from
7.4 per cent In FY 1982. improved domesitle avallability of
goods, stabtilty In the prices of crucial imports, including ol,
and responsible fiscal and monetary management reduced
Inflatlonary pressures,

The current account deficit fell to $0.56 bililon in FY 1983
from $1.6 billion In FY 1982. Exports and worker remittances
rose sharply following the delinking of Pakistan’s currency
from the US dollar and the consequent cusrency depreciatlon In relatlon to the US doliar. Exports increased by 17.6
per cent in FY 1983 compared with a 24.6 per cent decline
in FY 1982, and overseas remittances reached $2.9 billion
In FY 1983, about as much as earnings from all merchandise
exports. These developments in the current account,
together with the recovery in long-term capital inflows as a
result of some success in attracting foreign investment and
the use of a substantial IMF extended fund facility, resulted
in a significant surplus in the overall balance of
payments. International reserves Increased from $1.5 biltion
in 1982 to $2.7 bdilllon in 1983, equivalent to 6.3 months’
imports.

Despite encouraging trends In the growth of output, improved overall economic management, Increased rellance on
market forces and success In attracting foreign investment,
several difficulties remain. These are reflected In the continulng Imbalance between saving and Investment, low Investment rates, a substantial gap between Imports and exports
and domestic production bottlenecks caused by the large
exodus of workers to foreign countries. Lesser re!lance on
forelgn workers in Middie East countries will favor Pakistan’s
supply of manpower resources, but at the same time this will
adversely affect the availabllity of foreign exchange and national savings through remittances.

Papua New Guinea

Preliminary estimates indicate that1983 GDP growth in
Papua New Guinea was higher than the 1.6 per cent growth
registered in 1982. The higher growth rate was mainly due
to improved export performance and increases in private investment, particularly in the mining sector. The inflation rate
rose to 9.9 per cent In 1983 from 3.9 per cent In 1982, due
to increases !n the prices of imported goods caused by a5.5
per cent currency devaluation in March 1983.

The export of copra, coffee and timber, among other items,
substantially contributed to foreign exchange earnings,
reflecting improved export prices for these commodities. The
value of exports was $839 milfion in 1983 while imports
amounted to $995 million. The trade deficit declined from
$247 million to $156 miilion. The overall balance of payments
showed a surplus of $52 million in 1983 compared with a
deficit of $38 million in 1982. international reserves were
about $476 million at the end of 1983, equivalent to 6 months’
imports,

During 1983, the Government's financial policy was
directed towards reversing the trend of rising government expenditure. Some retrenchment of staff, reduced authoriza
tions for other current expenditure and underspending on
some public works projects reduced current expenditure by
about $ per cent in 1883. This about matched the revenue
shortfall.

tn addition to adjustments in public expenditure, efforts
were made toward increasing domestic resource mobilization. Excise tax rates were raised on items such as
petroleum products, cigarettes and beer; import duties on
luxury items were ralsed and the tariff schedule was
reclassified, with substantial increases in Import duties on
motor vehicle as weil as vehicle registration fees. In view
of the expected shortfall in revenue collectlons, the Government made efforis to improve tax administration and
penalties on tax evasion were stiffened. These measures
were designed to raise K20 million ($24,1 million) in 1982 and
an added K15-K20 million ($18.1-$24.1 miilion) in
1983. Statutory authorities undertaking commercial activities
were subjected to closer government scrutiny and management reviews; where necessary, substantial increases in
charges for services provided by them were effected in order
to improve their financial performance.

The devaluation of the Australian dollar in March 1983 was |

immediately fotiowed by currency devaluation by Papua New
Guinea, resulting in an overall devajuation of 5.5 per cent
against the trade-weighted basket of currencies. This was
the first currency devaluation since independence in
September 1975.

Philippines

The Philippines’ GDP growth rate declined in 1983 to 7 per
cent from about 3 per cent in 1982, Due to severe external
sesource constraints and exchange rate and other uncertainties, the performance of the Industrial and the services sectors was weak. At the same time, agricultural output
declined as drought hit the production of rice and maize. External demand and increases in the prices of copper, goid
and siiver contributed to some production gains in the mining sector.

The inflation rate In 1983 was 10.8 per cent compared with
11 percentin 1982. The rate of increase in consumer prices,
which was easing in the first six months, rose sharply during
the second haiff of the year as a consequence of currency
devaiuations in June and October, the reduction of government subsidies on petroleum products and various other
influences such as minimum wage adjustments.

While merchandise exports decreased, the decline in imports was even larger, so that the 1983 trade deficit narrowed
to $3.1 billion from $3.3 billion in 1982. The 1983 current account deficit was $3.3 billion compared with $3.4 billion in
1982. The international reserves were $903 million,
equivalent to 1.4 months’ imports.

Foreign exchange scarcity and fiscal constraints led the
Government to defer some major industrial projects. The
Central Bank expanded Its span of administrative controls
by requiring one month’s advance approval for imports of
equipment and spare parts exceeding certain limits. The two
exchange rate adjustments effectively devalued the currency by 34.5 per cent since the end of 1982. This large exchange rate adjustment was designed to improve the balance
of payments by encouraging exports and increasing the costs
ofimports. The remaining ceilings on short-term loans were

temoved at the beginning of the year completing the’

deregulation of interest rates. The move was intended not
only to stimulate financial savings but also to promote efficlent allocation of scarce resources.Singapore

Singapore's GDP grew 7.9 per cent in 1983 compared with
6.3 per cent in 1982. Growth was spurred by the turnaround
in the manufacturing sector and the improved growth in the
financial and business services sector.

Singapore sustained its domestic price stability during the
year as the strength of the local currency kept the prices of
imports down. Consumer prices rose by only 1.2 per cent
during 1983 compared with 3.9 per cent in 1982.

Singapore was able to take advantage of the recovery in
the United States. Exports increased by 5.1 per cent, but
imports remained unchanged. Consequently, the trade
deficit decreased from $7.4 billion in 1982 to $6.3 billion in
1983.

Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka’s 1983 GDP growth was about 4.7 per cent compared with 5.1 per cent in 1982. The slowdown was mainly
due to lower growth in agricultural production resulting from
the drought in early 1983 and, also, to the adverse impact
of the July disturbances on economic activities. Coconut
and tea production declined in 1983 due to adverse seasonal
conditions which, in turn, had affected the processing
industries.

The 1983 inflation rate increased to 14 per cent from 10.8
per cent in 1982. The increase in inflationary pressure was
due to credit expansion after July 1983, devaluation of the
currency and increases in administered prices. Overall
budgetary deficits in 1983 declined; although Current expenditure was higher than expected as a result of rehabilitation
measures, current revenue increased and capital expenditure
was reduced drastically.

The deficit in the trade account was reduced during 1983
to $835 million compared with $985 million in 1982. Exports
increased due mainly to the recent rise in commodity prices,
especially the prices of coconut and tea, while imports were
lower.

The 1983 budget introduced several measures to mobilize
domestic resources. The basic rate of the business turnover
tax was increased to 4 per cent. Commodities such as rice
and flour, which enjoyed the status of duty-free imports, have
been subjected to a 5per cent duty. Duties on other imports
have been increased by between 2.5 and 10 percentage
points. Most tax holidays have been abolished, with the major exception of a continuing five-year tax holiday on profits
from non-traditional exports.

To improve the competitiveness of the economy the
Government devalued the currency by about 10 per cent in
March 1983 and again by about § per cent in July. Relatively high interest rates were maintained both to attract more
Private savings and for demand management purposes. Domestic administered prices of imported goods
were adjusted in line with world prices and the new exchange
fates.

Thailand

During 1983, economic activity recovered from the recession of the previous year. Lower domestic interest rates,
Stable oil prices and inventory restocking led to expansion
in output. The revival was strong in construction materials
for urban housing, consumer durable industries and, to a
lesser extent, in food and beverages. Preliminary estimates
for 1983 indicate a 5.8 per cent growth in GDP, comprising
growth of 3 per cent in agriculture and 8 per cent in in
dustry. The mining sector also improved in 1983 as the first
oil shipments were made from Larn Krabue field.

Inflation continued to decline from 5.4 per cent in 1982 to
3.8 per cent in 1983. Easier credit conditions helped
domestic demand to pick up, but some of this spilled into
import demand; budget austerity moderated public sector
demand. Drought early in 1983 kept rice output below the
tecord level of 1982. However, as world demand was down
from 1982 levels, rice prices remained low.

Exports declined by 10 per cent, while imports were up by
18.4 per cent. This produced a 1983 trade deficit of $3.4
billion compared with $1.6 billion in 1982.

The promotion of economic recovery and reduction of the
overall budget deficit were emphasized in 1983. Monetary
policy was expansionary and interest rates were
reduced. The record deficit in the 1982 budget prompted @
teduction in the growth of public expenditure, improvements
in tax administration and higher taxes on luxuryimports. Further restrictive measures might be taken if shortfalls in
revenues occur.

Tonga

During 1983, the Kingdom of Tonga continued with
reconstruction work fotlowing the cyclone in March
1982. Although It is difficult, in the absence of up-to-date national accounts statistics, to provide an estimate for the 1983
GOP, it seems to have been slightly higher than the 1982 GDP.

The consumer price index increased by 5.9 per cent during 1983 compared with an increase of 10.8 per cent in
4982. The sharp drop in the inflation rate was mainly due
to a reduction in the price of some local food items.

The budget for FY 1984 (ending in June} provides for an
expenditure of T$41 million ($38 million), 58 per cent of which
is for development. The development budget is to be largely financed by external assistance.

Tonga had a 1983 trade deficit of $40 million. This was
substantially covered by net unrequited transfers, mainly
overseas remittances from workers. The country enjoyed a
substantial overall balance-of-payments surplus.

The Government took a number of steps in the FY 1984
budget to help the economic recovery. The policy measures
included (i) the liberalization of the land laws to allow greater
freedom of leasing !and on a long-term basis for agricultural
use; (ii) the widening of the list of duty-free consumer goods
to encourage tourism: (iii} the abolition of withholding tax
on export of produce; and (iv) tax concessions to attract new
industries into the country.

Conclusion

During 1983, DMCs were generally able to improve their
GDP growth rates while containing rates of inflation and
teducing balance-of-payments deficits. These favorable
developments largely resulted from good weather in many
DMCs, stable prices of foodgrains and oil and the beneficial
impact of the recovery of the world economy. The economic
adjustments and policy reforms effected by the DMCs in recent years also contributed to their positive economic performance and enabled them to take advantage of the improvement in the world economy. The Bank's lending and
technical assistance operations during 1983, which supported the DMCs’ long-term efforts and to some extent helped
to relieve the constraints on development, are discussed in
detail in subsequent chapters.

23OPERATIONS AND POLICIES

Lending Operations

TOTAL LOAN approvals during the year amounted to $1,893
million compared with $1,731 million in the previous
year. Loans from ordinary capital resources (OCR) in 1983
amounted to $1,189.8 million, an increase of 0.4 per cent in
nominal terms over the corresponding figure of $1,184.5
million in 1982, while loans from Special Funds (SF), amounting to $703.4 million, showed an increase of 28.8 per cent
in nominal terms over the 1982 figure of $546.1 million.

Bank lending (OCR and SF} increased by 9.4 per cent in
nominal terms in 1983, while over the five-year period 1979-83
the annual increase averaged 11 per cent in nominal
terms. The improved iending performance in 1983 was
achieved despite continued problems of adjustment faced
by those developing member countries (DMCs) which were
still trying to overcome the effects of the prolonged global
recession. Responding to a situation generally characterized
by budgetary constraints and acute shortages of local curtency resources, the Bank approved in 1983 four Special
Assistance !oans — one each to Bangladesh, Philippines.
Sri Lanka and Western Samoa — tofalling nearly $60
million. These provided additional foreign exchange for highpriority, ongoing Bank-financed projects in which implementation has been hampered by local currency shortages. The
timely completion of these projects would also contribute
to effective utilization of investments already made in them.

Following the Bank's decision in March 1983 to commence
equity investment operations so as to broaden its support
for private enterprises, the Bank approved its first two equity investments, one each in Republic of Korea’ and
Pakistan. During the year, the Bank also approved four sector
loans and three program loans compared with only two sector loans approved in 1982.

During the year, 55 loans for 53 projects in 17 DMCs were
approved compared with §7 loans for 56 projects in 13 DMCs
'n 1982. Of these, two projects in Pakistan — the Development Financing Loan and Guddu Gas Turbine (Combined

ore ge and flood contro! in an area with rich potential for inaed rice production.

Cycle Power) Project — received blended loans, or, in other
words, financing from both OCR and SF.

The average size of loans increased from $30.4 million in
1982 to $34.4 million in 1983. The average size of OCR loans
increased sharply from $37 million in 1982 to $45.8 million
in 1983, while the average size of SF loans increased from
$21.8 million to $24.3 million over the same period. The increase in 1983 was mainly due to the financing of a large
number of medium to large-sized projects and increased local
cost financing.

In 1983, about 96 per cent of SF loans went to the lowincome DMCs with a per capita gross national product (GNP)
in 1981 of less than $350.

During the year, five DMCs received loans exclusively from
OCR: Indonesia ($426.2 million), Philippines ($234.5 million),
Republic of Korea ($192.8 million), Thailand ($114 million) and
Malaysia ($82.5 million).

Two DMCs received loans from both OCR and SF: Pakistan
$312.1 million ($126.8 million from OCR and $185.3 million
from SF), and Papua New Guinea $28 million ($13 million from
OGR and $16 million from SF).

Ten DMCs received loans exclusively from SF: Bangladesh
{$273.6 million), Nepal ($82.7 million), Burma ($79.6 million),
Sri Lanka ($35.42 million), Lao PDR ($14.3 million), Solomon
Islands ($7.75 million), Bhutan ($5 million), Tonga ($2.2
million), Western Samoa ($1.55 million) and Vanuatu ($1.10
million).

Funds contributed by official and commercial co-financiers
in 1983 amounted to $309 million compared with $699 million
in 1982. The decline in co-financing is attributable to the
absence of large-sized projects in which co-financing could
have been arranged with the World Bank or other donors as
was the case in 1982. it also reflected sluggish economic
activity and resource constraints in DMCs which affected investment programs, especially in the industrial and energy
sectors.

In 1983, as in the past, the Agriculture and Agro-Industry
sector accounted for the largest amount of Bank lending,
although its share fell marginally to 34.2 per cent of the total
from 35.9 per centin 1982. The Energy sector accounted for
23.8 per cent of total lending in 1983, considerably less than
Its 29.7 per cent share in 1982.

On the other hand, the share of lending for social infrastructure projects more than doubled to 22.3 per cent of
total lending from about 10 per cent in 1982. Lending to
development finance institutions (DFts) also increased from
8.6 per cent of total Bank lending in 1982 to 10.8 per cent
of total lending in 1983. There was, however, a significant
decrease In lending to the Transport and Communications
sector which accounted for only 3.5 per cent of the total lending during the year compared with 14.9 per cent in 1982. This
was due partly to special circumstances and partly to the
cyclical nature of Bank lending in certaln sectors.

The total cost of projects approved — excluding five DFI
loans, three program Joans, four sector loans and four Special
Assistance foans — is estimated at $2,488 million. Direct
Bank financing accounted for about 52 per cent of the total
project costs. On the basis of the Bank's past experience,
itis estimated that the total cost of subloan projects to be
financed by the five DFI loans will be about $1,141
mililon. The projects to be financed by the three program
loans, four sector loans and four Specia! Assistance loans
will Involve an estlmated tota! cost of $1,005 million,

reached $13,395 million for 611 projects in 27 DMCs. Of this
‘total, loans amounting to $9,174 million were from OCR and
$4,221 million were from SF.

In 1983, local cost financing (LCF) exciusive of Special
Assistance loans amounted to $216.5 million for 25 projects
in 12 DMCs. Of this, $100.6 million was from OCR and $115.9
million from SF, representing 8.5 per cent and 16.5 per cent,
respectively, of OCR and SF loans approved during the
year. At the end of 1983, the Bank had provided a total of
$826.5 million in LCF.

Co-Financing

During the year, the Bank continued its efforts to arrange
co-financing of development projects with external
sources. A total of 18 projects were co-financed, with cofinanciers contributing $309 million and the Bank $763
million. This compared with 25 projects co-financed in 1982
for which co-financiers provided $699 million and the Bank
$878 million. The decrease in co-financing was attributable
to the absence of large-sized projects for which co-financing
could be arranged as in previous years and to the scating

down by DMCs of their development programs, especially
in the industrial and energy sectors, in the wake of the prolonged worldwide recession.

By the end of 1983, co-financing had been arranged for 153
Bank-assisted projects, with funds provided by co-financiers
amounting to $3,550 million and Bank financing for these
projects amounting to $4,624 million.

In 1983, official sources provided funds amounting to
$128.4 million for 13 projects compared with $423 million for
46 projects in 1982. The share of official sources in the total
amount of co-financing dropped from 61 per cent in 1982 to
only 42 per cent in 1983. Five member countries — Australia,
Canada, Finland, Norway and United States — provided $68.5
million and multilateral sources, comprising the European
Economic Community (EEC), International Fund for
Agricultural Development ({FAD)}, Islamic Development Bank

_ (lsDB), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and

the World Bank Group, contributed $59.9 million.

Co-financing with commercial sources also decreased in
1983, totalling $180.4 million in respect of five projects and
accounting for 58 per cent of all co-financing during the
year. This compared with commercial co-financing of $260.6
mifttion in respect of nine projects in 1982.

During 1983, complementary co-financing with commercial sources was undertaken for the first time. Two loans
were approved under this new funding technique, the
Hetauda Cement (Supplementary and Complementary) Projectin Nepal, where a syndicate of banks led by Lloyds Bank
International, Ltd. raised $13 million, and the Gas Purification and Compression Project in Pakistan, where a syndicate
of banks ted by the Toyo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd. of Japan
raised $5 million. By using the complementary financing
mechanism, the Bank was able to help its borrowers obtain
commercial financing at improved market terms and, at the
same time, introduce new financing opportunities to commercial banks.

Equity investments

Initial efforts during the year were devoted mainly to the
establishment of policies and procedures and to reaching
agreements with the DMCs on the framework for the Bank's
equity investment activities in their respective countries. Five DMCs have already indicated their interest in the
Bank's equity investments. The Equity Unit also received initial inquiries from over 50 private enterprises, ten of which
were selected for further processing and investigation.

The Bank’s strategy has been to focus attention on the
development finance institution (DFl) sector. Two investments were approved during the year: the Bank will invest Won 750 million (about $0.96 million) in the share capital
of Korea Development Investment Corporation, a private venture capital company with a pioneering role in the provision
of scarce risk capital to technology-intensive smal! and
medium-sized enterprises; the Bank also approved a line of
equity in the amount of $2 million to Bankers Equity Ltd., a
DF) operating in Pakistan. The equity line will facilitate the
Bank’s investment in private small and medium-sized industrial enterprises. In making and supervising these inyestments, the Bank will be assisted by the DFI which will
also be providing parallel financing to the enterprises.

It is expected that equity operations will expand in the
coming year as more agreements are forged with the different
DMCs and the prospects for such investments grow with improved economic conditions in the DMCs (see page 60).

eaoeBenefits to the Poor

The Bank in 1983 continued its multi-faceted approach to
the alleviation of poverty in its DMCs. {i raised the overall
level of lending from concessional resources — the Asian
Development Fund (ADF) — and concentrated this lending
in the poorer borrowing nations. The Bank also helped to
identify, formulate and finance projects in those sectors
which contribute directly to raising the incomes and improving the quality of tife of the poor. The sectoral focus
remained primarily on assistance to agriculture and rural
development, but there were significant increases in lending
for health and population, education, and water supply and
sanitation.

Bank lending from ADF resources in 1983 increased sharply to $703.4 million, almost 29 per cent higher in nominal
terms than in 1982. In 1983, about 96 per cent of ADF loans
went to the low-income DMCs with a per capita gross nationa! product (GNP) in 1981 of less than $350. The largest
recipients were Bangladesh ($273.5 million), Pakistan ($185.3
million), Nepal ($82.7 million) and Burma ($79.6 million). A
iotal of $12.6 miilion went to the Group A (lower-income)
South Pacific countries and one ADF loan of $15 million was
made to Papua New Guinea, the only Group B (middieincome) country to receive ADF funds.

The Bank seeks to help alleviate poverty by allocating a
large portion of its total resources, both OCR and ADF, for
projects tn rural areas. !n 4983, the Bank provided $306.5
miilion in ADF toans for agricultural and rural development
projects, representing about 43.6 per cent of the year’s total
ADF tending. In addition, $341.9 million was allocated from
OCR for agricultural and rural development projects, conStituting about 29 per cent of the year’s total OCR lending.

The projects financed by these foans were generally
located in low-income countries — Bangladesh, Burma,
Nepal and Vanuatu — and in the more economicaily
depressed regions of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea,
Philippines, Solomon Islands and Thailand. They were also
fabor-intensive and designed to utilize technologies appropriate to those countries and regions.

In the area of agricultural production, the Bank approved
loans for irrigation, crop intensification, agricultural credit,
and aquaculture and livestock development. These projects
are designed to salve the perennial probléms of low productivity and low incomes in rural areas. The irrigation projects
approved in 1983 will reduce farmers’ vulnerability to unfavorable weather; consequently, their incomes wiil fluctuate
less drastically year-to-year. These projects will also improve
farmers’ regulation of their water supplies, enabling the
utilization of new seed varieties which need amore controlled
growing environment. This will permit double or triple cropPing, thereby increasing the productivity of the land.

Many of Asia's poor rely heavily on local fisheries for food
and incomes, In recent years, some DMCs have begun to
teorient fishery development policies in order to emphasize
fish production by aquaculture. The Bank assisted in this
Process in 1983 by approving two loans, one in the
Phitippines and one in Sri Lanka, for fisheries projects which
4r@. primarily designed to increase the production of fish by
Smail-scale fish culture. These projects together will provide
additional employment opportunities for over 6,000 people
and are expected to benefit over 250,000 people through the
expansion of fish supplies available for domestic
Consumption.

Bank support for forest management and development —
the Hill Forest Development Project in Nepal, which was approved in 1983, is a good example — can also directly benefit
the poor. Fuetwood is the most important energy source of
the rural poor. Proper management of forest resources is
needed, therefore, to ensure future supplies of wood and to
avoid the environmental degradation which can result from
over-exploitation.

The provision of better health and educational facilities
needed by low-income groups is another important area of
Bank assistance to the poor. In 1983, the Bank approved
loans for nine social infrastructure projects — water supply
and urban development as well as health and education
facilities — amounting to $421.4 million compared with
$173.5 million in 1982

The Agricultural Education Project in Indonesia will
establish new agricultural secondary schools and
polytechnics in the outer islands where there is a need for
such education. Similarly, the Second Vocational Education
Project in Malaysia will establish vocational schools
throughout the country. Both of these projects will give access to educational opportunities to the poorer rural communities located in isolated parts of Indonesia and Malaysia.

The Bank’s efforts to alleviate poverty have been mainly
focused on rural areas where the vast majority of the poor
live. The Bank has also been financing projects which are
designed to help the urban poor. In 1983, for instance, theBank approved financing for three projects which seek to improve fiving conditions in urban areas and smali towns in
Indonesia and Republic of Korea. The Small Towns Urban
Development Project in Indonesia will directly benefit about
300,000 residents of low-income settlements in several smail
and medium-sized towns through flood control, more effective collection and disposal of solid waste and expansion
of fow-Income housing. In the Republic of Korea, improvement io the water supply in several low-income areas Is the
main objective of the Bank-financed Smali Towns Water
Supply Sector Project, while the Second Sewage Treatment
Project will upgrade sanitation facilitles in areas populated
by poor people.

Bank foans {n other sectors in 1983 will also bring signlficant benefits to the poor. The Vientiane Piain Rural Electrification (Phase Il) Project in Lao POR, for example, will extend the benefits of the Nam Ngum Hydropower Project by
providing electricity for 61 villages. Similarly, the poor will
be the main beneticiartes of road construction and improve.
ment projects in Burma, Lao PDR, Nepal and Papua New
Guinea. These projects will provide access to numerous rural
areas, create new outlets for smallholder farm produce and
allow greater mobility for the people living in the project
areas.

In 4983, the Bank also reviewed and revised, as necessary,
its operational policies which would facilitate its !ending for
projects which benefit the poor (see pages 57-80).

Support for Private Sector
Activities in DMCs

The private sector has a significant rote to play in
economic development and particularly so in the development of those DMCs in which Government encourages
private Initiative. It also contributes substantially to the
growth of national income, investment, employment and export earnings as well as the transfer of technology.

Recognizing these factors, the Bank has endeavored to
promote and assist the private sector, mainly through the
provision of credit tines to development finance institutions
(DF ls) for meeting the financial requirements of small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs} which are not large enough
to warrant direct Bank supervision.

During 1983, the Bank extended credit lines to DFIs in
Republic of Korea, Pakistan, Thailand and Tonga totatling
$206 million. At the end of December 1983, the Bank had extended 74 credit iInes amounting to $1.86 billion to 29 DFis
in 18 DMCs. These oredit lines had been committed to the
extent of $1.2 bilfion and utilized (disbursed) to the extent
of $1 billion for assisting nearly 9,100 widely dispersed SMEs,
approximately 95 per cent of which are in the private sector. More than three-fourths of the subioans have been made
to manufacturing enterprises. The Bank has also provided
technical assistance for the establishment of DFis in some
smaiter DMCs and for Institution building, Including staff
training, of severai other DFis.

In addiilon to such assistance to industrial DFis, private
enterprises In the agro-Industry subsector in Bangladesh wit!
benefit from a $40 million credit line to the Bangladesh Krishi
Bank approved in 1983. Over 2,900 new and existing enterprises engaged In agro-processing, marketing, storage and
transport are expected to benefit from the loan, leading to
a total additional investment of $80 million and the creation
of 8,000 new employment opportunities in rural areas.

in a new catalytic role aimed at promoting the flow of additional capital, both domestic and foreign, to the private sector, the Bank commenced equity investment operations in
1983. it is hoped these operations will hetp fill investment
gaps in private enterprises and assist in bringing together
domestic and foreign investors in joint ventures. The Bank
approved two equity investments during the year, one each
in Republic of Korea and Pakistan (see pages 29 and 60).

The Bank also helped promote private sector investment
in the minerals subsector during 1983 through its geological
and mineral survey projects in Thailand and Indonesia. Both
are designed to provide comprehensive information
necessary for mineral resources development and will help
reduce the risk factor for would-be inyestors. The latter additionally alms at upgrading and strengthening facilities and
technical personnel at the four principal directorates responsible for geological survey and mineral exploration in
Indonesia.

Technical assistance to the Philippines to improve the
pianning and management of industrial estates and export
processing zones will also help in the formulation of a
realistic master plan for industrial support facilities to be
developed outside Metropolitan Manila.

In 1983, the Bank also approved a regional technical
assistance grant for a Study of Capital Markets in Selected
DMCs to assess the problems and prospects of capital
markets and identify promising areas for Bank assistance
(see page 55).ea

(left) at a river crossing on the Hetauda-Narayangarh Road
in Nepal. Bank financing helped construct four major
bridges and improve 80 km. of this trunk road which links
Kathmandu with important development areas,

Bank operations in the agriculture and rural development
sector benefit millions of small farmers and rural commercial operators — the region's largest single group of private
entrepreneurs, Bank-financed projects for irrigation, crop intensification, rural development, fisheries, livestock and
agricultural credit have helped small-scale agricultural entrepreneurs to increase production, productivity and income. For example, over 1,800 fish pond operators will be

_ directly assisted in the Philippines under an Aquaculture

Development Project, while a similar project in Sri Lanka will
establish the necessary support facilities for commercial production of shrimp for export and encourage the private sector to invest in brackishwater ponds.

Bank assistance for urban development and housing projecis has also often indirectly helped private sector activities. In the Small Towns Urban Development Sector Project in Indonesia, for example, Bank finahcing covers a subproject for infrastructure improvement in public markets quite
apart from urban-related infrastructure development in
selected towns in Central Java. A regional Seminar on
Financing of Low-Income Housing, organized by the Bank
in February 1983, envisaged a significant role for the private
sector in tackling the severe housing shortages, particularly for middle to high-income housing, in some DMCs.

The Bank has also helped meet the requirement of trained
Manpower for private sector endeavors in industry,
agriculture and other sectors through its support for vocational education projects. Bank assistance for infrastructure
projects such as power generation and distrioution, water
Supply and roads has also helped increase investments in
and the productivity of the private sector.

Such diversified Bank support for private sector initiatives
and endeavors is expected to be further strengthened in the
future. The extension of loans without guarantee by the
Government of the recipient DMC and the use of the Bank's
Quérantee operations are some of the additional measures
Currently under consideration by the Bank.

  

Women in Bank-Assisted Activities

Being aware of the special needs of women and the important role they play in socio-economic development. the
Bank has assisted projects which have supported these considerations. Among the more recent Bank-financed projects,
the Northwest Rural Development Project in Bangladesh, for
instance, involved the promotion of productive enterprises
by groups which included women’s cooperatives. In the
Education sector, the Bank-supported Vocational Education
Project in Indonesia involved the upgrading of vocational
schools which teach subjects of special interest to women.
The Bank will continue to review its overall approach to the
evolving role of women in development.

Training Activities

The upgrading of human resources and institutional
capabilities is an important element in the economic development efforts of the DMCs. Recognizing that the transfer of
knowledge and skills and the creation and maintenance of
effective institutions fs vital for self-sustained growth, the
Bank has tecently increased its lending and technical
assistance activities for training programs.

These training activities fa{l into four main categories:
project-related training activities offered under Bank loans;
training to support institution building under advisory and
operational technical assistance grants; general training activities offered on a regional or national basis through
regional technical assistance grants; and on-the-job training in the Bank itself for seconded DMC officials.

During 1983, several Bank loans included training components or overseas training and fellowships for the staff
of executing agencies. Under the Mineral Resources
Development Project in Thailand, for example, for which the
Bank approved a $33 million loan, a total of about 110 manyears of long-term (master and doctorate degree courses) and
short-term (special skill and technique-oriented courses)
training programs will be provided for nearly 70 personne!
of the Department of Mineral Resources.

Furthermore, 43 man-months of feliowships in hospital
management were included in the Rangoon General Hospital
Project in Burma and 560 man-months of staff fellowships
for teacher training in the Second Vocational Education Project in Malaysia. In indonesia, over nine man-years of staff
fellowship programs, costing about $1.2 million, were
included in the Agricultural Education Project.

During the year, the Bank approved technical assistance
forinstitution building in several OMCs. in Bangladesh, for
example, a UNDP-financed technical assistance grant of $1.5
million, which the Bank will administer as Executing Agency, will finance an assessment of two major development
finance institutions, Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha and
Bangladesh Shilpa Bank, to ensure that the country maintains viable and effective institutions for promoting and
financing industrial projects with high development impact.

During 1983, the Bank approved a number of technical
assistance grants for general training activities offered on
a regional or national basis (see table on page 71).

The Bank also provided on-the-job training under its
secondment program to three officials from DMCs for periods
ranging from six months to one year and short-term
familiarization or exposure to the Bank's activities to three
officials from DMCs under ifs attachment program. —

33Environmental Activities

During 1983, the Bank continued to assist DMCs to pursue sustained development through effective management
and utilization of environmental and natural resources. Its
efforts in this direction were reflected in project planning and
design, increased assistance to DMCs in strengthening their
environmenta! and natural resources planning and management capabilities and the promotion of environmental projects as such.

In addition to standard environmental review at the appraisal stage, reviews have also been Increasingly conducted
at earlier stages of the project cycle — project identification and preparation and fact-finding — while environmental concerns have also been taken into account in the
preparation of Country Situation and Program Papers. The
Bank recognizes that environmental review at the project
feasibility or formulation stage is the most effective way to
avoid conceptual and design errors which may prove difficult
or cosily to rectify later in the project cycle.

{n addition to project-by-project contact and informal
discussions on environmental aspects between the Bank’s
Environment Unit and project staff, biannual seminars are
held on environmental and natura! resources planning and
management. When appropriate, brief presentations on environmental topics have also been included in seminars on
other subjects.

Sectoral Review

Agriculture and Agro-industry

The Agriculture and Agro-Industry sector remained an area
of top priority among the DMCs and continued to receive the
largest share of Bank lending in 1983. Lending to this sector (which covers irrigation and rural development, fisheries,
livestock, agricultural! credit and support services, forestry,
fertilizer and agro-processing) amounted to $648.4 miilion
(34.2 per cent of overall lending}, an Increase of 4.4 per cent
over $621.3 million in 1982. The increase would have been
larger but for the deferment to 1984, at the request of the
Governments concerned, of two major loans (one each in
Pakistan and Thailand) totalling $88 million which had
already been appraised.

In 1983, however, the Bank’s technical assistance in this
sector expanded significantly, particularly for activities such
as agricultural crop research and food supply and demand
studies which have a regional! impact and for project preparation, This higher level of activity is expected to result in
substantial increases in tending in.subsequent years, During the year, more than 50 per cent of the Bank’s technical
assistance went to agriculture and agro-industrial activities,
and total technical assistance to this sector funded from the
Bank and other sources amounted to $9.9 million for 34 projects compared with $8 million for 28 projects in 1982.

This high level of Bank lending to the sector reflects the
important role that agriculture plays in the economies of its
DMCs and the need for a continued stream of investments
to promote agricultural output. in most DMCs, agriculture
contributes something between 30 and 70 per cent of gross
national product (GNP), and the proportion of the national
labor force employed in agriculture ranges between 50 and
90 per cent. Over one-third of the value of DMC exports is
accounted for by agricultural commodities, including those
In processed form, and in many DMCs the share is over onehalf.

The Bank’s efforts are mainly almed at Increasing food production and the overall productivity of the sector. This Is to
be achieved through fish production, livestock development
and the production of agricultural crops by means of improvements to Irrigation and other Infrastructure, the supply of agricultural Inputs, and providing greater access to
markets and storage faclllties. Emphasis Is also piaced on
strengthening implementation and expanding institutional
capacity for future development through agricultural training and extension, development of rural service centers and
consultant services.

In pursuit of its development objectives, and in order to
enhance operational efficiency, the Bank in 1983 made extensive use of new methods of lending. It extended three program loans to enhance utilization of production potential
created by past investments through crop intensification programs. Two sector loans were also approved to accelerate
and improve implementation of irrigation development and
rehabilitation. In 1983, for the first time, four countries
received Special Assistance toans, of which the majority of
components were In the Agricufture sector (see page 59).

Total Bank lending to this sector as of the end of 1983
amounted to $4,075.7 million for 213 projects, while technical
assistance amounted to $68.7 million for 274 projects. In
terms of overail Bank lending, the Agriculture and Agroindustry sector received a littie over one-third (34.2 per cent)
of total loans during 1983 compared with 35.9 per cent in
1982.

{rrigation and Rural Development: Bank-assisted irrigation and rural development projects in 1983 were generally
designed to take into account the development priorities of
DMCs and help increase food production, generate
agricultural employment, conserve foreign exchange and
alleviate poverty.

The Bank continued to emphasize the importance of small
and medlum-scale schemes which involve simple technology,
utllize labor-intensive methods and generate maximum
benefits with minimal investment in a relatively short
period. In view of this, the Bank focused its attention on pro|acts involving rehabilltation of existing facilitles and improvements to water management practices. For example,
under the Ganges-Kobadak Irrigation Rehabilitation Project
in Bangladesh, for which the Bank provided a $37 million concesslonaf loan, an existing irrigation system currently serving 125,000 ha. will be rehabllitated and upgraded, directly
benefitting 114,000 farm familles and generating 66,000 manyears of incremental farm labor annually. In Indonesia, a Second irrigation Sector toan for $85 milllon was approved for
a Project, to be co-financed by IFAD, which will help
rehabllitate and improve existing irrigation systems covering about 45,000 ha. On completion, it will directly benefit
84,500 low-income farm families and generate about 66,000
man-years of empioyment.

Irrigation projects approved during the year in the
Philippines and indonesia were designed to extend areas
under reliable water control. The Irrigation Sector Project in
the Philippines, for which the Bank approved a ioan of $67.4
million, involves construction of new irrigation facitities on
about 27,200 ha. of land and rehabilitation and improvement
of 10,400 ha. of existing irrigation systems. Under the Second Irrigation Package Project in Indonesia, for which a $52
milllon toan was approved, about 17,000 ha. of land will be
provided with assured irrigation water.

In support of Papua New Guinea’s objective of increasing the rate of growth in the Agriculture sector, the Bank approved a $15 million joan for the Cape Rodney Smallhoider
Development Project. This involves the rehabilitation and expansion of existing smallholder settlement schemes and the
development of new land for growing rubber. It also includes
the provision of agricultural support and community services.

A Project Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation (PBME) element was built into most of the irrigation and rural development projects to ensure that benefits from these projects are
actually achieved. Similarly, to avoid or minimize any environmental disturbance which may be caused by develop

in 1983, the Bank approved eight loans amounting to $264.8
million in this subsector. This accounted for almost 41 per
cent of the Bank's total lending for Agriculture and Agroindustry during the year and raised cumulative lending to the
subsector to $2,081.6 million.

Fisheries: During 1983, the Bank continued to be an important source of financing for fisheries development projects. As in the past, new projects focused on expanding
high-protein fish supplies for domestic consumption, increasing foreign exchange earnings through fishery product exports and creating employment opportunities. Bank support
for marine fisheries and aquaculture has focused on providing assistance designed to alleviate poverty and raise the
incomes of the poor. A secondary but very important benefit
being derived from Bank-assisted fisheries projects is the
improvement in nuttition which comes from the increased
Production of low-priced fish.

The Bank approved two loans amounting to $39.1 million
for aquaculture projects in the Philippines and Sri Lanka in

as well as production for export.

As of the end of 1983, the Bank had approved 34 loans
amounting to $498 million for marine and inland fisheries.

Livestock: The Bank's assistance to this subsector continued to expand during 1983 through financing of $2.6 million
for the livestock component of the Agricultural Development
Project in Solomon Islands. As of the end of the year, 12
foans amounting to $135 million had been approved for
livestock projects. They encompass almost all aspects of
livestock development, including the strengthening of
livestock organization, government and industry support services, but focus principally on small farmer livestock
development.

Forestry: The Bank recognizes the role of forestry in
stabilizing vital watersheds for sustained agricultural production, in supplying raw material for wood-based industries and
in improving the environment and the quality of life in rural
areas, The need for the Bank to expand operations in the
forestry subsector has become increasingly urgent in view

3738

of the diminishing supply of traditional woodfuels and
widespread deforestation in rural Asia,

In 1983, Bank-assisted projects in the forestry subsector
were designed to have'a beneficial impact on rural development and ecosystems. The Hili Forest Development Project
in Nepal, for whlch the Bank approved a concessional joan
of $16.7 milllon, mainly involves the management of existing
forests and the replanting of grassiands with a view to increasing the production of fuelwood, leaf and grass fodder
which will be made available to poor rural communtties under
a benefit-sharing scheme. The Forestry Development Project
in the Philippines, for whith the Bank approved a $34 million
toan, is designed to reforest 10,700 ha. of open public forest
land for the production of fuelwood, pulpwood and timber,
reforest a further 1,300 ha. for erosion contro! and develop
community forestry by creating agroforestry farms for the
productlon of fuelwood, timber, tree crops and fodder needed by the focal community.

As of the end of 1983, the Bank had provided nine loans
amounting to $136.4 million to the forestry subsector.

Agricultural Support Services: (n 1983, the Bank continued to provide financing for agricultural support services
(including research, extension, credit, marketing and storage)
in order to improve agricultusal production and the standard
of living ot small farmers. The Bank recognizes that an increased and reliable supply of chemical fertilizer is essential for raising agricultural production in general and that of
foodgrains in particular.

In 1983, the Bank approved two loans for agricultural credit
amouniing to $90 million. A concessional loan of $40 million
for the Bangladesh Krishl Sank {s aimed at providing flnancial support to enterprises involved in the processing,
preserving and marketing of various perishable crops and
support for storage facllities for grain, agricultural inputs and
transportation. The Agricultural Credit Project in Thailand,
for which the Bank approved a $50 million loan, will support
Government efforts to improve the efficiency of agricultural
production, accelerate the process of agricultural intensification ane promote crop diversification. Crop intensification
program loans totalling $93 million were extended to

and Solomon Islands ($5.15 million). In addition, storage
capacity for some 400,000 mt. of grains and ancillary facilities
and services will be financed by the $41.9 million loan for
the Foodgrain Storage Project in Pakistan.

As of the end of 1983, the Bank had provided 32 loans totalling $574.2 million for agricultural support services, including
$284.5 million for agricultural credit projects and $154.7

_million for program loans in the agriculture and irrigation

sector.

Energy

The Energy sector remained the second largest sector in
Bank lending operations although its share fell from about
30 per cent in 1982 to 24 per cent in 1983. During the year,

nine loans amounting to $451 million were approved for eight
energy projects. In addition, 22 technical assistance grants
totalling $4.9 million, including six for regional energy projects, were also provided. While the major emphasis was
placed on the development of indigenous energy resources,
improvements to quality and reliability of power supply, including operational efficiency, continued to receive attention.

The seven Bank-financed power projects for which eight
loans were approved in 1983 will contribute to the development of indigenous resources such as hydropower and
geothermal power resources in Indonesia, fuel savings in
Pakistan through utilization of waste heat, and the optimum
use of geothermal resources in the Philippines and
hydropower resources in Lao PDR for rural electrification.
Two of the loans will be primarily for the development of
transmission and distribution facilities in Bangladesh and
Nepal. A technical assistance loan was also approved for
comprehensive feasibility and engineering studies for thermal plants needed in Sri Lanka.

growth.

sources continued in 1983 with a loan to Pakistan for the expansion of gas purification and compression facilities. This
will help increase the availability of natural gas for industrial,
commercial and residential purposes. This loan was also the
first to have commercial co-financing under the recently introduced complementary financing scheme.

During 1983, a total of 16 country-specific technical
assistance projects were approved, amounting to $3.6 million,
These included projects for national energy planning and inStitution building, energy conservation and development of
indigenous energy sources. In addition, six regional Energy
sector technical assistance grants amounting to $1.3 million
were approved, including the ASEAN Coal Development

Study, Energy Demand Management Strategies Review and
Electric Power Utilities Data Book.

The Energy Planning Unit became fully operational and
made significant progress in the development of Energy sector activities in the DMCs. A number of technical assistance
projects for overall energy planning and policy analysis were
formulated and implemented during the year. Initially, a
number of loan projects will be identified and evaluated
through intersectoral energy planning technical assistance
projects which were either approved or completed during
4983. One major energy planning project, funded jointly by
UNDP and the Bank, commenced in Bangladesh In August
1983 and is due for completion in early 1985. Under this project, assistance will be provided to the Government of
Bangladesh in developing and maintaining energy planning
capabilities as well as providing energy development plans
which can form part of both the Government's and the Bank's
investment planning. Similarly, energy planning support was
also provided to Thailand by way of a follow-up to its Energy
Master Plan, from which several potential projects are now
emerging.

A number of studies in the Energy sector were either initiated or completed during the year. These were aimed at
obtaining improved understanding of some of the important
issues and ongoing programs in the Energy sectors of the
OMCs. It was intended that such assessments would help
identify more efficient policies, as well as provide guidance
for the identification and preparation of more effective projects and programs. A Regiona! Rural Electrification Survey,
a study of Refinery Rationalization Needs, and Energy
Assessments (together with the World Bank) for Fiji and
Solomon Islands were completed during the year. Additionaily, work was initiated during the year on the Review of Energy
Demand Management of DMCs, Bagasse Utilization for
Energy Development, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Utilization
and Marketing Development.

Continuing work initiated in 1983, the Bank expects to
develop in the coming years detailed lending strategies in
the Energy sector in each DMC from country and regionai
energy reviews. These are expected to lead to the identification of new energy projects. Such reviews, by providing the
Bank with more information and focusing on the problems
and potentials of the Energy sector, will enable the Bank io
be of greater assistance to DMCs in its fending operations.

During the year, two seminars were sponsored by the Bank
for officials of power utilities: the South Asia and Southeast
Asia and Pacific Regional Energy/Power Projects Course and
the Regional Program on Power Utility Accounting and
Management !nformation System, Both courses were aimed
at further developing the technical, financial and managerial
skills of power utility staff.

As of the end of 1983, the Bank had provided 133 loans
amounting to $3,408 million in the Energy sector. This accounted for about 25 per cent of total Bank lending.

Industry and Non-Fuel Minerals

The majority of the Bank’s DMCs continue to assign high
priority to industrialization as a strategy for achieving
balanced and accelerated socio-economic development. improvements in balance of payments through import substitution and/or export diversification, higher employment generation, more equitable income distribution and a wider dispersal of the ownership of ihe means of production are amongthe benefits sought by DMCs from industrialization.
The Bank’s approach in this sector has been to support

programs and projects which are aimed at helping DMCs ©

develop their industrial capacity and industrial infrastructure.
Consistent with this approach, the Bank has helped its DMCs
to industrialize by direct lending for large-scale industries
and by indirect lending through DFis for small and mediumscale industries, it has also extended financial and technical
assistance forthe establishment, expansion and upgrading
of industrial research and management training institutes
which help small and medium-scale industries achieve
greater operational efficiency, higher productivity, better
quality standards and improved technology.

In addition, the Bank has helped promote the development
of industrial estates, a notable example of which is the Small
industries Center in Tonga.

The development of non-fuel mineral resources both for
export and domestic consumption can contribute significantly towards increased foreign exchange earnings and
domestic revenues in some DMCs and thereby help to improve balance of payments ahd to stimulate economic activity in other sectors. In view of this, the Bank has continued
to promote mineral resource development activities in DMCs
which are known to have significant amounts of untapped
mineral reserves. Systematic geological, geophysical and
geochemical surveys to generate the essential data on location, quantity, quality and mineability of mineral ore deposits
which are required to facilitate the promotion of mineral
resource development in DMCs are of importance in this context. Bank activities in this sector in 1983, therefore, focused
on the development and upgrading of national institutional
capabilities and facilities for conducting minerai resource
surveys and exploration programs,

In 1983, the Bank approved a supplementary loan of $10
million for the completion of the Hetauda Cement Project
in Nepal and two loans amounting to $85 million for a
” Geological and Mineral Survey Project in Indonesia and a
Mineral Resources Development Project in Thailand. As of
the.end of 1983, the Bank had made 27 loans amounting to
$486.4 million for 24 projects in the Industry and Non-Fuet
Minerals sector in ten DMCs.

The Bank also approved technical assistance amounting
to $400,006 for a Policy and Institutional Review of Planning
and Management of Industrial Estates and Export Processing Zones in the Philippines, thus bringing cumulative
technical assistance in this sector to 23 technical assistance
grants amounting to $4.2 million for 22 projects in nine DMCs,
including two regional studies.

Development Banks

During the year, the Bank increased the flow of its
assistance to small and medium-scale enterprises in DMCs,
Most of which are in the private sector. As in the past, the
Bank continued to use DFls as channels for its assistance
to those enterprises whose financing requirements were too
Small to warrant direct Bank support.

While serving this basic objective, Bank credit lines to DFIs
also significantly support the DFls themselves by enabling
them to enlarge and diversify their portfolios. Moreover, Bank
operations in this area have also enabled it to play an imPortant role in the establishment of new DFls in several
DMCs. it has also actively participated in the strengthening
Of existing DFis, helping turn them into better-managed and

financially stronger institutions which can fulfill their financial intermediation and promotional responsibilities more effectively and efficiently. To facilitate this institution-building
process, the Bank has also provided technical assistance
grants to DFls, either together with loans or separately. These
grants have mainly been utilized for engaging experts who
can give operational or organizational advice and guidance,
and for upgrading staff skills.

During the year, the Bank approved credit lines totailing
$206 million to six DFis, all for meeting the foreign exchange
requirements of development projects. It extended a fifth loan
to Korea Long Term Credit Bank {KLB} in an amount of $70
million and a sixth loan, of $25 million, to the Industriat
Finance Corporation of Thailand (FCT). Both credits were
for financing private enterprises. The Bank has assisted the
KLB to secure commercial co-financing of $43 million. The
credit line to [FCT will be co-financed by syndicated commercial loans totalling $50 million.

Tonga Development Bank (TDB) received a second Bank
credit line, for $1 million, during 1983 for assisting productive enterprises in the agricultural, manufacturing and other
sectors. The credit line was supplemented by a $1 million
loan from [FAD which will be administered by the Bank and
utilized for financing agricultural development projects. The
Bank loan was combined with a technical assistance grant
of $135,000.

{n 1983, the Bank extended a $100,000 technical assistance
grant to Fiji Development Bank for redefining its role and
functions and developing its future operational strategy. The
Bank also assumed responsibitity for the administration, in
association with the International Development Association,
ofa $1.5 million technical assistance grant from the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for carrying out a
comprehensive assessment of the institutional aspects and
the future role of two Bank-associated DFls in Bangladesh,
namely, Bangladesh Shilpa Bank and Bangladesh Shilpa Rin
Sangstha.

Marking a departure from its past practice of extending
separate credit lines to individual DFls, the Bank in 1983 approved a composite credit line of $110 million — its largest
so farin this sector — for contemporaneous utilization by
three DFls in Pakistan, namely, National Development
Finance Corporation, Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation Lid. and Bankers Equity Lid, The proceeds
of the foan will be relent mainly to private industrial enterprises. This new lending technique wil! enable the Bank to
adopt a systematic and consistent approach to industrial
credit problems in the country while at the same time maintaining direct operational relationships with the participating
DFis.

The five loans’ approved during the year raised the Bank's
cumulative lending to the Development Banks sector, as of
the end of 1983, to $1,664.6 million through 74 credit fines.
This represented 12.4 per cent of total Bank lending.

Transport and Communications

During 1983, the Bank made four loans to the Transport
and Communications sector compared with six loans in 1982
and two loans in 1981. It also approved a Multiproject loan
in which transport and communications components ac
 

_ + Including a loan of $1 million approved for Tonga Development Bank as part

of a Multiproject loan.

4442

counted for nearly 80 per cent of the loan amount.

The total amount of lending to this sector, however, fell
sharply from $257.4 mitlion in 1982 to $65.5 million in 1983.
The decrease is mainly a reflection of the smaller loan
amounts to the recipient countries, most of which (Burma,
Lao PDR, Nepal, and, in the case of the Multiproject Joan,
Bhutan) are smailer, iower-income DMCs.

The loan to Burma, the Bank’s first in the road subsector
of that country, will help upgrade a major 254-km. national’
road in the Upper Irrawaddy Delta area which will support
agricultural development programs. The foan to Lao PDR, the
first In the Transport sector of that country, will help
rehabliitate and improve $3 km. of a secondary road and 90
km. of feeder roads In the Vientiane Plaln and thereby assist
in the realization of the area’s full development potential. A
Bank-assisted Project in Papua New Guinea for the improvement of 74 km. of national roads will accelerate development
of an Important agricultural area and result In rellable lowercost transportation. Improvements to 260 km. of feeder roads
in the Eastern and Far Western regions of Nepal will help
to lower transportatlon costs and improve access to areas
with development potential. The Multiproject loan to Bhutan
wilt, among other things, enable the construction of 90 km.
of new roads and 24 suspension bridges, thereby providing
access to remote areas and improving communications.

The Bank approved five technical assistance projects in
this sector in 1983. They will finance feasibility studies of
toad projects in Nepal and Solomon Islands, help prepare
projects designed to improve and expand shipyards in Fill
and Kiribat! and examine the technical viability and fuel
saving potential of sall motor propulsion in Fijl. During the
year, a technical assistance proposal was finalized for a
survey of intermodal transport in Bangladesh and for the tormulation of a coordinated sector plan and program for
transport Investments in that country. In addition, an advisory
and operatlonai technical assistance to Bhutan will assist
the Government in preparing subprojects under the Mult!
project approved during the year.

A regional Study of the Impact of the Energy Situation on
Transport Development, carried out under technical
assistance approved in 1982, was completed in 1983. The
Study findings, which were reviewed by an advisory group
of transport and energy experts from within and outside the
region, wiil be taken into account by the Bank in its future
operations in this sector.

As of the end of 1983, the Bank had made 100 loans
amounting to $1,676.7 milflon for 91 projects in the Transport
and Communications sector. Roads received the major share
{60.1 per cent}, followed by ports (29 per cent), airports (5.5
per cent), railways (2.8 per cent) and telecommunications (2.6
per cent). Cumulatively, the share of lending to the sector
as a proportion of total Bank jending was 12.5 per cent.

Water Supply and Sanitation

Few, if any, essential pubtic services contribute as much
to improving the health and living standards of the poor as
safe, piped water and the efficient, sanitary disposal of
human waste. in fact, the provision of these two fundamental
services to everyone by the end of the current decade was
the goal of the United Nations when it declared the period
1981-80 as the International Drinking Water Supply and
Sanitation Decade,

in earlier years, Bank lending activities in this sector mainly
assisted in the expansion of water supply and sewerage
systems in fast-growing towns and cities. In more recent
years, the Bank has also increasingly supported projects involving water supply systems in small provincial towns and
rural areas in order to promote social equity and extend the
benefits of development to the rural poor or less privileged
sections of the population. This widened scope of Bank activity is evident in Its four project toans, amounting to $186.6
million, and four technical assistance projects approved In
1983.

A loan for a Project In Kedah state, one of the less
developed regions in Mataysia to which the Government is
giving considerable attention, wil! increase the capacity of
the Sungei Petani water supply system by nearly 200 per cent
to meet the demand projected for a population of 250,000
people up to 1995. Apart from the supply of safe water, direct
financial benefits are expected as the Project wil! include
measures for a substantial reduction in teakages and illegal
connections. Institutional, commercial and industrial needs
of the Project area will also be catered for. The Philippines
will benefit from a loan of $39.3 million for a Project designed
essentially to reduce the amount of unaccounted-for water
through the rehabilitation of the distribution system In 56
target zones located in six districts of Manila. itis estimated
that about 7.5 million consumers of treated water in
Metropolitan Manila will benefit from the Project which also
Includes operational and Institutional support and training.

A Project In the Repubiic of Korea, for whlch the Bank approved a $60 mifllon ioan, will provide facilities for the
abstractlon, treatment and distribution of safe water for
about 21 small communities with populations ranging from
20,000 to 118,000 tn various parts of the country. Another
loan, of $62.8 million, to the Republic of Korea will finance
the first-stage Implementation of a master plan covering the
sewerage and sanitation factilty requirements of the cities
of Ulsan, Masan and Changwon up to the year 2000.

A significant feature of the Bank's téchnical assistance
activities in this sector in 1983 was the development of rural
and underpriviteged areas. For example, about 47 smail rural
communities in Nepal will benefit from a Project to be
prepared under a technical assistance grant. The Bank will
also execute a Study, financed by UNDP, to prepare a Project in Bangladesh which will provide safe water and adequate
sanitation in selected district towns whose total populations
are expected to increase from 650,000 to 4.4 miltion by
41980. Another study approved during the year will help formulate the Rangoon Water Distribution Project in Burma,
complementing an earlier Bank-financed water supply project for Rangoon where the population Is expected to be approaching two mitlion by 1991. Preparation of a Project to
rehabilitate and augment water supply facilities and to construct low-cost sanitation systems in six important centers
in Bhutan will be undertaken under another technicai
assistance grant. In addition, the Bank provided assistance
for a workshop, to be held in early 1984, which will help DMCs
improve their capabilities for preparing water supply projects
through the introduction of computerized techniques for planning and designing smal! towns and rural water supply
systems.

As of the end of 1983, total Bank lending to the Water Supply and Sanitation sector amounted to $1,074 million covering 48 projects in 44 countries, while technical assistance
amounted to $7.1 miilion for 36 projects.r

Urban Development

In the Urban Development sector, the Bank’s approach has
been to support programs which are intended to improve
directly the living environment for low-income households
and which promote more efficient urban growth. In the past,
the Bank has assisted the development of secondary cities,
new towns and growth centers serving predominantly rural!
hinterlands. Bank projects have frequently included the provision of essential services to low-income groups and have
been designed to take a comprehensive approach, emphasizing the importance of basic services and the integration of
urban development and housing activities. The Bank has
also devoted attention to institutional development, particulariy by strengthening policies and technical and financial competence.

During the year, the Bank approved a sector loan of $36.7
million for the Small Towns Urban Development Project in
indonesia. This Project is designed to improve the living conditions of residents in 38 small and medium-sized towns in

SEWERAGE pipes being laid in Bandung, Indonesia. The
Bandung Urban Development Project, for which the Bank
approved 2 $32.3 million loan, was designed to meet priority housing and sanitation needs. The Bank also provided
$150,000 in technical assistance for a feasibility study of a
second-phase project,

 

Central Java Province by providing essential and inexpensive services in low-income areas and by improving solid
waste management and drainage systems. The water supply and distribution systems of 17 of the 38 towns will be
extended, while five towns will benefit through the developmeni of low-income housing estates. The Project also provides for studies and training programs aimed at strengthening the institutions directly concerned — technical agencies
of the central Government and municipal administrations of
the Project towns — in order to facilitate the development
and implementation of future programs in the Province. Overall, about 1.5 million people are expected to
benefit from the Project, the majority in the lower-income
group.

Atechnical assistance grant was also approved for the formulation of a Project in Indonesia involving five selected
towns in West Java. It will cover their strategic urban
development needs and focus on the importance of reducing growth pressure on Jakarta and the Metropolitan
subregion. This Project was identified on the basis of acomprehensive urban sector profile prepared earlier by the
Bank. A similar sector study, to be prepared under a
technical assistance grant, was approved for Malaysia in
1983. Among other things, it will assess urbanization trends,
identify strategic and policy issues and evaluate the development potential of selected regional cities and growth centers.

At the end of 1983, total Bank lending for urban development and housing had reached $306.2 million for 11 projects. Technical assistance extended by the Bank in this sector amounted to $1.93 million.

Education

Bank activities in this sector cover a broad range of
subsectors at both secondary and higher levels, including
vocational and technica! education, agricultural education,
community schools and science education. The need for
education to meet each country’s manpower and development needs is emphasized. Taking a comprehensive approach, the Bank’s projects invariably include hardware components such as buildings and equipment as well as software such as teacher training, curricuium and staff devetopment, provision of academic consultants and institutional
improvements.

During the year, the Bank approved two projects amounting to $126 million in this sector. The Second Vocational
Education Project in Malaysia, for which the tslamic Development Bank also provided co-financing, represents the second
phase of Bank assistance for improving secondary vocational
schools in various engineering fields. The Project involves
the construction and equipping of nine secondary vocational
schools throughout the country as well as the improvement
of teacher training through the provision of technical consuliants and staff fellowships.

The Agricultural Education Project in Indonesia, for which
the Bank approved a foan in 1983, is designed to improve
agricultural manpower both in qualitative and quantitative
terms. Under the Project, 18 existing agricultural secondary
schools will be upgraded and six new agricultural secondary
schools and six new agricultural polytechnics will be
established. Additionally, two Development Centers for
Agriculture will be established, one for vocational education
and the other for polytechnic education.

During the year, the Bank also provided assistance for

43rebuilding 37 cyclone-damaged schools in Tonga as part of
a Multiproject loan.

Eight technical assistance projects amounting to $1.2
miliion were approved in 1983 in this sector, Of these, two.
were regional seminars which were prepared and heid in the
course of the year.

Six technical assistance grants were approved for the
preparation of projects. A Project to provide basic science
facilitles and science teacher training at the secondary level
In Bangladesh will be prepared under a grant of $150,000.
In the Phillppines, a Project wll! be prepared to Improve the
output of middle-level agricultural personnel. In Indonesla,
the University of Sriwijaya, the main source of professional
manpower In Southern Sumatra, will benefit trom a Project
designed to consolidate the unlversity on one campus and
strengthen the facultles of agriculture, engineerlng, medicine
and economics. In the Republic of Korea, a Project to upgrade
about 25 selected vocational tralning centers around the
country will be prepared. In Nepal, the Technical Schools
Project, which will upgrade four existing and 11 new technical
schools and one teacher training center, will be prepared
under a grant of $150,000. The Institute of Management Project in Bhutan, designed to establish a middle-level management institute for developing manpower, will also be prepared
with Bank technical assistance. Moreover, during 1983,
studies of the Education sector in Bangladesh, Indonesia,
Nepal and Slngapore were completed.

of 1983 amounted to $486.4 million for 26 loans and $4.4
mislion for 25 technical assistance projects.

Health and Population

The Bank has significantly increased its support for health
and population activities in recent years. Whereas heatth and
population components were previousiy Inciuded in integrated projects In other sectors — Agriculture, Urban
Development and Water Supply and Sanitation, for example
— it was not unill 1978 that the Bank commenced flnancing
Health and Population projects as such.

During 1983, loans were approved for the Rangoon Genera}
Hospital Project in Burma ($44.6 million) and for the Health
and Family Planning Services Project in Bangladesh ($27.5
miition). Both loans resulted from previous Bank technical
assistance.

The loan to Burma, the second approved by the Bank for
this sector in that couniry, will help improve the capability
of the Rangoon Genera! Hospital to provide modern medical
care io the people of Rangoon, and through the referral
system, more specialized medical services to the entire couniry. The Project is also designed to improve the quality of
medical education, as provided through the General Hospital,
by: better integration of teaching and clinical functions.

The Project in Bangladesh, also the Bank’s second in this
sector in that country, is designed to Improve the health of
the population and reduce the population growth rate through
improvements In the delivery of health care and family planning services. Together with the Project, approval was given
for advisory and operational technical assistance, to be provided by UNDP with the Bank acting as Executing Agency,
designed to assist the Ministry of Health and Population Control In bullding up its capability for processing, storing and
distributing medical supplies.

The Bank approved two project preparatory technical
assistance grants during the year. These were $250,000 for
a Health and Population Project in indonesia and $50,000 for
a Health and Population Project in Pakistan.

In addition, health care facilities in Tonga which had been
destroyed or damaged by a cyclone In 1982 will be
reconstructed under a Multiproject loan approved in 1983,

By the end of 1983, the Bank had approved $206.8 million f

for ten loans to the Health and Population sector and $1.8
million in technical assistance.

Multiproject Loans

Multiproject loans are ciassified separately since they
combine components relating to several sectors in one loan
package, an approach which has been found to be particularly suitable in meeting a variety of needs of the smaiter DMCs,
Two multiproject loans amounting to $7.2 million were approved during 1883. The $5 million Multiproject loan to
Bhutan, the Bank’s first loan in that country, covers six subprojects related to agriculture, forestry, roads, bridges,
telecommunications and water supply; it also includes
technical assistance. The other multiproject loan, $2.2 miltion
for Development and Redevelopment in Tonga, was provided
partly for the reconstruction of certain classrooms and health
centers destroyed by a cyclone, and partly (in collaboration
with IFAD) as a credit line for Tonga Development Bank io
assist the growth of agriculture and small-scale industries.

To date, the Bank has approved five multiproject ioans
amounting to $11.1 million in three DMCs.Loan Administration

Project Impiementation

The Bank's loan administration and project supervision activities in 1983 were characterized by more project reviews
and further streamlining of the Bank’s interna! practices and
procedures. As a result of these efforts, the Bank was better able to identify project problems at an early stage, provide timely and appropriate guidance to borrowers and executing agencies and generally ensure that the projects are
implemented in a more expeditious manner,

The year 1983 commenced with 374 loans under administration. During January-December 1983, 55 new loans
were approved and 31 loans were closed. Thus, the number
of loans under administration as of 31 December 1983 was
398 comprising 339 project loans, 12 program loans, 14 sector loans and 33 development bank credits. Eighteen loans
involved co-financing with external sources. Out of 52 loans
that had become effective as of 31 December 1983, 41 were
carried over from 1982 and 11 were approved in 1983.

On-site review of projects was carried out by 383 loan administration missions, consisting of 25 full review missions,
23 project inception missions, 59 special loan administration missions and 42 project completion missions. The project inception missions were designed to facilitate an early
start on the implementation of projects approved for Bank
financing; the full review missions conducted detailed
reviews of the progress of implementation in 364 projects;
and the special loan administration missions visited 65 projects to deai with specific loan administration problems or
issues. In addition, 21 country disbursement missions were
dispatched to explain disbursement practices and pro

There were also five country project implementation review
misslons whose functions were to review the overall progress
of projects being implemented in the countries visited,
discuss with central government authorities the entire spectrum of government policies, practices and procedures
related to project Implementation, identify and examine common and relevant problems and thelr causes and formulate
recommendations for improvements In policies, practices
and procedures, As a result of these project implementation
review missions, country profile papers were prepared and
circulated for Indonesia, Nepal and Pakistan, while country
profile papers for Philioplnes and Thailand are under preparatlon. A country study dealing with the causes of delays in
the recruitment of consultants in Indonesia was started, and
thls wlil provide recommendations on such key aspects as

approval procedures and country-specific contract clauses.
Several Internal measures were taken to improve the

Bank's loan administration and project supervision functions. A revised set of loan administration instructions (LAIs}
was issued to Bank staff to provide detailed guidance on maiters related to implementation and supervision of projects
and administration of loans.

Moreover, subsiantial progress was made In computerizIng certaln aspects of loan administration. A Loan Financial Information System (LFIS} is now fully operational, providing Instantaneous, accurate and up-to-date data on loan
approvals, procurement and disbursements. A Loan and
Technical Assistance Administration System (LTAAS} is In
the final stages of destgn and programming, which, once it
becomes operational, will provide an efficient project
monitoring mechanism that will effectively assist staff In
their supervision work, For purposes of Individual project
monitoring, Critical Path Method-Project Evaluation and
Review Technique (CPM-PERT) Networks Diagram Charts
were prepared for 21 projects and these have been made
available to staff. With respect to consultants, approximately
85 per cent of af! Data on Consultants (DACON) forms containing information on registered consulting firms and 100
per cent for those pertaining to individual consultants have
now been computerized.

The Bank continued with its training grograms for improving knowledge and skills in project implementation. Two
tegional semlnars on procurement and one regional seminar
on project implementation managemeni were held in Manifa
in which 61 senior and middle-level officials from 59 executing agencies participated, In addition, country seminars
on procurement were held in Sangiadesh, Republic of Korea,
Papua New Guinea and Thailand which were attended by 105
procurement Officers of various Bank-financed projects.

in addition to the training seminars, the Bank responded
to the requests of some member countries for information
dealing with its activities and operations. in this regard, Bank
staff discussed procurement opportunities arising from Bank
projects, as well as on its procurement practices and procedures, in meetings and conferences in Australia, Beigium,
France, India, italy, Republic of Korea and Switzerland. A
number of briefing sessions were also held in the Bank for
groups of visiting businessmen from developed member
countries. A seminar designed to develop consulting
capability was atso held in the Republic of Korea. This program, which wili be provided to other DMCs, is expected to

lead to intensified dialogues between governments and the
local consulting industries on the ways and means of enhancing the domesiic consultants’ capability.

The net value of contracts awarded in 1983' amounted to
$726 million which was less than the unusually high figure
of $1,067 million recorded in 1982. (The large value of contract awards in 1982 was partly due to a spillover of contract
awards from 1981 to 1982.) The amount of $726 million is
broken down into $523 million for ordinary loans and $203
million for Special Funds loans. The decline In 1983 is mainly
atiributable to the tight economic conditions in some DMCs
which made it difficult for them to raise local counterpart
funds for externally financed contracts. Downward adjustments In the dollar value of outstanding contracts
brought about by the coniInued appreciation of the US doliar
aiso contributed to the lower net amount of contracts for
1983. On a cumulative basls, the totaf amount of contracts
awarded up to the end of 1983 amounted to $6,298 million,
which is 57 per cent of effective loans.

Loan Disbursements

In 1983, disbursements amounted to $936.9 million compared with $795.1 million in 1982, an increase of 17.8 per
cent. Disbursements under ordinary loans amounted to
$715.4 million, representing a 15.5 per cent increase over the
1982 figure of $619.6 million. With respect to Special Funds
loans, $221.5 million was disbursed, 26.2 per cent more than
the $175.5 million disbursed in 1982 and a substantial improvement over that year. On a cumulative basis up io the
end of 1983, the total amount withdrawn was $5,441.5 million
which is 49 per cent of effective loans.

The increase in disbursements in 1983 was atiained
primarily due to a sustained effort by the Bank and borrowers
in expediting project implementation, the Implementation of
the Special Assistance Program which provided foreign exchange financing of local currency expenditures for selected
Bank projects for four member countries and the introduotion of new measures such as an Imprest Account system
to facilitate advances being given to executing agencies and
a Statement of Expenditure which significantly simplifies
documentation requirements. Training of executing agency staff to make them thoroughly familiar with the Bank's
policies and procedures for loan withdrawals also contributed to the increased disbursements during the year.

Projects Completed

Twenty-nine projects were compleied in 1983, bringing the
total number of projects completed to 235 out of 611 projects
approved as of the end of the year. Twenty-six Project Completion Reports (PCRs) were prepared and circulated to the
Board of Directors in 1983. These 26 PCRs covered seven
agriculture and rural development projects {seven PCRs),
seven industry and development banks projects (six PCRs),
and 14 infrastructure projects (13 PCRs). As of the end of
1983, a total of 108 PCRs had been circulated to the Board
of Directors. A summary of the significant findings and conClusions contained in the PCRs completed during the year
has been circulated to Bank staff for information and
guidance. it will also be reviewed and analyzed in Project
Performance Audit Reports to be prepared by the PostEvaluation Office.

Project Benefit Monitoring and
Evaluation

Project Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation (PBME) is a sequential series of activities for coliecting and analyzing information which helps ensure that benefits as anticipated
are realized from projects. Projects in agriculture and rural
development in which PBME is called for include those that
incorporate new institutional structures and technologies as
well as those needing cooperation and participation of
beneficiaries.

During 1983, revised PBME Guidelines were prepared for
agricultural and rural development projects for issuance early
in 1984. In addition, PBME provisions for project preparatory
technical assistance grants and appraisal reports were
strengthened, coordination with other donors (particularly
the World Bank and IFAD) was augmented and pilot activities
were initiated to develop suitable monitoring and evaluation
methodologies. Efforts were initiated to improve the
understanding and capabilities of executing agencies to formulate and implement PBME. An advisory and operational
technical assistance was provided to the Directorate General
of Water Resources Development in Indonesia to strengthen
its PBME Unit. In addition, a Regional Workshop/Conference
on PBME was conducted in November 1983 (see page 53).

Post-Evaluation

The Board’s endorsement of the Activities and Procedures
of the Post-Evaluation Office (PEO) and the issuance of the
one hundredth project Post-Evaluation Report (PER) were
among the major features of 1983. In addition, the two-tier
evaluation system covering all the Bank’s completed loan
projects was further refined, particulary with respect to differentiation between the first-tier process, consisting of selfevaluation by the Projects Depariments through the preparation of Project Completion Reports (PCRs), and the second
tier, the preparation of Project Performance Audit Reports
(PPARs) by the Post-Evaluation Office. Guidelines for preparation of PCRs were revised and introduced for the first time
for PPARs.

During 1983, 24 PPARs were prepared compared with 23
in 1982. These 24 PPARs covered six port projects (one each
in Bangladesh, Philippines and Solomon Islands and three
in Malaysia), four water supply projects (one each in Republic
of Korea, Lao PDR, Singapore and Thailand), three power projects (one in the Republic of Korea and two in Thailand}, three
highway projects (two in Malaysia and one in Thailand), three
development bank projects (all in the Republic of Korea}, two
urban housing projects (one each in Hong Kong and Republic
of Korea), one agricultural credit project (in Indonesia}, one
irrigation project (in the Philippines}, one fisheries project
{in Indonesia), two agro-industrial projects (one each in {ndonesia and Burma) and one railway project {in Bangladesh).
As of 31 December 1983, a cumulative total of 105 PPARs
covering 109 projects had been prepared.

Of the four Special Studies initiated in 1982, the Special
Study on Regional Training Programs for Development
Finance Institutions (DFls) was completed and circulated to
the Board in September 1983. Work continued and has
reached an advanced stage on three other studies focusing
on ihe impact of Bank operations in the fisheries subsector
and the effectiveness of project executing agency ar
47rangements and project-related technical assistance. Late
in the year, work began on a study of the effectiveness of
Bank-flnanced Irrigation systems in generating agricultural
production in selected DMCs.

The Fifth Annuat Review of Post-Evaluation Reports was
circulated to the Board in May 1983. It reviewed findings and
conclusions of PPARs prepared for 19 projects in 1982. These
projecis resulted in a total Investment of $800 million, of
which Bank ioans accounted for $285 million or about 36 per
cent. Thirteen projects (about 68 per cent) were judged to
have achleved the objectives set at the tlme of appralsal,
while the other six projects (about 32 per cent} only partly
achleved thelr Intended objectives. The Fifth Review also Incorporated a summary analysis of 60 PERs (out of 81 which
had been prepared by end of 1982) in elght sectors or subsectors — agro-industry, !rrigation, fisherles, highways, ports,
water supply, energy and DFis. Major physical accomplishments of these projects were summarized, common
sectoral Issues identlfted and the strengths and weaknesses
of Bank Involvement in the various sectors and subsectors
discussed.

During the year, the PEO updated the Concordance, a
document with cross-references based on findings and conclusions of individua! PPARs arranged by topical headings.
The revised document, issued to Bank staff in June, is intended to facilitate timely dissemination of evaluation findings and lessons that can contribute to Improvements in the
design and Implementation of ongolng and future Banksupported projects.

The Board of Directors, through Its Audit Committee, continued to monitor PEO’s work program and effectiveness,
During 1983, the Committee discussed eight post-evaluation
studies of specific projects and the completed Special Study.
The Committee submitted its annual report to the Board In
June and expressed satisfaction with the operations of PEO
and the standard of its reports.

Technical Assistance
and Regional Activities

During 1983, the Bank provided $25.3 million in technical
assistance, Including technical assistance for regional activities, for 107 projects compared with $18 million for 80 projects In 1982, representing an Increase of 34 per cent in
number and 40 per cent In amount. Of this, $19.6 mililon was
for project preparatory and advisory/operational technical
ass{stance for 77 projects in 19 DMCs compared with $15.5
million for'56 projects in 12 DMCs in 1982,

About 40 per cent of the increase In the number and almost
half the increase in the amount of technical assistance projects approved during the year were related to regional activitles, for which grants rose from $2.5 million for 24 projects in 1982 to $5.7 million for 30 projects in 1983.

Technical Assistance for DMCs

Technical assistance is an important area of Bank activity. Technical assistance operations facilitate the transter of
resources to DMCs by enabling them to improve their
capabilities to formulate, design, implement and operate
development projects as well as to make effective use of
avallable external project financing, either from the Bank or
other sources.

in recent years, roughly 40 per cent of the Bank's total
technical assistance has been for project preparation, 45 per
cent for advisory and operational purposes and the remaining 15 per cent for regional activities.

During 1983, project preparatory technical assistance
amounted to $9,7 million for 50 projects, while advisory and
operational technical assistance amounted to $9.9 million
for 28 projects.’ These amounts included technical
assistance grant components amounting to $3.6 million incorporaied in 14 Bank loans, of which $0.75 million was for
project preparation and $2.8 million for advisory and operational, including implementation, purposes.

Technical assistance grants are financed mainly from the
Bank's Technical Assistance Special Fund {see page 81). In
addition, the Bank acts as Executing Agency for technical
assistance projects financed from other sources, both
multilateral and bilateral, such as UNDP and the Government
of Switzerland. The Bank also cooperates with the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) on a cost-sharing basis in providing technical assistance for the preparation of projects
in the Agriculture sector.

in 1983, 14 technical assistance projects amounting to $8
million were wholly or partly financed from other sources with
the Bank acting as Executing Agency. These comprised six
projects for $5.4 million from UNDP, seven projects for $2.4
million from the Government of Switzerland and one project
for $248,000 from EEC. In addition, six projects received
assistance from FAO on a cost-sharing basis.

Nineteen DMCs received project preparatory and advisory
and operational technical assistance from the Bank in 1983.
This amounted to $19.6 million for 77 projects. Technical
assistance provided to South Pacific DMCs during the year

million for seven projects in 1982.

On a sectoral basis, 50.2 per cent of the total amount of
technical assistance to DMCs approved in 1983 was for
Agriculture and Agro-Industry compared with 51.8 per cent
in 1982. Technical assistance in this sector covered, among
other things, irrigation, agricultural credit, rural development,
forestry, livestock, fisheries, smallholder agriculture,
aquaculture, integrated area development, foodgrain storage
and cotton development, About 18.2 per cent was provided
to the Energy sector, mainly to cover rural electrification and
mini-hydropower development, 9.6 per cent to Development
Banks, 5.3 per cent to the Transport and Communications
Sector and the rest to Industry and Non-Fuel Minerals and

amounting to $1,07S million resulted from earlier technical
assistance. Of this, $639.2 million was from OCR and $440
miltion from SF, representing 54 per cent ane 62.5 per cent,
respectively, of total loan approvals from each of these
sources in 1983. The importance of technical assistance is
highlighted further by the fact that those DMCs which are
fully eligible for SF lending received $12.6 million for 43 projects during the year compared with $8.1 million for 22 projects in 1982.

Forty-seven technical assistance projects, mostly
approved in previous years, were completed in 1983, 39 for
project preparation and eight for advisory and operational
purposes, bringing the total number of technical assistance
projects completed to 377. The total amount of technical
assistance grants provided to DMCs, including regional activities, as of the end of 1983 stood at $147.3 million.

Study of the Bank’s Role in the South Pacific Devefoping
Member Countries (SPDMCs)' in the 1980s: A Study of the
Bank’s Role in the South Pacific Developing Member Countries
(SPDMCs) in the 1980s was conducted between June and
October primarily by Bank staff with the assistance of an Individual consultant. The Study was undertaken In response
to suggestions made by the Board of Directors and was also
a follow-up of the Study of the Bank's Operational Priorities and

1 Cook islands, Fijl, Kirlball, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga,
Vanuatu and Western Samoa.

Plans for the 1980s which was completed in October 1982.
Based on a detailed review ofthe special characteristics of
the SPDMCs, the Study found that the Bank’s past operational framework remained largely valid. For the future, the
Study made various recommendations so as to enable Bank
operations to respond better to the needs and circumstances
of the SPDMCs and to improve the efficiency of such operations both for the Bank and the SPDMCs. The Study also
recommended establishing a modest-sized Reglonal Office
with appropriate delegation of authority. The findings and
conciuslons of this Study were taken Into account in a Board
review of Bank operations in the SPDMCs.,

Study of Capital Markets in Selected DMCs: The Bank
provided $245,000 for a Study on capital market development
in six selected DMCs, namely, indonesia, Republic of Korea,
Pakistan, Philippines, Si Lanka and Thailand. The Study will
review the current status of capital markets in the selected
DMCs; identify the direction and strategy for future develop
ment of such markets, including appropriate actions to: be
undertaken by the DMCs concerned; explore the areas in
which the Bank can effectively assist capital market development in these DMCs and recommend specific measures to
be taken in this respect. The Study will address both security markets and non-security markets, where medium and
long-term capital is mobilized. The recent economic difficulties and resource constraints encountered by many
DMCs, resulting largely from a slowdown of external capital

a Adjusted to Include additional UNDP financing of $37,490 for the Forestry Davelopment Project (Lao PDA) which was approved In 1978.Operational and Financial Policies

During 1983, the Board of Directors considered several new
operational policies and reviewed a number of financial and
other operational policies.

In the wake of the 1982 Study of the Bank's Operational
Priorities and Plans for the 1980s, the Board of Directors during the year reviewed Bank policies relating to Arrangements
for Lending from the Asian Development Fund, the Bank's
Role in Agricuiture and Rural Development, Program Lending,
Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditures
on Projects, Financing of Interest and Other Charges During Construction, Special Assistance to Selected BankFinanced Projects and Supplementary Financing of Cost
Overruns on Bank-Financed Projects,

On the recommendation of the Board of Directors, the
Board of Governors resolved that the Bank could commence
equity investment operations in its DMCs io catalyze the flow
of funds to private enterprises.

Greater emphasis on loan administration and postevaluation of Bank-financed projects was reflected in the
adoption by the Board of various measures designed to
streamline loan administration procedures and its consideration of the activities and procedures of the Post-Evaluation
Office.

On the resources side, the Board completed a detailed
review of the Bank’s future resource requirements for ordinary operations and submitted to the Board of Governors
for approval a Report and draft Resolution regarding the
Bank’s third General Capital Increase. A comprehensive
review of the Bank’s financial policies was undertaken by
the Board in October.

In addition, several other operational and financial poticy
issues were considered by the Board in 1983, including the
borrowing program for 1983, review of the lending rate, a proposal fo undertake borrowings involving currency fiability
Swap transactions and review of the Technical Assistance
Special Fund.

Review of Arrangements for Lending from
the Asian Development Fund :

In September, the Board reviewed arrangements for lending from the Asian Development Fund (ADF) for the ADF IV
Period, 1983-86. The review reaffirmed the policy of determining a DMC’s eligibility for access to ADF assistance
based on country economic considerations — primarily pet
capita GNP and debt repayment capacity. Special consideration will be given to certain island DMCs in the South Pacific
in determining their eligibility for ADF loans. On the basis
of these eligibility criteria, the classification of DMCs into
three groups remains unchanged as follows:

Group A — Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma,
Cambodia, Cook islands, Kiribati, Lao PDR,
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Solomon
Islands, Sri Lanka, Tonga, Vanuatu, Viet
Nam and Western Samoa.

Group B —_ Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines
and Thailand.

Group C — Republic of China, Fiji, Hong Kong,
Republic of Korea, Malaysia and
Singapore.

The Bank decided to classify Bhutan and Vanuatu — two
new member countries — as Group A countries. In the case
of Bhutan, this decision was based on the country’s extremely low level of per capita GNP and limited debt repayment
capacity, while Vanuatu received the special consideration
accorded to similar South Pacific island DMCs, Based on
country criteria, India would be classified as a Group A country. However, itis not seeking ADF financing during the ADF
W period.

Group A countries will be fully eligible for ADF loans. Additionally, some Group A countries — mainly non-least
developed countries (LLDCs), including Pakistan — may be
provided with a blend of modest amounts of OCR loans it
their needs for development financing are greater than can
reasonably be provided from ADF resources and if the countries nave the Capacity to absorb such modest amounts of
OCR loans.

Because of the relative scarcity of ADF resources, Groups
B and C countries will not have access to ADF funds except
for Papua New Guinea, which, as a Group B country, will be
provided modest amounts of ADF resources in such a manner as to achieve hard blend financing.

Review of the Bank’s Role in
Agriculture and Rural Development

in the context of a reassessment of sectoral performance
since 1976 and a review of future development needs in the
1980s, the Board approved several new recommendations
relating to agriculture and rural development. It also reemphasized the importance and continuity of existing policy objectives as established following the Bank’s Second Asian
Agricultural Survey. In particular, attention must be paid to
the fact that the gap between the Bank's least developed and
its other OMCs has been widening, and that within many
DMCs the poor have become poorer and more
numerous. Similarly, the worsening energy situation and the
deterioration of environmental conditions require definite
shifts inemphasis. The relevant policy paper on the Bank’s
Role in Agriculture and Rural Development reconfirmed the
following priority areas for Bank action in its future opera:
tions: (i) accelerating and sustaining agricultural production
and growth; (ii) ensuring participation of smal! farmers in
production and indome expansion; (iii) providing empioyment for the rural workforce; (iv) increasing foreign exchange earnings and savings; (v) meeting essential energy
needs; (vi) optimizing land use and environmental protection; and {vii) strengthening intersectora} linkages.

In view of the wide economic diversity among DMCs, no
single strategy fits all country situations and needs. The
Bank’s operational strategy in a particular DMC must take
into account the country’s overall strategy and policy
framework as well as development assistance activities of
other donors. Therefore, in order to tailor agriculture and

rural development programs to particular DMC development’

needs, itis essential to develop country-specific operational
strategies in the context of DMC sector planning. Sector
planning in DMCs will be carried out in close consultation
with other donor agencies. Also, Agriculture sector strategy

operations,

Many OMCs suffer from manpower and staff deficiencies,
weak organizational structures and limited experience in the
Implementation of donor-assisted projects. in view of this,
the Bank wifl endeavor to design and implement projects
which take Into consideration the following guiding principles: {I} consultation and particlpation of beneficlarles in
project design and implementation; (il) clear and simple implementation arrangements; (ill) flexibility In design;
(iv) project benefit monitoring and evaluation; and (v} constant monltoring and follow-up of agriculture and rural
development projects by Bank staff. The aim of Implementation arrangements Is to ensure that project penefits are
realized and that the capacity for self-sustalning development
is enhanced.

Review of Program Lending Policies

In March, the Board reviewed and modified the Bank's program iending policies with a view to enhancing the impact
of such tending. Under the revised policy, a program loan
will finance importation of production inputs, spare parts and
balancing or modernizing equipment needed to achieve fuller

capacity utilization, rationalization or modernization in a key
sector or subsector as a whole, Prerequisites for a program
loan are the formulation of a sector development program,
compatibility of such a loan with the activities of the IMF
in the country and a policy dialogue with the government or
the sector authority concerned. If needed, the Bank wiil provide technical assistance for formulating sector or subsector programs and Institution building.

The country celting for program lending was raised from
10 to 20 per cent of the Bank’s anticipated annual lending
to a country. Moreover, in justiflable cases, the amount of
program lending to a country in a particular year may exceed
the ceiling by up to 20 per cent of the anticipated lending
to the country in the following year, subject to appropriate
reduction of such lending in the following two years. The
overall ceiling for program lending was also raised from 5
to 7.5 per cent of the total Bank lending in any one year,

Standard ADF terms (viz., 40 years repayment period including ten years grace) will now be applied to program loans
made from ADF resources, while the terms of program loans
from ordinary capital resources (OCR) will remain unchanged
at 15 years maturity with three years grace period.

The period of program financing will be more flexibly determined, but normally will be three to five years. Project-type
elements included in a program loan wiil be eligible for local
cost financing where such financing !s appropriate. Performance of a program loan fn relation to long-term sector/subsector development objectives will be monitored over
a longer time frame than the period of program support.

Review of Bank’s Policy on Lending Foreign
Exchange for Local Currency Expenditures on
Projects

The policy on local cost financing (LCF) was reviewed in
March, The Board decided that LCF may be provided to all
DMCs except Hong Kong and Singapore and for projects in
all sectors except manufacturing projects and subprojects
in DFl loans. Under the new policy, the amount of LCF will
be the excess (if any) of the loan amount for a project over
the latter’s foreign exchange cost. The joan amount for a
project is determined primarily on country considerations and
normally will not exceed the amount corresponding to the
standard percentage limit determined for each of the country groups, namely, 80 per cent of the total project cost for
a Group A country, 60 per cent for a Group B country and
40 per cent for a Group C country (see page 57).

‘These standard percentage limits wili not be automatically
apptied, the actual percentage of Bank financing being determined case by case based on both country and project considerations. in exceptional cases (e.g., in the financing of
tural community development projects aimed at employment
creation), the Bank may finance a percentage of the total project cost higher than the applicable standard percentage
limit. When a substantial amount of co-financing is involved
in a project, a lower percentage of financing will normally
be provided by the Bank, but this principie may be relaxed
in justifiable cases involving the poorer DMCs, In any case,
ihe Bank will be prepared to consider financing the entire
foreign exchange cost of a project even if this would result
in the standard percentage ilmit being exceeded.

!n sector lending, the extent of Bank financing of the subprojects will be guided by the standard percentage limit. For
program lending, only project-type elements (e.g., provision
for construction of warehouses and repair shops) will be eligible for LCF. In the financing of technical assistance as a
separate project, whether by loan or grant, up to 15 per cent
of Bank financing may be in LCF.

Review of Bank’s Policy on Financing of Interest
and Other Charges During Construction

The Board reviewed the Bank's policy on the financing of
interest and other charges during construction (IDC) in
August and approved certain revised policy guidelines. The
policy revision was made in the light of the deterioration in
economic performance and prospects in DMCs in recent
years and with a view to making the IDC policy consistent
with the Bank's recently revised local cost financing (LCF)
Policy.

Under the revised !DC policy, Bank financing of IDC may
be provided for OCR as well as ADF loans. Consequently,
the Bank’s definition of “interest and other charges” for [DC
financing includes interest and commitment charge on OCR
loans and service charge on ADF loans (currently 1.0 per
cent). As a result of the recently adopted LCF policy, IDC
financing will be provided in accordance with the following
guidelines:

{a) If the total direct and indirect foreign exchange cost
of the project, including IDC, is equal to or less than
the standard percentage limit forthe DMC concerned,

then within'the total loan amount, the first financing
priority is for the foreign exchange components, excluding IDC. The borrower should then have the
choice of receiving the balance of the loan amount
for (DC, LCF, or a combination of both. In such an
event, no couniry or project justification is necessary
for the financing of IDC,

(bd) If the total foreign exchange cost of the project, including IDC, is greater than the standard percentage
limit for the DMC concerned, the Bank will be
prepared to consider financing ail foreign exchange
costs, including IDC. However, the financing of IDC
is not warranted if the balance of payments of the
DMC shows a comfortable situation reflecting, among
other things, a fairly continuous overall balance-ofpayments surplus and a relatively low debt-service
burden; and/or the amount of IDC in a project appears
to be unusually large and could adversely affect or
reduce Bank financing of other projects in the DMC
concernéd.

As under the previous policy, IDC wilt not be financed for
loans to Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) since the
new LCF policy will not apply to such loans. Financing of
IDC can be provided for program loans, unless such financing is not warranted under the special cases mentioned in
(b) above.

Special Assistance to Selected
Bank-Financed Projects

In response to the domestic resource constraints in many
DMCs, the Board early in the year adopted Special
Assistance measures to speed up completion of certain
ongoing Bank-financed projects held back by shortages of
local funds (see page 25).

Review of Supplementary Financing of Cost
Overruns of Bank-Financed Projects

The Board in November revised the Bank's poticy on supplementary financing of cost overruns in order to assist its
DMCs more effectively in their efforts to implement ongoing
Bank-financed projects.

Under the revised policy, flexibility is introduced to enable
the Bank to finance not only cost overruns in both foreign
exchange and local costs but also cost overruns resulting
from causes other than currency realignment and price increases, in considering supplementary financing, the Bank
must be satisfied that such financing is warranted by the
OMC's balance-of-payments position, that the government
is making every reasonable effort to mobilize domestic
resources, including government revenues, and that it is pursuing appropriate policies in allocating resources. Financing of cost overruns wilt be considered on a case-by-case
basis after re-appraisal of the project concerned, taking full
account of the following:

(a) the review of each project should aim to establish the
principal reasons for the cost overrun, including the
identification of corrective actions taken or agreed to
be taken;

59(pb) the project remains a clearly viable priority in the
government's development strategy;

(c) the possibility of reducing the project scope or
chang!ng the design standards is found to be either
undestrable or not feasible; and

{d) the borrower has made a genuine but unsuccessful
effort to find alternative Hnancing on reasonable
terms.

Finanolng of cost overruns will be considered on both
foreign exchange (direct and Indirect) and local cost expenditures of the project concerned. Where local cost financing Is Involved in a supplementary toan, the standard percentage limits Introduced under the revised loca! cost financing
(LCF) policy may be applied, as appropriate, to the revised
total cost of the ongoing project. However, the actual level
of suppiementary loan to be provided for any particular projact will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Where no
local cost financing is involved in a supplementary loan, the
Bank will be prepared to consider financing the entire foreign
exchange cost (both direct and indirect} of the project. The
Bank will also be prepared to consider using savings under
the Bank loans to meet either foreign exchange or local cost
overruns, even where there [is no total project cost overrun,

The provision of a supplementary loan from the Bank's ordinary resources (OGR) or Special Funds resources would
depend on the eilgibillty status of the DMC concerned for
lending from the Asian Development Fund (ADF) prevailing

LABORERS building an irrigation canal at ihe Bankfinanced Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement Project in Sri
Lanka which Is designed to provide Irrigation faclilties and
settle about 4,200 landless farm families in one of the couniry's dry regions.

 

at the time of processing such aloan. The interest and commitment charge on a supplementary loan, if financed from
OCR resources, will be those prevailing at the time of supplementary loan approval. If financed from ADF resources,
the supplementary loan will carry the standard service
charge. Repayments of a supplementary loan from OCR
resources wil! be synchronized with those of the original
loan. For a supplementary loan financed from ADF
resources, the standard ADF terms wil! apply.

in the case of co-financing, every effort will be made by
the Bank and the government concerned towards reaching
agreement with co-financing instltutions to share supplementary financing proportionally among the original cofinanciers.

Equity Investment Operations by the Bank

Based on the recommendation of the Board of Directors,
the Board of Governors resolved in March that the Bank may
commence and carry out operations involving investment of
funds in the equity capital of institutions or enterprises
operating In Its DMCs.

The Bank’s equity investments would be in productive
enterprises in DMCs for specific projects, or DFis or similar
institutions, or In smaller enterprises through lines of equity extended to DFis. The eligible enterprises should be in
the private sector, but investment could also be undertaken
in “mixed” enterprises In special clrcumstances, if such
enterprises are substantially in private hands, privately
managed and In a position to set product prices relatively
freely, Equity assistance wouid be avallable for the establishment, expansion, diversification, modernization or improvement of allgibie enterprises, as well as DFIs and similar institutlons, The Bank wil! Invest only in projects which have
a high socio-economic priority and are potentially profitable.

The Bank may invest In ordinary or preferred shares as appropriate, and may decide or agree to underwrite share issues
in an appropriate amount.

As a general rule, the Bank will not be the majority or the
largest sharehoider. The Bank wili not seek a controlling interest in an assisted enterprise or institution, or assume a
responsibility for managing it except where necessary to
safeguard the Bank’s Investment. The Bank's participation
wil! not normally exceed 20 per cent of the capital stock of
the enterprise or institution assisted. The Bank will seek to
use its equity investment funds ina revolving manner and
generally endeavor to sell the investments in its portfolio at
a fair price as soon as possible (for further details, see page
29).

Policies Under Consideration

Operational policies currently under review or expected
to be reviewed in 1984 include those relating to Bank operations in the South Pacific DMCs,’ credit tines to development finance institutions, co-financing with official sources,
technical assistance operations, sector lending and domestic
procurement. The introduction of measures to assist the
private sector in DMCs, other than through equity investments, is also being considered by the Bank.

 

1. It was decided in early 1984 to establish a regional office in Vanuatu.

 

ijInter-Agency Cooperation

During 1983, the Bank continued to strengthen its links
with those other major international organizations concerned
with the social and economic progress of the Asia-Pacific
region. Contacts were increased with, among others, the
World Bank Group, the International Fund for Agricultural
Development, the OPEC Fund for international Development,
the United Nations Development Programme, the Food and
Agriculture Organization and the European Economic
Community.

Meeting of International Financial institutions: In
September, the President of the Bank attended a meeting
of International Financial Institutions (IFls) in Washington,
D.C. The discussions focused on the development policy implications of the current financial difficulties faced by the
institutions’ member couniries and what the institutions
could de te facilitate the adjustment process and io increase
resource flows to those counises.

World Bank Group: During the year, the Bank maintained
close contact with the World Bank, At the fifth annual ADBWorld Bank high-level coordination meeting, held in May at
the Bank’s Headquarters, overall policy matters of interest
fo both institutions were discussed.

Development Committee Meetings: The President of the
Bank attended the Twenty-Second Development Committee
Meeting in Washington, D.C., in September. The meeting
discussed the need for, and dimensions of, a selective capital
increase for the World Bank, the status of negotiations for
the IDA VII replenishment, the continuing need to give priority
on concessional! flows to sub-Saharan African countries and
the need for expanding flows of private investment to
developing couniries, including the plans for a capital increase for the International Finance Corporation (IFC). The
Bank was also represented at the Twenty-First Meeting of
the Committee in April. :

international Fund for Agricultural Development: The
Bank concluded a Cooperation Agreement with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in 1978.
Since that time, one or more projects have,been co-financed
by the Bank and IFAD each year, while a number of projects
have been prepared by the Bank for exclusive financing by
IFAD. During 1983, arrangements were made to co-finance
three more projects — in Indonesia, Solomon Islands and
Tonga — with IFAD’s contribution to be $27.5 million. The
Number of co-financed loans with IFAD now totals 15 with
IFAO’s share amounting to $174.7 million.

OPEC Fund for International Development: For the first
time since the establishment of the OPEC Fund for International Development in 1976, there were no co-financing operations between the OPEC Fund and the Bank. Close contact
was maintained, however, through visits to Fund Headquarters. The Bank was represented at the Donor Agencies
Coordination Meeting, held in Vienna at the end of May,
which devoted a special session to co-financing with commercial sources.

United Nations Development Programme: During 1983,
the Bank and the United Nations Development Programme

{UNDP} continued to cooperate closely for. the provision of
project preparatory and advisory services to DMCs. The Bank
agreed to act as Executing Agency for six technical
assistance projects, including one regional project, wholly
or partly financed by UNDP amounting to $5.4 million compared with six projects for $4.3 million in 1982. UNDP
assistance channelled through the Bank for the period
1978-83 was primarily for the least developed couniries in
the Bank’s region. Bangladesh received $8.5 million, or 30.3
per cent, of such assistance, while Nepal received $141.26
million, or 36 per cent. Other beneficiaries were Burma,
Indonesia, Lao PDR, Philippines and Thailand.

Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific: Research and policy coordination between the
Bank and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific (ESCAP) continued in 1983 through written communications and exchange of visits by senior staff. Bank staff
attended several important ESCAP meetings and seminars
during the year, including the Thirty-Ninth Session of ESCAP
in April, the Third ‘Session of the ESCAP Committee on
Population in August and the Second Econometric Modeling Seminar sponsored by ESCAP in September, all held in
Bangkok.

 

61Food and Agriculture Organization: Under revised Working Arrangements between the Bank and the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAQ), it was agreed in 1983 that
the FAO Investment Center would prepare six projects for
the Bank. In each case, the Investment Center had speciai
experience or competence qualifying it for this role over consulting firms, apart from the advantage to the Bank of costsharing under the Working Arrangemenis. The annual review
of the cooperative program between the Bank and the Invesiment Center was held In October, while exchange of
statistical and other data between the Bank and FAO also
continued.

Aid Group Meetings: Bank representatives particlpated
in the annuai Ald Group Meetings organized by the Worid
Bank for Bangladesh, Burma, Republic of Korea, Pakistan,
Philippines and Sri Lanka. In addition, the Bank was also
represented at the World Bank-coordinated meeting for
Pakistan's sixth Five-Year Development Plan. The Bank also
participated in the UNDP-organized Asia-Pacific Round Table
Meeting of LDCs and their Deveiopment Partners, held in
Geneva. It was also represented at the annual meeting of the
Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGi).

European Economic Community: Following extensive
consultations and agreement between the European
Economic Community (EEC) and the Bank on the issue of
eligibility of consultants from members of both inst!tutions
to undertake technical assistance projects flnanced under

ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES
AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Separation of Operations

IN ACCORDANCE with its Articles of Agreement, the Bank's
ordinary capital resources and Special Funds resources are
held, used and committed entirely separate from each
other. The ordinary and special operations of the Bank are
shown separately in its financial statements. Moreover, the
Bank’s ordinary capital resources may under no circumstances be charged with, or used to discharge, losses
or liabilities arising out of its special operations. The Bank’s
administrative expenses are currently allocated between ordinary capital resources and Special Funds resources on the
basis of the number of loans respectively approved from each
of these resources. Funds raised by the Bank through bortowings are included in the Bank's ordinary capital resources
and used in its ordinary operations.

Third General Capital Increase

A detailed review of the Bank’s future resource requirements for ordinary operations, which the Board of Directors had undertaken pursuant to Governors’ Resolution
No. 134 adopted in May 1980, was completed in early
1983. The Board concluded that a substantial increase in the
Bank’s authorized capital was necessary at an early date to
enable the Bank to continue its ordinary lending operations
at an appropriate level during the years 1983-87. The Board
accordingly recommended to the Board of Governors that
the Bank’s subscribed capital be increased by 105 per cent,
of which 5 per cent should be in the form of paid-in shares,
and that of the payments for paid-in shares, 40 per cent
should be in convertible currency and 60 per cent in the national currency of the subscribing member. On 25 April 1983
the Board of Governors adopted Resolution No. 158 authorizing a third General Capital Increase (GCI lil} as recommended
by the Board of Directors. The increase, which became effective on the date of adoption of the Resolution, amounts

to $7,901.9 million (SDR7,547.5 million} and is divided into
754,750 shares, each having a par value of $10,000 in terms
of US dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on 31
January 1966. Of these shares, 37,738 are paid-in shares and
717,012 are callable shares. The Resolution envisages 31
May 1984 as the final date for subscribing to GCI fil.

Authorized and Subscribed Capital

Including the additional shares authorized for GCI Ill, the
Bank’s authorized capital stock as of 31 December 1983
amounted to $15,461.4 million (SDR14,768.1 million}. During
the year, subscriptions to GCI Ill were made by ten member
countries (Australia, Canada, Cook islands, Denmark, India,
Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Philippines, United
Kingdom and United States) for a tofal amount of $4,013.4
million (GDR3,833.4 million).! As of 31 December 1983, the
Bank’s subscribed capital stock stood at $11,510.0 million
{SDR10,993.8 million).

Valuation of Capital and Maintenance of Value

The capital stock of the Bank is defined in its Articles of
Agreement in terms of United States dollars of the weight
and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966. Since the coming
into effect of the Second Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on 7 April 1978,
currencies no longer have par vaiues in terms of gold. The
implications of this change for the valuation of the Bank's
capital stock are under examination by the Bank. Pending
a decision on this matter, the value of the Bank’s capital
stock is expressed, for purposes of the Bank’s financial
statements, in terms of the SDR on the basis that each share
has the value of SDR16,000. The mutual obligations of each
member and the Bank with respect to maintenance of value
of currency holdings are also measured by the same siandard, but settlement of such obligations is being held in

from France and Indonesia.

abeyance. For purposes of the financial statements, the SDR
is translated into current United States dollars at the rate
computed by the IMF. As of 31 December 1983, the rate was
$1.04695 per SDR. Further information on vaiuation of capital
and maintenance of value is given in Notes A and D of the
Notes to Financial Statements of Ordinary Capital
Resources, Appendix 1-VII.

Special Increases in Subscriptions

in 1982, the Board of Directors approved a procedure for
multilateral consultation In regard to requesis from Individual
member countries for speciat increases In their capital
subscriptions. Following recelpt by the Bank of a number
of requests for special Increases, the Board of Directors In
1983 gave further consideration to possible criteria for dealIng with such requests.

Review of Financial Policies

A comprehensive review of the Bank's financial policies
was undertaken by the Board of Directors in October. The
review took into account, inter alia, a report on financial
policies submitted in April by Dr. Irving S. Friedman, an Internatlonal financial expert. Pursuant to the review, the present policies on Income and reserves, Ilquidity and borrowings are substantially unchanged, while further consideration wiil be given to the modalities for the eventual removal
of the limitation which currently restricts the Bank's borrowings to 100 per cent of the callable capital of members whose
currencies are convertible. Foilowtng also from the review,
a paper was submitted to the Board of Directors In December
incorporating a recommendation to the Board of Governors
for a gradual reduction and discontinuation of the transfers
of commissions to the special reserve.'

Borrowings

During 1983, the Bank made 15 borrowings amounting to
the equivalent of $979.4 million comgared with a total of
$881.8 mlillon ralsed in 1982. Detaifs df the year’s borrowIngs are shown in the table on page 75.

in order to enable the Bank to Increase its access to lowcost currencies, the Board of Directors in March authorized
the Bank fo undertake borrowings involving currency labllity swap transactions.

In addition to obtaining relatively favorable borrowing
terms, the Bank was able to diversify the currencies and
markets of its borrowings. It made its first public offering
in the Eurodoliar market and entered the Austrian caplial
market for the first time since 1971.

A total of $265 million was raised in US dollars, consisting
of $65 million in Two-Year US dollar bonds placed in March
with central banks and monetary authorities in 28 member
countrles, $100 million in a public offering in the United
States capita! market in April and $100 million in the
Eurodoilar issue floated in October. Of the proceeds from

coramitments received by the Bank from developed member
countries surpassed the necessary $1,600 million’ required
for effectiveness pursuant to the Resolution.

At the end of 1983, ADF IV contribution commitments had
been received from 18 member countries? for a total amount
of $2,972 mitlion.? Sixteen of these countries, namely,
Australia, Austria, Republic of China, Denmark, Finland,
France, Federal Republic of Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland and United Kingdom, had deposited unqualified
contribution commitments, while two countries, Canada and
the United States, had deposited contribution commitments
containing a qualification, in accordance with the provisions
of the Resolution, that all instalment payments except the
first would be subject to budgetary apprépriations.

in depositing its ADF (V contribution commitment, the
United States was able to make available a first tranche of
only $97 million instead of the full $130 million envisaged
in Resolution No. 154. Pursuant to the provisions of the
Resolution, therefore, the second tranches of the unqualified
contributions were due for release to the Bank on 1 January
1984 in the same proportion as the United States’ first
tranche.

Progress of Earlier ADF Replenishments

in March 1983, the United States made available a further
$3.6 million of the outstanding balance of its contribution
to the first ADF replenishment (ADF II}. Consequently, at the

 

1 Atthe exchange rates specified in Resolution No. 154,
2 Acostibution commitment was received from Zeigium in March 1984,

end of 1983 the outstanding balance of this contribution was
$28.2 million. The deadline for payment of the U.S. contribution was extended by Governors’ Resolution No. 145, adopted
In October 1881. The Resolution provides that the Governors
will fix the final date when the United States informs the Bank
of a new payment schedule.

By the end of 1982, contribution commitments to the second ADF replenishment (ADF III} had been received from all
17 developed member countries. However, the Bank had not
received payment of the last $3 million of the United States’
contribution. Accordingly, the Board of Governors, by
Resolution No. 156 adopted in January 1983, extended the
final payment date to 31 December 1983. The $3 million
baiance of the U.S, contribution was received by the Bank
towards the end of 1983. The full ADF Ili amount of $2,144
million (at 1 April 1978 exchange rates) had accordingly been
made available to the Bank.

Availability and Utilization of ADF Resources

At the beginning of 1983, total ADF resources amounted
to $3,617 million. During the year, the Bank received the first
tranches of ADF iV contributions. Payments totalling $12.6
million were made by the United States towards ADF fl and
Ill, and an amount of $18 million accrued to ADF by way of
net income. Total resources, net of changes in value in terms
of the United States dollar, increased over the year by $590
million to $4,207 million. After ailowing a provision of $215
million for exchange rate fluctuations, net resources stood
at $3,992 million.

New concessional loans approved during the year totalled
SDR665 million. At the exchange rates applicable at the time
of joan approval, this was equivalent to $703.4 million. After
taking account of repayments, cancellations and exchange
rate adjustments, net loan commitments, at the 31 December
1983 rates, amounted to $644 million, bringing cumulative
net loan commitments as of 31 December 1983 to $4,048
million. As a result, pending release of the second tranches
of unqualified ADF iV contributions on 1 January 1984,! the

 

1. The second tranches of unqualified ADF IV contributions were released to
the Bank on 1 January 1984 in proportion to the extent (74.62%) that the iirst
instalment of the United States’ qualified contribution had become available
to the Bank, The total amount released was $374 million.

Under its terms of reference, the Committee reviewed the

Vice-Presidents

On 27 January 1983, acting on the recommendation of the
President, the Board of Directors decided that the Bank
should have three Vice-Presidents from 1 April 1983 and appolnted Mr. Gunther Schulz as the third Vice-President with
effect from 1 April 1983.

Organization

With the appoiniment of a third Vice-President In April
1983, the responsibilities at the top management level were
redistributed. Operational departments and offices were
placed together under one group for the Vice-President
(Operations) covering development policy, country economic
and general economic work, country programming, and central loan administration, procurement and consulting services. Another group of such departments responsible for
sector work and processing and implementation of loan and
technical assistance projects was placed under the VicePresident (Projects).

In the early part of 1983, the Agriculture and Rural Development Department was expanded from five to six divisions
with the creation of the Agricultural Services Division which
has responsibility for the processing and administration of
more complex loan and technical assistance projects involving the review of policy issues. The Division is also responsible for the coordination and undertaking of sector policy
studies, the development of sector strategles by country, participation in project identification and country programming,
review and monitoring (including project benefit monitoring
and evaluation) of projects under implementation, jiaison
with other Internationa! organizations and departmental consolidation of general administrative matters.

Towards the end of 1983, several new measures relating
to the operational activities of the Bank were introduced.
These measures, involving revised organizational and ad-ministrative arrangements, were directed towards the expeditious processing of loan and technical assistance proposals. Other related measures Called for greater delegation
of responsibility in project processing and were intended to
enable the Bank to cope with the increasing size of the operational program.

Following organizational studies in the second half of the
year, it was decided to reorganize the Agriculture and Rural
Development Department into an Agriculture Department and
an Irrigation and Rural Development Department, effective
1 January 1984. Towards the end of 1983, a proposal to open
a South Pacific Regional Office in the latter part of 1984 was
submitted to the Board of Directors.'

Internal Audit

internal auditing provides Management with periodic, independent and objective evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of managerial controls and related systems and
procedures in the financial, accounting, administrative, data
processing and other functions of the Bank. The overall objective is to assist Heads of Departments and Offices and
Managers of other levels in the effective discharge of their
responsibilities. The Internal Audit Office (IAG) reports to the
President.

 

1 it was decides in early 1984 to establish a regional office in Vanuatu.

The results of audits, comprising findings, analyses, conclusions and recommendations, are conveyed to Management and departments or offices concerned by separate
report for information and action as appropriate. Copies of
certain audit reports are also conveyed to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors which may review selected
reports with the representative of |AO and/or departments
or offices concerned. The Audit Committee also reviews the
status of implementation of |AO’s recommendations and its
annual work program.

1AO performs audits pertaining to all functions of the Bank
to identify areas that may be in need of improvement in efficiency, economy and effectiveness. It examines and
evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of controls, the
reliability and integrity of financial and operating information and the adequacy of safeguards for the Bank’s
resources. IAO also reviews the extent of compliance with
the Bank’s policies, guidelines, systems, procedures and
agreements, including the adequacy and effectiveness of
controls inherent in the computer environment. It reviews and
tests computer systems which have been implemented
and/or are in the process of conversion from manual systems.

Review and testing of computer systems which have been
implemented or are in the process of conversion from
existing systems was made more effective with the engagement of consultants. A comprehensive and up-to-date audit
manual had been completed to enhance IAO’s efficiency.

Computer and Office Automation Systems

During 1983, the comprehensive computer data base which
supports the Bank's major financial, administrative and
operational activities was stabilized and enhanced. The processing of the accounting systems and related databases

The following computer applications were implemented
during the year; Project Processing Information Sysiem used
by the Country Department, Data on Consultancy Firms and
Individual Consultants used by the Central Projects Services
Office, Investments Portfolio System used by the Treasurer's

TECHNICIANS checking one of six air compressors

The total number of professlonat workstations as of 31
December 1983 was 69 computer terminals and printers, 42
word processing and office automation workstations, including phototypesettlng, updateable microfiche, telex punch
equipment linked to word processing systems, elghi
microcomputers used primarily in electronic spreadsheet
computation and flnanclal analysis, two portable microcomputers and eight Tejerate terminals for financial market information. The extensive use of the systems contributed to
Bank productivity In the areas of lending operations, financial control, economic analysis and administration.

Research Activities

During the year, a number of research projects were undertaken by the Bank on economic conditions and Issues in its
DMCs. A major study was made of ways of mobilizing
domesilc resources through financlal development in
sefected developing countries. The study critically viewed
financial development In orders to identify savings and financial sector pollcles, as well as innovations and reforms that
might raise the level of resource mobilization, particularly
in low-saving DMCs,

Studies were also completed on agriculture, energy, small
and medium-scale industry, income distribution, external
debt, and debt-servicing capacity, as well as on the economic
performances and forecasts of selected DMCs. Comprehensive guidefines for economic evaluation of projects were also
prepared for the guidance of Bank staff, During the year,
several new publications were released under the ADB
Economic Staff Papers and Economics Office Report series.

in April 1883, the Bank’s new journal, the Asian Development Review: Studies of Asian and Pacific Economic Issues, was
published and was followed by a second issue in December.
Under the Bank’s Distinguished Speakers Series, which was
initiated in 4982, eminent economists were invited to deliver
lectures on various aspects of socio-economic development.

Office Accommodation

During the year, the Office of Administrative Services
undertook an in-depth study of the Bank's office space requirements up to 1987. This study took into account such
factors as the steady increase In the number of staff, the need
to alleviate existing congestion, rationalizing the fragmentation of the Bank in several buildings and accommodating
new services such as computers and word processors,

Various options for the acquisition of additional space —
estimated to total 3,400 square meters — were examined on
the basis of the least-cost approach and considerations of
operational efficiency. The Office Accommodation Project,
as finally approved by the Board of Directors, comprised four
subprojects involving an estimated total capital expenditure
of $1.2 million.THE CHASHMA Right Bank irrigation Project in Pakistan, for which the Bank approved a $31.5 million loan, will help in
%

crease agricultural production in a food deficit area of the Northwest Frontier and Punjab Provinces by more effective use of
water from the Indus River. EEC and World Food Program have also provided assistance for this Project,

New Headquarters Building

In February, the Board approved the general proposal to
construct the Bank's new Headquarters building in Ortigas
Commercial Center and the engagement of consultants for
the preparation of preliminary design proposals, cost
estimates and related studies. Six hectares of land for the
building were purchased and registered in the Bank's
name. Consultants, engaged by the Bank, commenced work
in mid-July and submitted their final report in
November. Project appraisal was undertaken and completed
on the basis of the consultants’ proposals. The Board of
Directors is expected to consider a proposal early in 1984
for proceeding with the construction of the new Headquarters
building at the site acquired by the Bank.

Staff.

As of 31 December 1983, the Bank’s staff had reached a
total of 1,469" from 33 member countries. Of this number,

7 Including Management but excluding positions aliocabie to, Capital
Expenditures.

551 belonged to the professional staff category and 918 to
the supporting staff category. During the year, there were
66 professional staff appointments and 29 terminations of
appointment. In the supporting staff category, 84 appointments were made and 27 staff resigned.

Successful recruitment and low turnover during 1983
resulted in more than 98 per cent of professional staff positions being filled at year’s end; this staffing level is the best
yet achieved by the Bank.

The professional staff position classification and compensation programs which were approved in late 1982 were fully implemented during the year. A comprehensive review of
the Bank’s Staff: Retirement Plan was completed, and
significantly improved retirement, withdrawal and death and
disability benefits were approved by the Pension Committee and the Board of Directors. The annual review of staff
salaries was conducted in tate 1983 to take into account
developments in the compensation of local and international
comparator organizations and trends in relevant cost-of-living
indicators. The Board approved, effective 1 August 1983,
general salary increases of 4.5 per cent for professional staff
and 16 per cent for supporting staff as well as certain improvements in staff benefits.

During the year, the Bank continued to offer training and
development opportunities to all staff in the areas of opera

tional, protessional and managerial skills. Development and
improvement of personnel systems during 1983 included the
computerization of personnel data and staffing actions. It
is anticipated that additional major computer-based subsystems In the Personnel Management Information System
will be fully implemented in 1984, ¢

Staff Housing Scheme

The Bank's rental assistance scheme continued during the
year. A proposal for a staff housing scheme as a long-term
solution to the housing problems of professional staff has
aiso been under consideration. The proposal is being reviewed in the light of current and prospective developments
In the Manila housing market.

Budget

internal Administrative Expenses for 1983 amounted to
$70,329,236 against the orlginal Budget of $77,524,000,
representing 90.72 per cent utilization of the latter. The
underrun of $7,194,764 against the Budget is due mainly to
savings in staff salaries, benefits and relocation on account

_ of the lower number of staff appointments/replacements,

lower than projected professional staff general satary increase and some economy achieved in budget utilization. The favorable effect of exchange rate fluctuations also
contributed to the lower utilization, in addition, the general
contingency of $1.5 million was not utilized.

The Administrative Budget for 1984, which was approved
in December 1983, is summarized In Appendix 2. It provides
for Internal Administrative Expenses in 1984 amounting to
$82,639,000, an increase of $12.3 million over actual expenses
in 1983. The increase Is largely attributable to: {i} full-year
effect of the past year’s staff increase and to additionai staff
required for activities prograramed for 1984; {I} salary and
benefits Improvements approved in 1983 and further improvements subject to consideration in 1984; {lil} increased
consultant services and business travel required for the
Bank's work in 1984; (lv) additlonai overheads, including expendable suppiles, contractual services, depreciation
charges, etc., for supporting the Bank’s functions; and (vy) past
and prospective price escalation.

Commitments for Services to Member Countries in 1983
amounted to $17,302,000, representing 91 per cent utilization
of the budget of $19,000,000 and an increase of 38 per cent
over actual commitments of $12,575,300 in 1982. Provision
is made in 1984 for new commitments amounting to
$22,000,000, representing an increase of 27 per cent over the
aciuai commitments in 1983.STATISTICAL ANNEX

NOTE A —

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(1)

(2)

83)

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of members are functional currencies. The reporting currency is the United States
doilar, and the financial statements are expressed in
thousands of current United States dollars.

Capital Stock

The capital stock is defined in Article 4, paragraph 1
of the Articles of Agreement “in terms of United
States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on
31 January 1966” (the 1966 dolfar). The capital stock
had historically béen translated into the current
United States doliar (the Bank's unlit of account), on
the basis of its par value In terms of gold. From 1973
untll 31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on this basis
was $1.20635 per 1966 dollar. Since 1 Aprii 1978, at
which tlme the Second Amendment to the Articles of
Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
came Into effect, currencies no longer have par
values In terms of gold. The Bank is examining the
implications of thls change on the valuation of its
capltai stock but has not made a decision on the matter. Pending such a decision, the Bank’s capital
stock has been valued for purposes of the accompanylng financial statements in terms of the Special
Drawing Right (SDR), at the value in current United
States dollars as computed dy the IMF. As of
31 December 1983, the SDR was valued at $1.04695
($1.10311 — 1982). (See Note D. This note also shows
what the value of the Bank's capital stock would be if
expressed in terms of $1.20635 per 1966 dollar.)

Transiation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities and capital are translated from
their functional currencies to the reporting currency
generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the
end of a reporting period. Income and expense
amounis are translated for each seml-monthly period
(quarterly period — 1982) generaily at the applicable

(4)

®)

rates of exchange at the beginning of each period;
such practice approximates the application of
average rates In effect during the period, Transtation
adjustments, other than those relating to malntenance of vaiue of currency holdings (see Note &),
are charged or credited to “Accumulated translation
adjustments”. Exchange gains or losses on currency
transactions among functional currencies are inciuded In Income. Currency swaps made in connection
with borrowings are hedged by forward exchange
commitments, and accordingly do not result in any
net exchange gain or loss.

Loans

Effective 1 January 1983, the Bank adopted an Exchange Alsk Poollng System for lis lending operations as a means of equallzing exchange rate risks
among borrowers. Al! foans negotiated after that
date have been included in the system and borrowers
under earlier ioans ars given the option of having the
undisbursed balances of their loans Included In the
system. The pool consists of all currencies disbursed
and not yet due for repayment under ali loans or portions of loans included in the system (pooled loans).
The principal amount withdrawn and outstanding
under each pooled loan consists of fts pro-rata share
of each of the currencies and the composite exchange adjustment of the pool from ilme to time. The
borrowers of loans and portions of loans not inciuded in the system remain obligated to repay the Bank
the currencies used by the Bank in making disbursements on their loans. .

Property, Furniture and Equipment

The headquarters building of the Bank, including
land, facllities and fixtures and the initial cost of
necessary staff amenities and other related furnishings have been provided to the Bank by the
Government of the Republic of the Philippines which
has also provided additional office space in a second
building. The Bank has leased additional office
space In other bulidings and has fitted and furnished
ail additional office space. Signiflcant purchases of
property, furniture and equipment by the Bank arecapitalized and depreciated over estimated usefut
lives of related assets using the straight-line method.
Other purchases are charged to expense.

To meet the Bank's need for future office accommodations, the Bank has purchased a parcel of land
in Metro Manila at the original cost of $9,555,000 for
the consiruction of a proposed new headquarters
buiiding. Other costs capitalized in connection with

average amortized cost.and the net proceeds of
sales, The annualized rate of return on the average

The authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of
1,476,807 shares {722,057 — 1982), of which 1,099,380

restricted,

In accordance with Articie 24, paragraphs 2(i) and (i),
the use by the Bank or by any recipient from the Bank
has been restricted by two members to payments for
goods or services produced in their territories. Cash
in banks and demand obligations tofalting $35,000

respectively, have been so restricted.

As of 31 December 1983, the market vaiue of investments was $2,129,723,000 ($1,862,950,000 —
1982), including investments not traded in the market
(time deposits, etc.) which were valued at their cost
or amortized cost of $1,014,910,000 {$727,786,000 —
4982). During the year ended 31 December 1983, sales

— 1982) are “callable” and 158,339 (139,173 — 1982)
are “paid-in”. The “catlable” share capital is subject
to call by the Bank only as and when required to meat
the Bank’s obligations incurred on borrowings or on
guarantees. The “paid-in” share capital is payable or
has been paid in instalments, partly in convertible
currencies and partly in the currency of the subsertbing member. in accordance with Article 6, paragraph
3 of the Articles, the Bank accepts non-negotiable,
non-interest-bearing demand obligations in satisfaction of the portion payable in the currency of the
member, provided such currency is not required by
the Bank for the conduct of its operations.

In the Articles, the Bank's capita! stock is defined “in
terms of United States dollars of the weight and
fineness in effect on 31 January 1966”, and the value
of each share of stock is defined as being 10,000
4966 dollars. On 1 April 1978, the Second Amendment
to the IMF Articles entered into force, under which

NOTE'G — gold has been abolished as a common denominator
of the international monetary system, currencies no
INVESTMENTS longer have par values, and all calculations for the

purposes of the IMF Articles are made on the basis of
the SDR. Simultaneously, the provision of United
States law defining the par vaiue of the United States
dollar in terms of gold was repealed. As a result of
these changes, the pre-existing basis for translating

United States dollars, or into any other currency, no
longer exists. ‘

The Bank ts considering a proposal that Its capital
stock be redefined In terms of the SDR. A member
government has ralsed the question whether the
substitution of a new unit of value, insofar as it
would give rise to any new obligations with respect
to maintenance of value and capital stock subscriptlon paymenis, should be made only by amendment
of the Articles. This member has also raised questlons as to the appropriateness of substituting a unit
of vajue other than the SDR, the desirability of retainIng the principle of maintenance of value, and the
form in which maintenance of value should be
applied.

The General Counsel of the Bank !s of the opinion
that the SDR is the successor in the International
monetary system to the goid-based dollar, and that
pending the exercise by the appropriate authoritles
of the Bank of their statutory powers under Chapter
IX of the Articles, references In the Articles to the
4966 dollar should be read as referring to the SDR as
defined from time to time by the IMF. In view of this,
and pending consideration and action on the issues
referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Bank has
for purposes of these financial statements expressed the vatue of its capital stock In terms of the
SDR, on the basis that each share has the value of
SDR10,000. For purposes of these financial
statements, it has also measured the mutual obligatlons of each member and of the Bank with respect to
maintenance of value of currency holdings by that
standard. However, the appropriate authorities of the
Bank could decide that the value of each share
should be fixed at $42,063.50, on the basis of a
substitution of 1.20635 current United States dollars
for each 1966 doltar,

When the SDR was introduced into the IMF Articles
in 1969, it was expressed in terms of a specified
weight of gold equa! to ihe gold content of the 1966
dollar. Since 1 July 1974, its value has been based on
the weighted reiative values of a number of major
currencies {a “currency basket”). On 1 July 1974, the
vaiue of the SDR, expressed in terms of United States
dollars was $1.20636, namely the same value as ihe

 

1966 dollar, but subsequently the value in current
monetary terms has varled from day to day. Effective
1 July 1978, the IMF made certain adjustments In the
SDR currency basket, and established a method for
further adjustmenis at five-yearly intervals, to refiect
changes in.the relative importance of currencies over
time, while ensuring continuity and reasonable
predictability for the valuation of the SDR. The IMF
further revised the ourrency basket effective
1 January 1981 by reducing the number of currencies
from 16 to 5. The adjustments made at the time of the
changes were such that the value of the revised
baskets In terms of any currency was exactly the
same under both the then existing and the revised
valuations. As of 31 December 1983, the vaiue of the
SDR in terms of the United States dollar was
$1.04695 ($1.10311 — 1982) giving a value for each
share of the Bank’s capltal equlyafent to $40,469.50
($11,031.10 — 1982),

holdings of member currencies in terms of 1986
dollars, in accordance with the provisons of Article
25 of its Articles and relevant resolutions of the
Board of Directors. The “Amounts required to maintain value of currency holdings” under “AMOUNTS
RECEIVABLE FROM MEMBERS” represent the aggregate amounts receivable resulting fram changes
in exchange rates of member currencies from those
previously used for the purpose of computing
maintenance of vaiue of the Bank’s holdings of certain member currencies (See Note D).

Since 1 April 1978, inasmuch as the vaijuation of the
Bank’s capital stock and the basis of determining
possible maintenance of value obligations are still
under consideration, notional amounts. have been
calculated provisionally as receivable from or payable to members in order to maintain the value of curtency holdings in terms of the SDR. The timing of any
establishment and settlement of such amounts is
uncertain. The notional amounts as of 31 December
1983 consisting of receivables of $112,277,000
($86,133,000 —.1982) and payables of $92,531,000
{$52,172,000 — 1882} represent (a) the net decrease of
$204,458,000 ($152,592,000 — 1982) in the value of
currency holdings in relation to ‘the United States
dollar, the Bank's unit of account, during the period
from 1 April 1878 to 31 December 1983, offset by (6)
the decrease of $184,712,000 ($118,.631,000 — 1982)

Total interest expense incurred amounted to
$239,573,000 ($190,517,000 — 14982). Of this amount
$537,000 (nil — 1982) were capitalized as a part of the
cost of the proposed new headquarters building.

Administrative expenses are net of an Administration Charge to the Asian Development Fund amounting to $35,690,000 ($27,410,000 — 1982). The charge
is presently based on a formula which takes into consideration all administrative expenses (other than
those appertaining directly to ordinary operations
and special operations) and the number of joans approved.

NOTE G —

SPECIAL RESERVE

In accordance with Articles 16 and 17, the Bank
charges a commission calculated at one per cent per
annum on the outstanding amount of loans made by
it from the ordinary capital resources and an amount
equivaient to such commissions is appropriated to a
Special Reserve. Special Reserve Fund assets consist of government and government guaranteed
obligations {time deposits and certificates of deposit
— 1982).

making provision for reserves, to surplus and what

The Bank has a contributory Staff Retirement Plan
(the Plan). Every employee, as defined under the Plan,
shail, as a condition of service, become a participant
as of the first day of service, provided that as of suchAPPENDIX 1-VII

 

   

a date, the employee shall not have reached the normal retirement date. The Plan applies also to
members of the Board of Directors who elect to join
the Plan. The Staff Retirement Plan assets are
segregated and held in trust and are not included in
the accompanying balance sheet. Al! costs of administering the Plan are absorbed by the Bank.

From December 1974, participants have contributed
9 4/3 per cent of their remuneration to the Plan, and
the Bank has contributed amounts equal to 18 2/3 per
cent of the participants’ remuneration. The Bank’s
contribution is determined at a rate sufficient to
cover that part of the costs of the Plan not covered by
the participants’ contributions. For the year ended
34 December 1983, the amount contributed by the
Bank was $5,980,000 ($5,214,000 — 1982).

The actuarial present vajue of vested and non-vested
accumulated plan benefits as of 30 September 1983,
the date of the last actuarial valuation, totalled
$36,870,000 ($29,259,000 — 1982) and $2,301,000
$2,949,000 — 1982}, respectively. Net assets
available for benefits totalled $62,643,000 as of
30 September 1983 ($42,785,000 — 1982). The

     

weighted average assumed rate of return used in
determining the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits was 8 per cent.

NOTE K —
SERVICES TO MEMBER COUNTRIES

The Bank’s outstanding commitments for technical
assistance projects and programs totalled approximately $24,840,000 as of 31 December 1983
($17,015,000 — 1982}; to the extent available, contributions to the Technical Assistance Special Fund
may be used to meet expenditures arising out of the
commitments. The amount shown is exclusive of
technical assistance services made available on a
reimbursable basis; however, when technical
assistance rendered as a part of the commitment
shown leads to loans for specific projects, the portion representing the cost of design and engineering
and any remaining balance over $150,000 will be converted to the subsequent loan. Under such options,
technical assistance expenditures of $62,000 were
charged to loans and credited to income of ordinary
capital resources during the year ended 31 December
4983 ($31,000 — 1982).122

GENERAL

(a) The Asian Development Fund (the Fund) was
established on 28 June 1974 to streamline special
operations of the Bank,

(b) The initia! contributions of three contributors are
restricted as to their initial use to procurement of
goods and services from their respective countries.
As of 31 December 1983, the unused portions of such
contributions were equivalent to US$32,971,00G
{US$38,988,000 — 1982).

(c) The resources of the Fund have been subsequently
augmented by three repienishments, the most recent
of which was in July 1982 in a total amount
equivalent to US$3,214,073,000 to cover the operational requirements for the four years ending
31 December 1986,

NOTE 2 —
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a} Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of contributing members are functional currencies. The reporting gurrency is the
United States dollar, and the financial statements
are expressed in thousands of current United States
dollars.

(b)  Transiation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities and contributions committed are
translated from their functional currencies to the
reporting currency generally at the applicable rates
of exchange at the end of a reporting period. income
and expense amounts are transtated for each semimonthly period (quarterly period — 1982) generally at
the applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of

each period; such practice approximates the applica- .

{c)

tion of average rates in effect during the period.
Translation adjustments relating to contributions are
offset by increases or decreases in the contribution
accounts. Translation adjustmenis relating to
capital set-aside (see Note 6) are recorded as
receivable from or payable to’ Ordinary Capital
Resources. Other translation adjustments are
charged or credited to “Accumulated translation adjustments”. Exchange gains or losses on currency
transactions are included in income.

Contributions

Contributions by member countries are included in
the financial statements as amounts committed from
the date Instruments of Contribution are deposited
and related formalities are completed.

NOTE 3 —

INVESTMENTS

As of 31 December 1983, the market value of investments was $400,095,000 ($443,538,000 — 1982),
including investments not traded in the market (time
deposits, etc.) which were valued at their cost or
amortized cost of $277,741,000 ($317,659,000 —
1982}. During the year ended 31 December 1983, sales
of investments resulted in a net loss of $397,000 (net
gain of $365,000 — 1982}. Gains and losses on sales
of investments are measured by the difference between average amortized cost and the net proceeds
of sales. The annualized rate of return on the average
investments held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the end of each quarter, including realized gains and losses, was 9.54% (14.17% — 1982}.

NOTE 4 —

LOANS

Loans negotiated after 1 January 1983 are
denominated in Speciai Drawing Rights (SDR) for the
purpose of commitment whereas loans negotiated

before that date were denominated in current United
States dollars for the same purpose.

NOTE 5 —

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND’
ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

Administrative expenses Include an Administration
Charge from Ordinary Capital Resources amounting
to $35,690,000 ($27,410,000 — 1982 ). The charge Is
presently based on a formula which takes into consideration ali administrative expenses (other than
those appertaining directiy to ordinary operations
and special operations) and the number of loans
approved.

NOTE 6 —

SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

Pursuant to the provisions of Articte 19, paragraph
1(l), the Board of Governors has authorlzed the setting aside of 10 per cent of the unimpaired “pald-in”
capital pald by members pursuant to Article 6,
paragraph 2(a) and the convertible currency portion
paid by members pursuant to Article 8, paragraph
2{b) as of 28 April 1973, to be used as part of the
Speclal Funds of the Bank. The capltal. so set aside
was allocated and transferred from the Ordlnary

APPENDIX 1-6

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK — ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND

 
      

Capital Resources to the Fund as Set-Aside
Resources.

The capital stock of the Bank is defined In Article 4,
paragraph { of the Articles of Agreement “in terms of
Unlted States dollars of the weight and fineness in
effect on 31 January 1866" (the 1966 dollar).
Therefore, Set-Aside Resources had historically been
transiated Into the current United States doliar {the
Bank's unit of account), on the basis of its par value
in terms of gold. From 1973 until 31 March 1978, the
rate arrived at on this basis was $1.20635 per 1966
dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at which time the Second
Amendment to the Articies of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect, currencies no longer have par values in terms of gold.
The Bank is examining the implications of this
change on the valuation of its capital stock but has
not made a decision on the matter. Pending such a
decision, the Set-Aside Resources has been valued
for purposes of the accompanying financial
statements in terms of the Special Drawing Right
(SDR), at the value In current United States doilars as
computed by the IMF. As of 31 December 1983, the
SDR was vatued at $1,04695 ($1.10311 — 1982}, On
this basis, Set-Aside Resources amounted to
$49,845,000 ($52,519,000 — 1982). If the capltal stock
as of 31 December 1983 had been valued In terms of
$12,083.50 per share, Set-Aside Resources would
have been $57,434,000,DELOITTE HASKINS .& SELLS

we considered necessary in the circumstances.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly the financial position of the Asian Development Bank — Asian Development Fund at 34 December 1983 and 31 December 1982 and the results

of its operations and the changes in its financial position for the years then ended, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currency and Reporting Currency

The functional currency of the Technical Assistance
Special Fund {TASF) is deemed, as a matter of convenience, to be the same as the reporting currency, the
United States dollar. The financial statements of
TASF are expressed in thousands of current United
States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities and unexpended balances in currencies other than United States dollars are
translated at the applicable rates of exchange at the
end of a reporting period. As to contributions committed, the used portions have been translated at the
applicable exchange rates as of the respective dates
of use whereas the unused portions are translated at
the applicable exchange rates as of the end of a
reporting period, income and expense amounts in
currencies other than United States dollars are
translated for each semi-monthly period (quarterly
period — 1982) generally at the applicable rates of
exchange at the beginning of each period; such practice approximates the application of average rates in
effect during the period. Translation adjustments are
accounted for as exchange gains or losses and are
charged or credited to operations.

Contributions
Coniributions by member countries are included in

the financial! statements as amounts committed from
the date contribution agreements become effective,

NOTE 2 —

INVESTMENTS

As of 31 December 1983, the market: value of jinvestments was $14,968,000 ($15,151,000 —- 1982), in
 

 

 

cluding investments not traded in the market (time
deposits, etc.) which were vaiued at their cost or
amortized cost of $12,308,000 ($11,396,000 — 14982).
During the year ended 31 December 1983, sales of investments resulted in a net gain of $20,000 ($1,000 —
1982). Gains and losses on sales of investments are
measured by the difference between average amortized cost and the net proceeds of sales. The annualized rate of return on the average investmenis
held during the year, based on the portfolio held at
the end of each quarter, including realized gains and
losses, was 7.88% (8.58% — 1982).

NOTE 3 —
FUNDING

Since 1967, contributions have been made by 26
(25 — 1982) member countries and such contributions have been restricted in. one form or another.
There has been a trend in recent years towards contributions being made in a substantially or wholly
unrestricted manner.

NOTE 4 —
SERVICES TO MEMBER COUNTRIES

The Bank’s outstanding commitments for technical
assistance projects and programs totalled approximately $24,840,000 as of 31 December 1983
{$17,015,000 — 1982); to the extent available, contributions to the TASF may be used to meet expenditures arising out of the commitments. The amount
shown is exclusive of technical assistance services
made available on a reimbursable basis; however,
when technical assistance rendered as a part of the
commitment shown leads to loans for specific projects, the portion representing the cost of design and
engineering and any remaining balance over
$150,000 will be canverted to the subsequent loan.
Under such options, technical assistance expenditures of $774,000 were charged to loans and credited to income from other sources of the TASF during
the year ended 31 December 1983 ($337,000 — 1982).

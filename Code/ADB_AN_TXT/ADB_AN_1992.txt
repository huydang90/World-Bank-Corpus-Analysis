Te TOTAL of new operations approved during
1992 in both public and private sectors amounted to
$5, 125, million, a 6.6 per cent increase over the
prévious year. } This comprised $5,059 million in government and governmeni-guaranteed loans (an increase
of 10 per cent), including $671.5 million in public sector
loans for private sector developrnent (up 136 per cent). The
remainder comprised $50 million in direct private sector
lending without govemment quarantee (down 73 per cent),
$11 million in four private sector equity investments (down
61 per cent} and $5 million in one equity underwriting.

At year-end, the Bank's, cumulative lending stood at
$42.5 billion ($42 billion in the public sector and
$496.3 million in the private). Equity operations {including
underwritings) totalled $220.5 million.

The year’s total lending volume of $5,109 million

i Tre 1991 tota! operations figure was revised from $5,011.7 million to
$4,808.7 million ozcause of the withdrawal of a $203 million loan to
Meiaysia. The total lending in 1991, thus, was revisee from $4,983.7 million to $4,780.7, million ($4,593.9 million in the public sector and

OVERVIEW

$3,954 million from ordinary capital resources (OCR),
which was an increase of 15 per cent, and $1,155 million
from the concessional Asian Development Fund {ADF},
down 14 per cent.

By lending modality, project loans accounted for
$3,202 million (63 per cent) of the total lending volume and
showed a 5 per cent increase from 1991. Secior loans
amounted to $1,074 million (21 per cent of the total), an
increase of 62 per cent. Program loans, aggregating
$580 million, represented 11 per cent of the total and
showed a 33 per cent increase. Of the rest, credit lines
amounted to $196.5 million (down 56 per cent), technical
assistance loans $6.4 million and unguaranteed private
sector loan $50 million (down 73 per cent),

The lending growth in 1992 resulted mainly from a
marked increase in both sector loans and project loans
meant for disaster rehabilitation. Five developing member
countries (DMCs) were provided emergency assistance
amounting to $161 million for disaster rehabilitation, which
was about six times the previous year’s figure of $29 million.

The decline in concessionary lending was temporary
and reflected in part the coming into office of new
governments in several ADF-borrowing countries and the
need for the Bank to reestablish dialogue with them.

The three-year moving average share (1990- 1992) of
program lending was 13.5 per cent.

official sources (up 289 per cent over the previous year),
$746 million from export credits (up 5 per cent) and
$272 million from commercial sources (up 53 per cent).

The net transfer of resources to the DMCs
(disbursements minus capital repayments, payments of interest and other charges, plus equity investments) decreased
by 28 per cent to $1,179 million.

Loan disbursements decreased 11 per cent to
$2,767 million, of which OCR disbursements amounted to

$1,880 million and ADF disbursements $887 million, down
9 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively,

The decline was due mainly to the fact that
extraordinary disbursements had been made under Special
Assistance, Gulf Crisis Assistance and Cyclone Assistance
projects in 1991, which had inflated that year’s figures.
Disbursements in 1992 were also affected by a slower
progress in project implementation.

Seventy-five projects were completed during the year,
bringing the total number of completed projects to 740 out
of 1,103 projects approved as of end-1992. Posi-evaluation
was made of 28 projects, including two program loans. The
26 other projects were in 12 subsectors in 12 DMCs, and
included the first ever post-evaluation of a private sector
project financed without government guarantee.

On 31 December 1992, the Bank’s authorized
capital amounted to $23,224 million (SDR 16,890 million), of which $23,100 million (SDR 16,800 million) was
subscribed.

Ten borrowings were undertaken during the year for
a total of $3,049.7 million. Of these, nine were to raise
$2,556.3 million in new money under the Bank's indicative
borrowing program, including its first public bond issue inHong Kong dollars. The remaining transaction was to raise
$493.4 million equivalent to finance the prepayment of the
three outstanding callable yen bond issues. The Bank
returned to the Dutch guilder market in June after being
absent from that market since 1986. A second "Dragon"
bond issue (Asian region US dollar public bond issue} was
made in October.

The average life (weighted by amount) of the year’s
borrowings was 9.73 years. compared to 9.39 years in
1991. The “after swap” average cost of the funds raised
(excluding refinancing) declined to 5.86 per cent per amum
from 6.8 per cent per annum in the previous year. At the
end of 1992, OCR investments amounted to
$5,234 million, against $4,331 million a year ago. The
realized rate of return on OCR investments was
7.8 per cent, compared with 9.1 per cent in 1991.

Net income for the year came io $535 million, an
increase of 3.2 per cent from the previous year.

The fifth Asian Development Fund replenishment
(ADF VI) came into effect in August when the total amount
of unqualified contribution commitments received by the
Bank exceeded the specified trigger of $2,100 million.

THE BOARDS

BOARD OF GOVERNORS

The Bank is governed by a Board of 52 Governors
representing the 36 regional member countries and 16
non-regional members.

The Board of Governors is vested, under Article 28 of
the Bank’s Charter, with all the powers of the Bank. In tum,
except for certain powers reserved to it under the Bank's
Charter, the Governors have delegated its authority to the
Board of Directors.

The Board of Governors meet in formal session once a
year at the Bank’s Annual Meeting. The Twenty-Fifth
Annuai Meeting of the Board of Governors was held in Hong
Kong from 4 to 6 May 1992.

In 1992 the Govemors of the’ Bank approved the fifth
replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (ADF VI) and
tae Second Regularized Repienishment of the Technical
Assistance Special Fund. They also approved a reallocation
of $50 million from the surplus from 1991 net income io
the Technical Assistance Special Fund.

The membership of the Board of Governors is shown
in Appendix 3.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The Bank’s Charter provides for the Governors to elect
a Board of 12 Directors, with each Director appointing an
Alternate. The Board of Directors is responsible for policy
direction and general operations of the Bank. The Board
performs‘its duties on a full-time basis at the Bank's Headquarters in Manila and meets in regular formal sessions
under the chairmanship of the Bank’s President.

The members of the Board of Directors and the
countries they represent are shown in Appendix 4.

Operations

The Board held 49 formal meetings in 1992 and
approved a total lending and investment program of $5,125
million. This comprised 72 government-guaranteed loans
and private sector loans and investmenis. Either directly or
through the authority delegated to the President, the Board
approved 265 technical assistance grants to the value of

“$107.5 million.

in 1992 the Board approved its first loan to Cambodia
since 1970, a $67.7 million loan from the Asian
Devélopment Fund for Special Rehabilitation Assistance.

Policy Issues

The Board continued to be directly involved with
strategic planning within the Bank. It sees planning as an
important tool in allocating human and financial resources
to meet the Bank’s changing priorities and to better meet
the development needs of the Bank's DMCs. In this context
in 1992 the Board, in informal sessions, discussed the
Bank's Operational Program for 1992-1994, the MediumTerm Strategy, the Three-Year Rolling Work Plan (19931995) with Budget Implications and the review of Bank
Operations and Country Performance.

During the year the Board held a series of seminars with
Management on a range of policy issues, including Environmental Review and Impact Assessment Requirement, the
Report of the Private Sector Task Force, the tindings of the
Inter-departmenial Review Committee on Technical
Assistance Operations and the Guidelines for Social Analysis
of Development Projects. These seminars provided an opportunity for the Board to make a direct input into these
policy and administrative issues at an early stage of their
formulation.

In 1992 the Board commence preliminary work on a
general capital increase (GCI IV}. The Board considered four
working papers covering projected OCK operations during
1993-1997, resource imptications of the Bank's projected
future lending. arm operatione! agenda for 1994-1998 and
the modalities for the capital increase.

Board Committees 
The Budget Review Committee has been established to
enhance the effectiveness of the Board in discharging its
responsibilities in respeci of the Bank’s annual administrative budget. It'meets over a two-week period in November,
and reviews the assumptions and priorities underlying the
proposed expenditures.

In 1992 the Committee recommended that the Board
approve a Budget for 1993 authorizing administrative
expenditure of $161.9 million, an increase of about
14.2 per cent over the actual 1992 expenditure.

The Audit Commitiee met on 15 occasions during
1992. It assessed the activities of the Bank’s Internal Audit
Office and reviewed, with the external auditors, the 1991
Financial Statements. The Committee worked closely with
the Post-Evaluation Office and discussed its work program
for the year. It reviewed 17 project performance and other
evaluation reports. In July each year, the Committee submits

 

KIMIMASA TARUMIZU, Chairman, Board of Directors.

its annual report for the preceding year to the Board of
Directors,

Appendix 5 shows the membership of the Budget

Directors’ Group Visits

Two groups of Board members visited four of the
Bank’s developing member countries. In February seven
Board members visited India and in August a further group
visited Fiji, Kiribati and Papua New Guinea. These were the
first occasions Board members had’visited either India or
Kiribati. The objective of the group visits is for Board
members to obtain a better appreciation of the Bank's
operations, members’ priorities and constraints and to
inspect Bank projects. The visits also offer Board members
an opportunity to discuss policy and development issues with
the authorities of the host countries’: {amounits in $ million). :

a Figure adjusted to avoid double counting.JHE TRENDS

IEN THE Bank was established in 1966, the
Ws and Pacific region was primarily rural. Since
then, there has been a marked increase in the
proportion of populations in the region living in urban areas.
This wend is expected to continue. The dynamic forces
generated by metropolitan areas throughout the world are
fundamental te development. Such areas are centers of
economic, social, technological and political influence. By
the year 2020, about half the world’s urban population will
be in this region. This massive growth in urban populations
has resulted in significant impacts on the Bank's developing
member countries (DMCs}.

The shift from agrarian to urban-based economies is
one of the major changes affecting many DMCs today,
resulting in a reorientation of development plans and
priorities. Since increasing urbanization is a normal process
of economic development, DMCs and the Bank must work
together to make this growth sustainable, efficient and
equitable. The challenge of sustainable development in the
twenty-first century will be posed in a predominantly urban
Asia-Pacific region. Actions that will be required include
providing adequate infrastructure to support urban-based

economic growth, addressing urban poverty, improving the ©

urban environment and strengthening urban management.
These have major implications for the Bank's strategic
objectives of: (i} promoting economic growth; (ii) reducing
poverty; (ili) improving the status of women; (iv) developing
human resources, including population planning; and
{v) sound management of natural resources and the
environment.

Dimensions of Urbanization

Urban areas of all sizes have important roles to play;
hence urban policy should not necessarily concentrate on
any specific city size. Urban areas can be grouped into three
broad categories: (i) towns; {ii} intermediate and secondary
cities; and (tii) large cities or metropolitan areas, including
megacities. Towns and intermediate and secondary cities
have increasingly important roles es links with rural areas
(e.g. providing markets for agricultural products. services to
tural consumers and off-farm employment). Metropolitan

CHALLENGES OF
URBANIZATION IN THE
ASIA-PACIFIC REGION

areas, with populations in excess of 1 million, are
characterized by their size, high concentration of formal and
inforrnal economic activity and, m some cases, proliferation
of slums. Megacities are generally defined as metropolitan
areas with populations of 10 million or more. The definition
of “urban” areas varies from country to country, as does the
quality of statistical data. For example, int India, urban is
defined to include communities of 5,000 or more, while in
Malaysia, the cut-off figure is 10,000. The following analysis
reflects the definitions of “urban” areas adopied in various
DMCs. Despite deficiencies in data quality, broad trends are
clearly discernible (see Figure 1).

Urbanization is a global phenomenon although the
degree of urbanization and rate of urban growth vary in
different parts of the world. In 1990, about 45 per cent of
the world's population was classified as urban. The proportion was higher in the more developed regions (73 per cent)
than in the less developed regions (37 per cent). Between
1960 and 1990, the Asian and Pacific region's urban
population grew ai a rate of about 3.9 per cent per year,
reaching about 849 million. This growth, equivalent to about
19 million new urban residenis being added every year,
accelerated during the 1970s and 1980s. During the next
30 years, the urban population in the Bank's DMCs is
expected to grow by about 3.3 per cent per annum and
exceed 2 billion by the year 2020.

In 1990, about 30 per cent of the Asian and Pacific
region’s population lived in urban areas, as compared to
18 per cent in 1960. The region, however, is less urbanized
than North America (75 per cent), Europe (73 per cent} and
Latin America (72 per cent), and has about the same level
of urbanization as Africa (34 per cent). By the year 2020,
about half the people in the Bank’s DMCs wili be living in
urban areas. The rate, magnitude and character of urbaniza
- tion differ among DMCs {see Table). Excluding Hong Kong

and Singapore, which are city states, over 40 per cent of
the populations of Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mongolia
and Philippines five in urban areas. In nine other countries,
over a quarter of the populations are urban. Fourteen other
DMCs presently nave less than one quarier of their
populations residing in urban areas. By the year 2020,
virtually all DMCs are expected to have an uroanization level
of more than 25 per cent. .

Source: Based on the Bank's Key Indicators of Developing Asian and Pacific Countrles and the United Nation’s World Urbanizationvillages to a world of cities and towns. The number of large
cities has been increasing. in 1950, there were only 19 cities
in the region with a population of 1 million or more.? By
1970, there were 49, and, by 1990, 86 cities were classified
as metropolitan areas. Most of these were in the People’s
Republic of China (38) and India (24). By the end of the
century, 12 of the 21 megacities in the world will be in this
region. Bombay, Calcutta and Shanghai will each have more
than 15 million residents and the populations of nine other
cities will exceed 10 million. While most of the attention has
been focused on the high growth rates of megacities, the
process of urbanization has affected cities and towns of all
sizes. Many other cities in the region are major metropolises
with populations in excess of 3 million and most are growing

rapidly.
Contributory Factors

Both natural population growth and rural-urban
migration have contributed to the rapid growth in urban
populations in the Asian and Pacific region. During 19701990, natural population increases accounted for about
55 ver cent of the region's urban growth. Rural-urban
migration accounted for the remaining 45 per cent.
However, the situation differs from country to country.
Natural growth accounted for more than half the urban
population increases in India, Malaysia, Pakistan,
Philippines and Viet Nam. Rural-urban migration has been
the dominant factor in countries such as Bangladesh,
Peopie’s Republic of China, Indonesia, Republic of Korea
and Thailand. While policy makers have tended to focus on
rural-urban migration, the rate of natural population
increase is also an important contributor to increased
urbanization.

People move to urban areas because of expectations
that cities can provide better employment opportunities and
higher incomes. There is also the hope that cities will offer
better services (e.g. health, education, administrative
facilities’ and finance), and a greater access to information
and culture. In some DMCs, poverty, inadequate employment opportunities, lack’of land tenure, reduced demand for
labor resulting from mechanization and higher agricultural
productivity, and pressures on environmental resources also
contribute to rural-urban migration

Urbanization is closely associated with a shift from
agriculture to nonagricultural employment. In the long ier,
urbanization will only be sustainable if the expectations of
better standards of living are met. Although there are some
exceptions, in most DMCs the rate of nonagricultural job
creation has either exceeded or just about equaled the rate
of urban population increase during the 1970-1990 perio¢
(see Figure 2). The raie of nonagriculturai job creation
exceeded that of urbanization in Malaysia, People’s Repuolic

of China, Republic of Korea and Taipei,China, where the
majority of people migrating to cities tended to be better off.
In Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand, the two rates were
roughly in balance. In India, Pakistan and Viet Nam, nonagriculturai job creation lagged behind urban population
increase. If the latter trend continues, urban unemployment
would be expected to increase substantially, the expectations
of migrants would not be met and eventually the current rate
of urban migration could prove to be unsustainable.

While urban settlement patterns have varied across
countries, efforts to significantly restrain migration or urban
growth have largely proven io be unsuccessful. For example,
despite sirict controls on migration to cities in the People’s
Republic of China, the country’s urban population has
grown rapidly. Even in countries, such as Malaysia and
Republic of Korea, where rura. development has deen
successtui. rural-urban migration has continued. Rural!
developmen often results in @ substitution of capitat for
labor, which facilitates rural-urban migration. Because of
these factors, urban populaiion in ine region is increasing

asa share of total population. To an extent, the development
of secondary cities and smaller metropolitan areas
{e.g. Taegu in the Republic of Korea, Medan in Indonesia
and Cebu in the Philippines) can brake the migration to
megacities. Creation of employment opportunities in such
areas must also be accompanied by investment in social
infrastructure. The short-term impact of such measures in
modifying the pattern of urban growth is, however, small.
In general, the prospects of higher incomes in urban areas
will, in the minds of migrants, continue to outweigh the
assurance of food and shelter in rural areas. Often, it is rural
males who first migrate to cities in search of jobs; wives and
families follow. The split in the family unit is one of the
hidden social costs of rural-urban migration. Once a city
migrant finds a job, usually a considerable part of the salary
is sent to family members back in the rural areas. Such
transfers are an important source of cash income for the
rural poor,

The forces that are driving migration from rural to urban
areas are so fundamental — essentially, it is a matter of
searching for a better life — that the impact of individual
projects on the rate of rural-urban migration is not likely to
be measurable. Rather, the emphasis should be put on broad
policies that determine the "terms of trade” between urban
and rural areas fo ensure that pricing distortions do not
unintentionally encourage migration. For primary

     

 

commodities such as rice, wheat and other rural products,
policies should ensure that the prices are market-oriented
and are not artificially controlled at low levels to the detriment of rural producers. Rather than distorting the prices of
food for all consumers and producers, alternative ways
should be developed to make food affordable to the urban
poor. Policies that favor wide-scale food subsidies for urban
residents have generally proven not to be fiscally sustainable.
Such policies are being phased out, for example, in People’s
Republic of China and Pakistan. User charges for urban
services should reflect the cost of providing these services,
inchiding the cost of addressing environmental problems.
Exchange rate policies may also affect the terms of trade
between urban and rural areas. If government policies are
designed to maintain an overvalued currency, imports will
be encouraged and exports discouraged, and imports are
largely consumed in urban areas. A market-oriented
exchange rate policy, on the other hand, would encourage
a greater production of agricultural products for export in
countries having a competitive advantage in agriculture.
Because of their wide impact, policies designed to ensure
market-oriented terms of trade between urban and rural
areas should be pursued and distortions that affect
rural-urban migration should ‘be removed. This would
encourage wealth to be distributed between the rural and
urban areas in an equitable and efficient manner.

Urban Areas and Economic Performance

All industrial countries have passed through the transition from rural to urban-based economies and many Bank
DMCs are having the same experience. Cities are the centers
of economic growth and manufacturing. Because large cities
provide the transport, communications, trade and business
linkages between the domestic economy and international
markets, they tend to be the incubators of novation. Cities
play an important role in disseminating technical information and new ideas which are essential to economic
development. While some urban economic activities are
large-scale (e.g. modem factories and banking), small-scale
private businesses (e.g. small retail stores and distribution
Gealerships) are the foundation of most urban economies.

Despite the many difficulties associated with urbanization (e.g. overloaded infrastructure, traffic congestion and
pollution), there is a close correlation between higher
incomes and the degree of urbanization (see Figure 3). In
most DMCs, urban areas generate over half their measured
national economic outputs and raise three quarters of the
national taxes. During the 1990s, about 80 per cent of the
region's economic growth will come from its urban
economies. By the turn of the century. about two thirds of
its national output will be generated in cities. Because of the
hi productivity of urban economies end economies of

 

  

 

scale, cities are able to gerierate goods and services far in
excess of their share of the national population. For
example, in the Philippines, the National Capital Region,
which accounts for about 14 per cent of total population,
contributes about a third of the country’s gross domestic
product (GDP). Similarly, the 6 per cent of Pakistanis living
in Karachi generate 15 per cent of Pakistan's GDP. Jakarta,
with 5 per cent of the total population, accounts for
11 per cent of Indonesia’s GDP. This emphasizes the need
to ensure that policies are in place that encourage productivity and economic efficiency in urban economies.

‘Urban and rural development are complementary.
Sirengthening linkages.between urban centers and rural
areas is necessary to ensure that the two remain mutually
reinforcing. Towns and cities provide markets for rural
products and jobs to absorb surplus rural labor. If marketing
systems are improved for both agricultural products and
inputs, production, employment and the scope for private
enterprise in rural areas and cities can be increased. Efficient
infrastructure, services and facilities can facilitate complementary rurai-urban development which normally results
in a diversification and commercialization of rurai
economies. If properly strengthened, the rural-urban
dynamics can help ensure that investments in services
(e.g. financial, legal, medical), facilities. infrastructure
(e.g. efficient transport, good communications) and

Box 1: Paying for Urban Water Supply

A= to potable water is essential for urban life. Based on the Bank’s experience, cost-effective and sustainable
water supply in cities is most often achieved through autonomous agencies which operate ina financially
self-sustaining manner. Where governments have provided them with greater autonomy, water utilities have responded
by improving efficiency and levels of cost recovery in a manner equitable for the urban poor.

Tariff Setting: The Bank advocates that tariffs should be set to recover the full costs from users in order to
encourage efficient resource use. Because potable water is a basic human need, however, ways must be found to
balance cost recovery with equitable access. This may require some cross-subsidization from one class of consumers

to another, In Indonesia, Philippines and Sri Lanka, utilities

have made regular tariff increases while protecting the
interests of low income consumers through: ()) affordable.

prices for community stand-pipe supplies; {ii) life-line rates for
low income groups; (iii) higher rates for those consuming near

the average; and (iv) higher tariffs for high consumption.

For example, in Colombo there ‘is a ‘large differential
between the life-line and higher tariff rates (see Chart 1). In

Indonesia, with Bank assistance, the Semarang Water,

Enterprise simplified the tariff structure while ensuring that low
income consumers paid between 2 and 3 per cent of their
average monthly household income for water: In the
Philippines, demand managernerit is being pursued through
punitive tariffs on excessive consumption:

Operational Efficiency: The Bank promotes the pursuit of operating efficiency. This has been demonstrated in a
dramatic reduction in the proportion of total water which is
not paid for (non-revenue water) in Bangkok (see Chart 2),

Financial Management: Efficient collection of..

revenues is also required to achieve good financial perfor
' mance. In Bangkok, where the Bank has been actively involved since 1973 by providing loans totalling $218.5. million,

bee impressive gains have been made in billing and collection. Accounts receivable have been reduced to the equivalent .
i of 0.31 months of sales. This has contributed to an improved financial performance, as shown in Chart 3.

THE CHALLENGES

Despite the fact that they contribuie significantly to
economic development and have relatively higher labor and
capital productivity, cities — especially large cities —~
generally experience significant problems with regard to
infrastructure and services, environment and urban management, The challenge facing DMCs is how to manage these
problems on a sustainable basis and to improve conditions
so that city economies can offer better living standards for
their residents. This will require massive, sustained and
coordinated efforts well into the next century.

Because of the demographic trends outlined above and
the fact that urban economies are an important source of
economic growth, policymakers need to pay increasing
attention to the economic dimensions of urbanization.
Necessary policies must be developed at both national and
local levels to enhance the productivity and efficiency of
urban economies in a manner that facilitates an equitable
distribution of wealth. There is a need for a better understanding of the impact of macroeconomic policies and
instruments on urban economies and the pace‘and pattem
of urbanization. Effective fiscal, monetary and pricing
policies can contribute to a complementary urban-rural
development. Appropriaie tax and incentive programs
encourage domestic savings, assist in developing financial
markets and foster private sector investment. Industrial
incentives and health and education facilities enhance urban
development.

Infrastructure and Services

In many cities in the region, inadequate infrastructure
has resulted in economic inefficiencies. limiting the productivity of firms and households. For example, production is
constrained by electricity shortages in Manila, traffic congestion impedes the efficient movement of goods and services
in Bangkok and insufficient water supply is affecting
industrial development in Karachi. While many types of
urban infrastructure are required to support economic
growth, two — water supply and urban transport — deserve
special mention.

Safe water includes treated water or untreated but
uncontaminated water from springs, wells and bore holes.
In all countries in the region, except Bangladesh, Pakistan,
Thailand. Tonga, Vanuatu anc Western Samoa, the
proportion of rura! residents with access to safe ¢rinking
water is higher than the proportion cf urban residents. Rapid

 

CHALLENGES OF URBANIZATI

 

IX THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION
oe

   

urbanization and industrialization make major demands on
water resources. Water-related problems in large cities
include low reliability of supply, poor quality, inadequate
access io piped water and little provision for waste-water
disposal. Although many cities in the region have made
major investments to improve water supply and sanitation
(e.g. Bandung, Bangkok, Incheon, Mandalay and Manila),
there will be a continuing need to develop appropriate
strategies, programs and plans to manage water resources
and increase water supplies. Two issues which are of
particular concem to the Bank in this respect are to ensure
the sustainability of projects through adequate financial
performance and cost recovery, and to make the urban
poor's access to potable water equitable {see Box 1).

Rapid urbanization and industrialization make major
demands .on water resources. To cater for increasing
demand, DMCs are having to tap water resources farther
and farther away from urban centers. This not only results
in higher costs but also involves making a choice between
uses of water for drinking, industry, hydropower generation
and irrigation. The experience in Bangkok indicates that
high-density urban agglomerations and potential megacities,
more than others, are often required to adopt an integrated
planning approach to optimize resource use. Under such
circumstances, DMCs would need to consider suitable
pricing mechanisms to manage demand and rationalize the
allocation of water among competing uses. .

Traffic congestion is common to most large cities in the
region. Cornmercial activity is disrupted as time is spent
inefficiently, vehicles consume additional fuel, their
operating costs increase and air poilution levels rise. Adding
to these problems are increases in vehicle fleets, with consequent increases in the number of traffic accidents. While
demand management fo cope with these problems has
proven to be effective in Singapore, it has been difficult to
implement in other cities. To address these issues, transport
policy should be directed towards three principal objectives:
(i) integrating land use and transport development;
(ii) maximizing the use of existing road space; and
(iii) improving the performance of public transport. Traffic
management and engineering, the ownership, franchising
and regulation of public transport, and transport tariffs and
user charges are issues that must be dealt with. The
experience ir. Bangkok indicates that, if appropriate policies
are adopied, private sector capital can be mobilized to help
alleviate urban transport consiraints (see Box 2). In some
large cities (e.g. Beijing, Calcutta, Manila. Hong Kong,
Singapore), mass transit systems have been developed to
provide a high capacity, efficient service for corarnuters.
While it is a fact that the mass rapid transit systems in the
region are not yet able io fully recover their operating and
capital costs from passenger fares, increased land vaiues
resulting from the construction of such systems provide a
potential source of indirect revenue to recover some of the
investment costs.

2] aSBox 2: Easing Traffic in Bangkok

hailand’s. rapid economic.growth during the 1980s — about 7.7 Per cent per annum in real terms ‘has placed
“@ great strains on Bangkok's road transport. The Bangkok Metropdlitan Area generates 53 per cent of the natiorial
economic output and has a population of about 8:9 million. Large increases in vehicle ownership, one of the
consequences of economic growth, have inéreased traffic volumés beyond the optimal capacity-of the road system.
The serious traffic congestion which has developed as a consequence has economic costs and is adversely affectitig

- the quality of life in the city,

Making Bangkok’s transport more efficient is crucial to Thailand's continued econemic growth. Consequentl

the Government accords high priority to both public and private sector investment in urban transport infrastructtire.
Similarly, the Bank’s operational strategy in Thailand focuses upon the elimination of infrastructure bottlenecks, Within
this strategic framework, the Banik has funded two urban transport projects in Bangkok. cs

Thailand's Government was one of the first in the region to recognize the potential for using private ‘sector
resources to develop transport infrastructure and services, IA 1990, the Bank supported these efforts by helping'to
finance the Bangkok Expressway Company Limited in establishing a 37 km long, elevated Second Stage Expressway

System. The Banik took'Baht 250 million {$10 million equivalent) equity in the company and provided a loan witheuit  *

government guarantee of $30 million. The Project will improve access to and from the central business district aswell
as allow through-city traffic, The first stage will be open to traffic in 1993, By the turn of the century, about 650,000
vehicles per day will be using the Second Stage Expressway.

In 1992, the Bank approved a $70.3 million Idan to finance the Bangkok Urban Transport Project. Thé Projéct's
core component is the construction of a 5.1 km highway, representing the missing link in the Thonburi Road corridor
leading to the central business district. t will also increase the efficiency of land utilization through distributor road
development in the western sector of the City. In addition, advice on traffic management and transport planning will
be provided. When completed in 1997, the highway constructed under the Project will be used by more than 100,000

vehicles per day.

Reducing Urban Poverty

Although the growth of urban economies in the region
is leading to higher incomes and improved welfare for many,
not all urban residents have benefited to the same extent.
Substantial income disparities exist in all cities. Children
constitute a large portion of the urban poor. In most poor
households, wornen have the responsibility for eking out
meager family incomes. Between a quarter and a third of
the urban population in the region are poor. All large cities
have significant proportions of their populations living below
the poverty line. However, during the 198 (Os, countries such
as Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Thailand
made some progress in reducing urban poverty.

Although the incidence of poverty in most countries is
usually greater in rural areas than in urban, there are large
numbers of poor people in all cities in the region. Living
conditions of the urban poor are characterized by
overcrowding, widespread malnutrition, inadequate basic
environmental and sanitary conditions, high incidence of
environment-related diseases and high crime rates, Poverty
in these areas is associated with high fertility, low life
expectancy and high infant moriality. Unless addressed,
urban poverty can be a politically explosive problem, The
growing concern about urban poverty points to the need for
a strategy that will integrate these issues within an urban

development policy framework. A major challenge of
urbanization is to improve economic efficiency and productivity while concurrently reducing poverty, thus facilitating a
more equitable economic growth. Urban development
programs should be targeted to offer income-generating
activities for the poor living in slums and squatter areas while
economic policies should encourage productivity
improvements of the urban labor force, facilitate the
expansion of small-scale enterprises and promote efficiency
in the informal sector,

The informal sector plays a major role in urban
economies and provides employment to a large number of
people. For example, about three-quarters of shelters in
DMCs are constructed in the informal sector, water is often
bought from private vendors or collected from wells and
transportation is provided by informal operators. By
removing constraints on the growth of the informal sector
and improving its performance and Productivity, a significant contribution can be made to urban poverty reduction. Particular attention is required to be paid to the needs
of women when designing livelihood components of urban
development projects. Although women are affected by
urban poverty, the potential for productive employment and
access to necessary social services appear to be greater for
urban women than their rural counterparts.

This broad strategy should be balanced by investments

iniin human resources and social development for the urban
poor. Investment in education, health and population
programs, particularly those designed to be of the greatest
benefit to lower-income groups, produces clear and
substantial economic and developmental retums. Education
helps the individual absorb training better and creates a
productive and adaptable work force. A healthy work force
is more productive and able to make a larger contribution to
the economy. Investment in matemal and child health and
nutrition, and efforts fo encourage smaller families and
greater birth spacing, contribute to healthier and
better-educated children. Basic health and education
programs not only improve the maierial well-being of
children in the short term but also serve to enhance their
income-eaming potential! over time.

Shelter and employment programs targeted at the
urban poor have been successfully implemented in India,
Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand. The living conditions
of the urban poor and their capacity to improve their own
environment depend on inter-related factors such as access
fo adequate housing, security of land tenure and the
availability of housing finance. Providing for adequate
housing can significantly improve the quality of life of the
urban poor (see Box 3}. There is also a need to give the poor
better access to basic urban infrastructure and services, such
as water supply, sanitation and solid waste disposal.

The encouragement of participatory strategies, based
on community self-help and efforts by residents themselves,
together with a better targeting of basic services, affordable
urban land {including land tenure) and revisions to building
codes and standards, can be of help in improving-the lot of
the urban poor. Such a participatory approach should
involve close cooperation with non-govemmental organizations (NGOs) and address the concems and needs of women.
In most developing countries, community-based NGOs play
a crucial role in supplementing government services, supporting the urban poor and facilitating the poor’s access.to
public services. In providing services to the urban poor, the
competing interests of cost recovery and equity must be
balanced. Innovative methods of cost recovery and crosssubsidization can be used to ensure that the urban poor have
access to basic services which are provided in an efficient
manner. If subsidies are required because of equity considerations, they should be targeted and designed to be
explicit, transparent and efficient.

Improving the Urban Environment

Most iarge cities in the region face environmental
probiems arising from poorly managed urban development
and activities. In many countries, environmental degradation
is more severe ir. urban areas than in rural. New approaches
are needed to ensure that urban environments are
preserved. restored and protected. Planning.and guiding
urbanization in a manner that safeguards existing

  

SIA-PACIFIC REGION

environmental resources and minimizes environmental
degradation is essential.

Urban growth increases pressures on the natural
environment. Inadequate infrastructure and inefficient urban
and environmental management can cause severe depletion
of land and water resources and serious pollution of land,
water and air. Indicators commonly used io measure air
quality are levels of carbon monoxide, suspended particles,
sulfur dioxide and lead. A survey of 56 cities throughout the
world, conducted as part of the Global Environment
Monitoring System, found that nine cities in the region were
among the 20 most polluted cities in terms of suspended
particles and 12 in terms of sulfur dioxide. Seven cities —
Beijing, Calcutta, Guangzhou, Manila, Shanghai, Shenyang
and Xien — were among the 20 most polluted cities based

~ on both of these measures of air pollution. Efforts are being

made to address this problem. In cities such as Beijing and
Shanghai, replacing the burning of brown coai with more
environment-friendly methods of heating (e.g. gas,
electricity) and adjusting the price of energy and coal to
encourage more efficient use are producing some positive
results.

By generating diesel smoke, carbon monoxide and lead,
motorized urban transport is a major contributor to air
pollution. Although efforts are being made to improve traffic
management, urban traffic and the number of motor vehicles
are growing rapidly. Mitigating the environmental impact of
urban traffic is a major challenge in all large cities. During
the 1980s, cities such as Bangkok, Jakarta and Seoul have
made progress in reducing the levels of vehicular pollution.
Strategies to address this problem involve removing price
distortions which encourage the use of diesel rather than
gasoline, taking steps to reduce the lead content of gasoline
and the sulphur content of diesel, encouraging the use of
engines which better meet emission standards and
improving inspection and enforcement. The Bank has
undertaken policy dialogue to remove some. of. the. price
distortions for diesel and gasoline in the Philippines and
indonesia and technical assistance has been provided to
determine how the Bank can assist in addressing the
problem of vehicular pollution in Manila.

Some of the most visible environmental ills of urban
areas arise from inadequate solid waste disposal, pollution
of urban waterways and contamination of groundwater
sources due to inadequate sewerage and sanitation facilities.
During the 1980s, some progress was made in. improving
solid waste management and sanitation in countries like
Indonesia, Republic of Korea and Malaysia. However, the
magnitude of water-related urban environmental problems
in the region rernains serious. For example, over-exploitation of fresh groundwater in the southern and eastern parts
of Bangkok-is causing the city fo sink by 5-10 centimeters
a year. In Bangladesh, India. Myanmar, Nepai, Thailand and
Westen Samoa. the percentage of urban residents having
access to potable water declined during the 1980s. Poliution

" Box 3: Housing Squatters in Manila

I. 1986, Noa and Lucy Fabillar moved to Manila from Dumaguete City in the southern Philippine island of Negros
in search of a better life. For the next five years, the Fabillars and their two children lived in a squatter area in the
Manila Port area. Once, their shanty was destroyed by fire and they had to rebuild it.

Today, they are proud owners of a small apartment built under a scheme by the National Housing Authority
({NHA). The five Fabillars — including an aunt — moved into their 22.5 square meter, fourth floor unit in June 1290.
They have to pay a monthly morigage of 275 pesos ($11) in addition to electricity and water charges averaging about
200 pesos a monih. But the extra costs — in the squatter settlement, there was no rent and electricity and water were
frequently obtained from illegal connections — are well worth it, says Mrs. Fabillar. Aside from the security of owning
their own home, “it's much nicer here than in Bunkers (the colloquial name for a squatter area officially known as

These farnilies were provided with lots and were helped in moving their shanties and belongings. Still others chose to
accept assistance to return to their provinces. . :

"Offering squatters a chance to own their own home is the best incentive to ensure the success of a relocation
scheme. Such a scheme at the right location, a very important consideration to the poor, can often encourage people *
to switch from menial work, such as scavenging and even illegal activities, to more productive jobs that also generate
a larger and more regular income,” says B. K. Lee, a Senior Urban Development Specialist with the Bank. He cites
the example of the Vitas housing project, where most of the men work as stevedores,

Squaiters can cause economic and social problems. They tap both power and water through illegal connections.
Congested shanty towns without sewerage or sanitary facilities also pose fire and health hazards. Law and order
problems are also common in such communities. Clearly, moving squatters to affordable housing at the right location
benefits them and the society alike. However, a number of problems explain why only a fraction of Metro Manila’s
estimated 3 million squatters have been rehoused.

On the level of local government, a shortage of funds is a major obstacle. NHA’s request for assistance from PPA
to relocate the squatters from Slip 17 illustrates the problem.

It is also often difficult to persuade squatters to move, “It took us more than six months to persuade those living
at Slip 17 to move," says Eric Archibald, a PPA supervising engineer involved in the relocation. This can be due to a
variety of reasons: an inability to meet mortgage requirements, a reluctance to lose strong community ties; a resistance
to change; or a mistrust of government schemes. .

For their part, the authorities also can experience difficuliy in identifying genuine squatters who are both needy
and likely to make use of the opportunity provided them. The authorities keep master lists of squatters and the local
communities (barangays) also do their part to screen out the “fakes” and help the deserving cases.is destroying fisheries in areas near Jakarta, Manila and
Seoul. Mosi urban rivers (e.g. the Pasig River in Manila, the
Brantas River in East Java and the Lyari and Malir Rivers in
Karachi} are heavily polluted by untreated sewage and in
dustrial wastes. Nevertheless, the cleanups of the Han River .

in the Republic of Korea and Singapore River during the
1980s indicate that actions to address water pollution can
be successful.

Simply addressing the management of physical
resources will not lead to a desirable pattern of development
unless adequate attention is paid to price adjustments to
encourage environment-friendly behavior and the
strengthening of human, capital and information resources.
Each city needs io develop its own, localized strategy that
responds to existing environmental conditions,
socioeconomic systerns and government structures. There
are, however, some key elements that are likely to be
common to most strategies: (i) conservation of nonrenewable resources and resource rehabilitation; (ii) management,
control and treatment of waste; (iii) a greater reliance on
market-based instruments (e.g. polluters pay) to supplement
regulatory approaches; and (iv) financial sustainability.
During the 1980s, Singapore successfully adopted policies
which integrated economic and environmental management. Massive investments are required to address urban
environmental problems. The Bank has begun to assist in
addressing these problems by financing integrated urban
environment projects (see Box 4}.

Making funding for urban development projects conditional on a satisfactory environmental impact assessment will
gradually help to improve the quality of such assessmenis.
The approach to managing urban environments must,
however, recognize the interdependence between environmental conditions, relative prices and broader economic and
environmental planning and policymaking. The
effectiveness of environmental safeguards built into
individual urban projects is often determined by “policies
related to cost recovery for pollution, environmental
standards, regulations and enforcement. While the design of
individual urban projects or programs should be improved
by subjecting them to environmental assessments, this must
be accompanied by better planning and policymaking
capabilities.

Managing Sustainable Urban Development

Sustainabie urban management, particularly in rapidly
growing cities, requires strong institutions and appropriate
financial systems and cost recovery policies. In most
countries. central governments play a dominant roie in
pianning and financing urban infrastructure. Institutional
arrangements for the planning, programming and coordination rban development and management must be
improved. Urban development enc management recuire

CHALLE ES OF URBANIZATION IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REI

local governments and horizontal coordination among
departments and authorities concerned at different levels of
government. Although many central governments empower
local governments to develop and provide urban infrastructure and services, most of the expertise and financial
resources rest with the central government. There is a need
to enhance the'role of municipalities in urban development
and decentralize authority and accountability. Some
countries (e.g. Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal and
Philippines) have made progress in this respect.
Decentralization must, however, be accompanied by
institutional “and human resource development at the
municipal level. In some DMCs, urban regulatory
frameworks are poorly formulated and their application is
usually time consuming and noi transparent. Often, weak
regulatory frameworks are accompanied by inappropriate
pricing policies which do not encourage desired behavior.
Weaknesses exist in most municipal institutions, both financial and technical, and programs designed to strengthen
local governments will be required during the rest of the
1990s. An adequate number of well trained urban
administrators, engineers and planners is essential if
authority is to be successfully devolved to local governments.

In most developing countries. local resource mobilization is insufficient and many municipal govemmments are
excessively dependent on central governments for grants
and subsidies. The financial weakness of local governments
affects their fiscal performance and constrains their ability
to provide municipal infrastructure and services. In most
DMCs, the potential for financial resource mobilization at .
the local level is not adequately exploited. The potential
exists for introducing more direct user charges to recover
costs, adjusting the level and structure of local taxes and
improving the efficiency of local tax collection (see Box 5).
In addition to their role in mobilizing resources, cost recovery
policies should be viewed as a means of enhancing urban
development and using scarce resources more efficiently.
Other problems related to municipal finance include inadequate revenue administration, an absence of proper maps
and information systems and ill-defined central-local fiscal
relations (e.g. central-local grant policies; the method of
channelling central funds for local purposes; and grant-loaneguity formula for project financing).

Efficient urban-based economic growth depends;
among other things, on the reform of public sector
enterprises and a greater participation of ihe private sector.
Public sector parinership with the private sector, including
NGOs and informal enterprises, is growing and needs to be
further encouraged. During the 1980s, most DMCs
adopted policies to encourage privatization in view of
increasing demands for services and infrastructure, although
the extent and speed with which DMCs have implemented
privatization schemes vary. Involving the private sector has
many advaniages. It provides financial resources. generates
efficiency, is able 20 respond to marke! forces and can take

Box 4; Improving Urban Environment in PRC

AX quality is poor in virtually all of PRC’s large cities, primarily because of the widespread and inefficient combustion
of low-quality coal. About 70 per cent of the wintertime atmospheric loading reflects coal burning for power
generation, industrial production and household needs. Air pollution in urban areas often surpasses the State norms
by several orders of magnitude. Pulmonary diseases linked to air pollution are the leading cause of death in the country.
Air pollution also contributes to the global problems of acid rain, greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting emissions.
_ Coastal waters and rivers near urban centers are polluted in PRC. In most cities industrial waste water is the predominant
source of water pollution. Of the 25 billion tons of industrial waste water discharged annually in PRC, only about
one-third is treated. The capacity for municipal waste water treatment is only a fraction of the total municipal waste
t water discharge. Runoff from untreated solid and hazardous wastes contaminates aquifers, the main source of drinking
. Water for urban areas.
!, "The Bank’s PRC strategy accords high priority to addressing urban environmental problems. Qingdao was selected
’ as the ‘site of the Bank’s first comprehensive urban environmental improvement project. Rapid growth and

Use of about 1.3 million tons of coal per annum, 4n thousands of inefficient domestic stoves and small boilers, which are a major source of air pollution, will be eliminated. '
Instead, gas will be supplied as the energy source, and steam and hot water will be provided for heating. These measures
, will reduce the average annual sulfur dioxide concentration by about 40 per cent, smoke and total suspended particulate 4
“concentration by 25 per cent and carbon dioxide emission by about 5 per cent. Waste water and sewage treatment
’ facilities will be established to treat about 14 per cent of all industrial waste water and 8 per cent of all dorhestic sewage.
Sustainable environmental improvement in Qingdao requires policy changes as well as capital investment and
institutional strengthening. ‘The use of market forces to address environmental problems was incorporated into the
project design. The project will promote coal price liberalization and elimination of subsidies to encourage efficient
energy use. Policy dialogue undertaken during project processing promoted sound financial and cost recovery policies
to sustain urban services required to reduce pollution. Since companies will recover costs through tariffs, existing
subsidies will be eliminated. Because consumers will bear full costs, the use of gas, industrial'steam, district heating

investment and operational decisions with speed and
flexibility. Because of these factors, the Bank supports the
adoption of policies which will encourage greater private
sector participation in urban development.

Public services can be contracted out to the private
sector (e.g. road maintenance and garbage collection).
Experience has shown that the private sector generally
operates bus services more efficiently than the public sector.
In Calcutta and Bangkok, for example, private mini-buses

provide convenient and flexible services in and around poor
neighborhoods. Privately-owned buses and jeepneys provide
urban transport in the Philippines and the Government is
examining ways of privatizing the light rail transit system in
Manila, There is scope for privatization of other municipal
services. In Nepal, many town governments use private
contractors to collect taxes, and in Sri Lanka municipal
markets are rented to private merchants under tender. The

in the 1960s and 1970s. it was accepted in most DMCs
that it was the responsibility of the government to provide
Virtually all urban infrastructure. Because of limited government resources and human resource constraints, this pattern
of investment was not susiainable. During the 1980s, several
countries in the region (e.g. Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines
and Thailand) adopted policies to encourage the private
sector to invest in urban. infrastructure, such es roads, using
the build-operaie-transfer method. Large water treatment
plants and solid waste management aiso offer significant
scope for private sector involvernent. The Government of
Malaysia hes taken steps to privatize the Selangor Water
Supply Company and has fourd thai the private sector

 

operates solid waste management sysiems more efficiently
than goverment agencies. The Government of Indonesia
is actively seeking to involve the private sector in water
supply and solid waste management. In India, federal and
state government agencies are encouraging private companies to become more heavily involved in land development
and low-cost housing construction. Many shelter programs
of DMCs, whether for slum improvement or
sites-and-services, involve the government, the private
sector ana NGOs as partners.

The opportunities for privatization of government
services and private sector investment in infrastructure are
greater in urban areas than in rural areas. In determining a
policy framework to encourage the private sector, many
factors must de considered. One maior issue is the degree
of freedorn the private sector will ve given to set and adjust
user charges. This is sometimes particulariy difficult when
there is a private sector monopoly providing a basic public

Box 6: Urban Development In Indonesia

uring the last two decades, the urban population of Indonesia grew by 5.2 per cent per annum, reaching about

56 million iri 1990, nearly a third of the national population. On average, 1.8 million new urban residents came

into urban areas every year. This rapid increase has posed major challenges to the Government. In response, the

Government has embarked on several innovative programs and invested heavily in urban development. The Bank has

assisted this effort with loans totalling over $1 billion for 12 urban development projects and four urban water supply

_ projects. In addition to several large cities (e.g., Bandung, Medan and Semarang}, this assistance has also benefited
nearly 200 towns and secondary cities in' West and Central Java and in Sumatra.

Urban development projects financed by the Bank typically benefit a large number of people, most of whom are .

urban poor. For example, approximately 5.7 million people living in 90 cities and towns in Central Java will benefit
from improvements financed under the $150 million loan for the Central Java and D. I. Yogyakarta Urban Development
Sector Project. Approved in 1992, this Project is designed to: (i) improve the urban environment and living conditions,
particularly in low-income areas; (ii) reduce impediments to economic growth; and (iii) enhance the capabilities of the
local governments in respect of local resource mobilization and financial management, human resource development,
‘environmental management, technical matters, operation and maintenance and urban management. Water supply,
‘waste water treatment, sanitation, solid waste management, urban roads, flood control and drainage and market
infrastructure will be improved under the Project. The criteria used to select sub- -projecis included: poverty reduction,
community participation, involvement of NGOs and environmental protection and improvement.

such as service coverage and possible impact on the poor,
are appropriately considered.

IMPLICATIONS FOR
BANK OPERATIONS

Bank operations in the urban sector have evolved from
lending for basic services, such as water supply and
low-income housing, in the 1970s, to an increasingly
integrated set of infrastructure and service projects, including
sanitation, solid waste management, urban transport, land
development for low-income groups and slum improvement.
Technical assistance has been provided to undertake sector
studies and to support regional urban development activities
intended to provide the analytical basis for refining Bank
operations, The objectives that the Bank seeks to achieve
through its urban development operations are to: (i) improve
the efficiency in urban econornies; (ii) promote equity and
services for the urban poor; {iii} enhance the urban environment; and (iv) strengthen institutional and financing
capabilities for the sustainable management of urban areas.
The Bank's related agenda for policy reform has focused on
improving the productivity of cities, reducing poverty, in
creasing the role of the private sector, decentralizing
authority and responsibility for urban affairs and strengthening municipal and housing finance systems. It has sought to
strengthen the capabilities of local governments and
municipal enterprises and to improve local resource
mobilization and financial management through cost
recovery and adjusimenis in the level and structure of local
taxes. Recently, the Bank began assessing economic policies
essential to the attainment of urban development objectives.

Bank loan and technical assistance projects have had
an impact on the region’s urban economies and growth,
including projects in sectors not directly associated with
urban development (e.g. energy, industry, transport and
communications}. By the end of 1992, the Bank had
provided loans totalling about $3 billion, of which over
40 per cent had been approved during the last five years,
and_148 technical assistance grants totalling about $48 million to finance various urban development projects.

Bank assistance for urban development can be broadly
grouped into two categories: (}} stand-alone projects for
urban water supply, sewerage, shelter for low-income
groups, urban transportation and urban flood protection;
and (ii) integrated projects which include a number of these
components. Of the 69 Bank-assisied urban development
projects, 25 were for improving urban water supply, nine£

for sewerage, one was for urban environment improvement,
four for uroan transport and 30 were integrated urban
development projects (see Box 6).

The Bank's efforts have involved some of the larger
cities in the region (e.g. Bandung, Bangkok, Dhaka,
Incheon, Karachi, Manila, Pusan and Shanghai). In addition,
considerable urban development assistance has been
provided to several hundred secondary towns, including
about 20 in Bangladesh, 200 in Indonesia and 40 in
Republic of Korea. An increasing emphasis has been placed
on developing the technical, financial and managerial
capacities of local governments.

In the 1990s, the Bank’s urban development operations have been intensified. Usually, the basic services
required by the urban poor (e.g. water supply, sanitation,
transport) are also required to create urban environments
that enhance economic efficiency and reduce urban poverty
through job creation. Resources devoted to policy reviews
and reforms and to the strengthening of local institutional
capabilities now account for an increasing proportion of the
Bank's assistance for urban development. Besides financing
project preparatory siudies, the Bank's technical assistance
has been used increasingly for sector policy reviews and
insiitutional development.

Future Directions

Many policy changes and massive investments will be
required to facilitate the ongoing transition in the region
from rural to urban societies. In line with these
developments, the Bank will intensify and expand its operations in urban areas. Its greater emphasis on strategic
planning at the country level provides the management tools
which will be used to guide and monitor the increasing
allocation of Bank resources for urban development.

Because of the importance of urban economies, greater
attention needs to be paid to macroeconomic and urban
economic interrelationships. As a regional resource center,
the Bank can be expected to target a larger proportion of
its research capability on this area. Cities require not only
favorable policy environments but also appropriate social
and economic infrastructure and services to support growth,
productivity and efficiency. Economic growth will be essential to provide the jobs that will be required in cities in the
coming decades. In today's globalized economy, cities of the
worlé compete with one another for investment capital,
technology and manageria! skilis. Because both sociai
(e.g. health and education) and economic (e.g. transport,
telecommunications and energy) infrastructure have an
impact on the growth and productivity of cities,
infrastructure needs to be planned in an integrated manner.

CHALLENGES OF URBANIZATION IN

 

One of the Bank's strengths lies in’ the financing of
infrastructure. It can build on this strength to become a
catalyst in this area. Research on urban poverty is being
undertaken and recently a framework to improve the financial and economic analysis of urban development projects
was completed. The results are expected to be used both
within the Bank and by executing agencies involved in urban
development. Greater emphasis will have to be placed on
the coordinated development of a broad set of infrastructure
facilities to improve economic efficiency.

The Bank’s strategy to reduce urban poverty will
emphasize urban economic growth and job creation, plus
some targeting of essential urban services at the poor. While
the issue of cost recovery must be addressed, equity
considerations may negate full cost recovery from the urban
poor. Attention will be increasingly tumed towards enhancing the role of community-based groups in the delivery of
urban services targeted at the urban poor.

A major challenge will be to ensure that urbanization is
environmentally sustainable. The expansion of metropolitan
areas in the region, including the emergence of megacities,
can lead to unprecedented !evels of pollution and environmental degradation unless appropriate measures are taken.
The Bank is committed to playing a leading role to improve
urban environmental management. It has provided technical
assistance granis for studies on matters such as managing
water resources to meet megacity needs, environmental
management of urban projects and vehicular emission, and
will continue to use such assistance selectively to promote
its role as a regional resource center. The use of appropriate
pricing policies to encourage environment-friendly behavior
will be an integral part of the Bank's urban environment
operations.

Efforts to strengthen municipal planning and management are also expected to be expanded. This will require
actions at both national and city levels to: (i) undertake policy
reform to involve the private sector in the provision of urban
infrastructure and services; (ii) strengthen urban institutions
through human resource development and training;
(iii) redefine and coordinate the roles of the national and local
govemments, and decentralize responsibility and accountability; {iv} promote appropriate pricing structures, cost

recovery and resource mobilization at the municipal level;
and {v) develop appropriate management information and
environment monitoring systems. To improve the effectiveness and sustainaoility of such aciions, community-based
organizations and beneficiaries must be encouraged to actively participate in project design and implementation,
especially in slum improvement areas. Through such
actions, the Bank will assist the DMCs in meeting the
challenges of urbanization in the twenty-first century.

economic reforms and structural changes undertaken in
recent years had begun to take effect in some of the DMCs.
Lao PDR and Viet Nam, two former centrally planned
economies, showed significant improvements in their
economic performance. In India, the positive effect of policy
reforms initiated in 1991 provided a favorable environment
for the country's moderate recovery in 1992.

Economic growth in many DMCs, including the newly
indusirializing economies (NIEs) -~ except in Hong Kong —
and major Southeast Asian countries, was adversely affected
by the prolonged recession in the world economy and
weakened domestic demand. Sore of these economies also
suffered from shortages of labor and infrastructure
bottlenecks.

Inflationary pressures somewhat eased in the DMCs as
a whole, reducing the inflation rate to 7.4 per cent from
8.8 per cent in 1991. While the softening of domestic
demand was the main reason behind the slower growth in
the average price index in the NiEs, tight monetary policies
were the biggest factor in the Southeast Asian countries. By
contrast, inflation started to build up in PRC as economic
expansion gathered momentum,

The current account balance of the DMCs as a whole
deteriorated, reflecting a higher trade deficit in many of the
countries. While a softening in world demand was partly to
blame, the deficit arose mainly from a faster growth in
imports. In general, foreign direct investment remained
high, although the rate of its growth slightly slackened in
many countries after the rapid increase in previous years.
The slowdown was due partly to problerns of absorption and
partly to the recession in the industrial world. For most
DMCs, however, the external debt situation continued to be
comforiable.

Newly Industrializing Economies*
Slower Growth

The prolonged recession in the world economy
adversely affected economic growth in the NIEs. The group's
average annual growth rate fell from 7.3 per cent in 1991
to 5.3 per cent in 1992, the lowest level recorded since
1985. Domestic demand, which led the countries’ rapid
econornic growth in recent years, weakened in the Republic
of Korea, while exports lost momentum in Singapore and
Taipei,China. The deceleration of economic growth was
particularly noticeable in Republic of Korea and Singapore.
In the case of the Republic of Korea, growth was affected
partly by the Government's efforts to cool down construction
activities and consumption, In Singapore, the construction
and transport sectors remained robust, but the
manufacturing sector stagnated, reflecting the relocation of

Hong Kong. Republic of Korea. Singapore and Taipei,China2s a7 a Se ee labor-intensive activities to the neighboring low-cost
Newly'Industrializing Economies.” 90S '-"> couniries and the closure of some cil refineries and chemical

commercial sectors remained weak. Taipei,China suffered
a slowdown in exporis, although investments grew as a result
of the implementation of the six-year national development
plan. Hong Kong was the only NIE which experienced an
acceleration in growth, largely due to its improved export
performance.

The slowdown substantially dissipated inflationary
pressures. The average inflation rate for the group,
measured by the consumer price index, fell to 5.9 per cent
from 7.6 per cent in 1991. Inflation was particularly low in
Singapore, due partly to .a significant appreciation of the
domestic currency since last year. Taipei,China experienced
a temporary acceleration in inflation because of a sharp rise
in vegetable prices, but still mainiained a relatively low rate
during the year. Inflation also eased substantially in Hong
Kong, where the labor market lost some of its tightness and
the effects of the indirect tax increase of 1991 petered off,
and in the Republic of Korea, where aggregate demand
slowed down, imports of agricultural products increased and
prices of real estate and construction materials fell.

External Sector

Exports from Hong Kong rose sharply, benefiting from
a booming Chinese economy. On the other hand, the
growth rate of exports from Republic of Korea, Taipei,China
and Singapore decelerated substantially. While shipments to
developing countries remained generally active, sales to
industrial countries stagnated. The import growth was
particularly strong in Hong Kong, partly as a result of the |
rapid rise in re-exports, and in Taipei,China due to robust
domestic demand. Republic of Korea and Singapore, on the
other hand, experienced a significant deceleration in the
growth rate of imports. The combined trade balance of the
NIEs deteriorated slightly, owing particularly. to a sharp
reduction in Taipei,China’s trade surplus.

Monetary policies of the NIEs in 1992 were generally
non-expansionary. Taipei,China announced a package of
financial measures to tighten credit and dampen fears of
rising prices. For the first time; foreign futures trading was
allowed and 15 newly approved private banks were

5 aelarge fluctuations in Interbank rates.

The NIEs' approaches to fiscal policy were varied. in
the Republic of Korea, the policy was less expansionary.
However, while the Government's attempt to reduce
inflationary pressures constrained budget management,
some policy emphasis was given on industrial restructuring
and technology development. In addition to increased
expenditures and incentives on R&D, accelerated
depreciation was announced of up to 90 per cent of
high-tech investmenis in the first year starting in 1993. In
Taipei,China, public investments rose substantially as the
budget deficit was allowed to widen to support the six-year
national development plan, which emphasizes infrastructure
construction. The progress of the plan, however, was slower
than expected because of difficulty in land acquisition,
environmental concerns and labor shortage.

Both Republic of Korea and Taipei,China continued to
liberalize their external sector. Their import liberalization
ratlos rose and the average tariff rates were further reduced,
In addition, the Korean Government changed its system of
foreign exchange management during the year. This change
would substantially reduce restrictions on external transactions, keeping such restrictions only in exceptional cases.
The Korean Government also established new guidelines to
encourage overseas investment by the private sector. In
Taipei,China, tariffs were lowered on nearly 2,000 import
items, including automobiles and environmental protection
equipment. Taipei,China became a GATT observer and
obtained the right to attend GATT activities.

The countries’ exchange rate policies differed
significantly, partly reflecting the trade balance under each
economy. The Korean won continued to depreciate against
the US dollar, as the country experienced trade deficits. The
Singapore dollar, on the other hand, appreciated
substantially, The Hong Kong dollar remained broadly
stable. During the first half of the year, the New Taiwan
dollar continued to appreciate against the US dollar.
However, it depreciated during the second half as the
balance of payments deteriorated.

Southeast Asia*
Sustained Growth

Economic growth in Southeast Asia as a whole
continued to decline and was estimated at 5.8 per cent in
1992. Further slowdowns in Indonesia, Malaysia and
Thailand were primarily to blame. The Philippines registered
a zero growth rate, an improvement over the negative
growth in 1991 caused by natural disasters and severe power

shortages. Lao PDR and Viet Nam both reversed the growth
declines registered in the previous year.

Tight monetary policy squeezed domestic demand in
Indonesia, and GDP growth of 5.9 per cent in 1992 was
down from 6.6 per cent in 1991. As the
balance-of-payments position improved and inflation eased,
the central bank gradually relaxed monetary policy, which
strengthened domestic demand in the latter half of the year.
Agriculture recovered after a bad year of drought in 1991,
and boosted the non-oil sector. However, both industry and
services continued to slow down.

In Malaysia, after the rapid GDP growth of previous
years, which had led to labor shortages, higher wages,
inflationary pressures and a widening of the current account
deficit, domestic monelary policy was tightened. As a result,
manufacturing, construction and services slowed down,
while agriculture recovered from stagnation in the past two
years and mining improved due to a significant growth in
gas production,

Political uncertainty, infrastructure bottlenecks and a
generally overheated economy were some of the factors that
dampened both domestic demand and investment in
Thailand. Nonetheless, GDP grew at 7.5 per cent in 1992,
slightly slower than the previous year’s rate. The impact of
the military crackdown in May was limited and a rapid
recovery in investment took place shortly after the situation
had stabilized. The country’s economic fundamentals, in
terms of a diversified export market and production

‘structure, remained strong, confidence in the economy

Picked up sharply following general elections in September
and the subsequent peaceful transition of power,

The Philippine economy was hit by a series of natural
disasters and a severe power shortage. The economy, which
had declined by almost 1 per cent in 1991, staged a very
weak recovery during 1992, helped by reconstruction and
rehabilitation efforts in calamity areas and recent economic
reforms. An austerity program brought inflation under
conirol and interest rates had begun to fall. The peaceful
transfer of power helped boost investor confidence and a
new medium-term economic plan was put in place
envisaging further trade and investment liberalization and
greater involvement of the private sector, However, the
economy continued to face major problems. The agriculture
sector remained vulnerable to natural calamities. A weak
infrastructure, epitomized by massive power shortages,
continued to dampen investment.

In Lao PDR and Viet Nam, economic reforms showed
some positive results in 1992. Following its 1991 decline
resulting from a drastic reduction in agricultural output due
to both drought and floods, Lao PDR’s GDP grew by
7.3 per cent in 1992. Viet Nam achieved a growth rate of
8.3 per cent, against 6 per cent in 1991, with a marked
increase in agricultural production, especially food. The
buoyancy of Viet Nam’s centrally-managed enterprises
bodsied the industry sector. Private sector participation alsoOPMENTS iN DMCs

Inflation eased during the year in Southeast Asia due
mainly to tight monetary policies and more stringent fiscal
programs. However, infrastructure bottlenecks and rising
wages continued to exert an upward -pressure in some
countries. In the Philippines, the annual inflation rate
decelerated sharply from 18.7 per cent in 1991 to
8.9 per cent in 1992 in the wake of stringent monetary and
fiscal programs. These measures were able to offset the
effects of power and water rate adjustments, supply
bottlenecks resulting from drought and the aftermath of
Mt. Pinatubo's eruption. In Indonesia, liquidity and credit
squeeze since the end of 1991 restrained domestic demand
and helped reduce the inflation rate..In Thailand, there were
fears that the introduction of the value-added tax, reductions
in personal income tax and substantial wage increases in
April would put pressure on prices. However, the continuing
slowdown of the economy held inflation to 4.1 per cent, In
Malaysia, high growth and wage increases pushed inflation
to 4.7 per cent in 1992. Strict controls on monetary expansion and a prudent financial policy helped ease inflation in
Viet Nam from close to 70 per cent in 1991 to around
38 per cent in 1992. The Government intervened to ensure
adequate supplies of food and production inputs, which
helped to stabilize market prices. For the first time, inflation
in Lao PDR fell to a single digit, mainly due to the
Government's stabilization efforts and tight monetary policy.

External Sector

In some Southeast Asian countries, exports remained
robust in 1992. This was particularly true of Malaysia, where

economic growth has resulted from the positive contribution
of the external sector. In contrast, imports showed a growth
of only 6 per cent in 1992, compared with over 25 per cent
in 1991. A large part of this decline was due to decreased
capital goods imports as investrnent growth decelerated. As
a consequence, Malaysia's current account deficit eased to
less than 5 per cent of GDP in 1992 compared with almost
10 per cent in the previous year.

- Thailand continued to perform well in its exports, which
grew by an estimated 17.8 per cent during 1992. However,
since imports increased by close to 13 per cent, the current
accouni deficit as a proportion of GDP, though improved,
was still 6.4 per cent. Thailan¢’s competitiveness in international trade remained strong despite shortages of skilled
sabor and higher wages.

an almost 15 per cent growth in imports against a
10 per cent growth in exports, Almost half the growth in
imports could be fraced to higher purchases of raw materials
and intermediate goods. Manufactured imports grew at a
much slower pace. On the other hand, manufactured
exports, especially electronics and garments, expanded significantly. However, the appreciation of the peso and the
sluggish economies of the industrialized countries retarded
the overall growth in exports.

Indonesia recorded a 13.5 per cent growth in exports.
However, irnports grew at a rate much higher than expected
as a result of the megaproject sanctioned by the Government
in 1992, pushing the current account deficit to almost
$4 billion.

Exports picked up in Viet Nam by over 26 per cent,
against an 18.1 per cent decline in 1991, while imports
grew by only 9 per cent, compared with negative
20 per cent in the previous year. These changes were due
partly to the stabilization of the dong and partly to a
substantial increase in crude oil and mineral exports. With
the demise of barter trade with the former Soviet Union and
Eastern European countries, Viet Nam has undertaken a
major restructuting of imports, Lao PDR suffered a wide ning
of its current account deficit to 3.6 per cent of GDP as its
exports lagged behind its imports.

Policy Reforms

Behind Southeast Asia’s emergence as one of the
world’s fastest-growing subregions lies its commitment to
sustained and consistent policy reforms. This has been the
biggest factor in generating investor confidence in the
region, both foreign and domestic, and has helped the
region absorb and overcome unfavorable circumstances in
the world economy. To counter a decline in foreign direct
investments over the ‘last couple of years, Malaysia has
increased its effort to encourage private domestic
investment. The Government has been able to Pursue its
privatization policy in the context of a rapidly growing
economy. The continued development of the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange has made the stock market an important
source of capital for the country’s private secior,

Deregulation of the Indonesian economy, particularly
in the financial sector, continued. Efforts to develop the
money and capital markets reflected a desire to make
monetary management more market-based. Trade and
investment incentives were liberalized between April and
duly 1992, which made a breakthrough possible on the
Chandra Asri petrochemical megaproject. In addition,
restrictions on several commodity exports were removed
and various tariff barriers relaxed. Presidential decrees and
parliamentary legislation were also approved to allow private
sector participation in infrastructure, particularly in the
power and transport sectors. A tight monetary policy was
maintained, with some relaxation during the latter half of the

 
    

year when both the inflation rate and the external balance
improved,

In the Philippines, the newly installed administration
pursued the basic pattern of reforms initiated under the
Previous regime. These reforms, designed to open the
economy to increased participation in international markets
as well as increased competition on the domestic front,
included a considerable relaxation of foreign exchange
controls and legislation to encourage foreign direct
investment. The stabilization Program was successfully
maintained, which helped reduce inflation and interest rates.
The Government is particularly targeting infrastructure and
public construction, badly needed for future development,
and is seeking to remedy recurring power, transportation
and communication problems.

In Thailand, policy initiatives were unaffected by
domestic political disturbances. In its effort to liberalize the
financial system, the central bank removed interest rate
ceilings and adjusted foreign exchange regulations to make
international trade and invesiment more flexible. The Board
of Investment restructured Policies to improve the
investment climate, Tariffs were further reduced and a
number of trade restrictions were removed, In August, the
Finance Ministry announced the establishment of the
Bangkok International Banking Facility, which is expected
to promote Bangkok as a major financial center for
Southeast Asia.

Continuing its market-oriented reforms, Viet Nam
made further efforts to improve the financial and monetary
Situation, control inflation and stabilize the exchange rate.
its other major macroeconomic policy concern was to give
more management freedom io state-owned enterprises,
cooperatives and farms. Privatization of state enterprises
continued on an experimental basis. Moreover, new tax and
fiscal reforms were undertaken.

In Lao PDR, the reform of state enterprises was
continued, particularly in respect of enterprises under the
Ministries of Agriculture and Forests, Commerce and
Tourism, and Communications, Transport, Ports and
Construction. Monetary and fiscal Policies remained sound,
helping to increase revenues and control expenditure. The
tax base was further broadened and tax administration was
improved. Due emphasis was Given to trade liberalization
and human resource development,

South Asia*
Improved Performance

Most countries of South Asia experienced stronger
growth in 1992. Aggregate GDP for the subregion grew by

* Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhuian, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka.ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN DMCs

 

4.4 per cent in 1992, compared with a 2.1 per cent growth
in the previous year. The growth rate increased in
Bangiadesh despite the fact that the agriculture sector was
affected by floods in the northern areas in September 1991
and an unusually dry weather in March and April 1992. Sri
Lanka had slightly lower growth. While non-plantation
agritulture recorded a slight increase, the severe drought in
the first half of 1992 affected tea crop production. The
growth of industry and services, though high, was lower than
in 1991, reflecting a slowdown in export processing, mining
and construction. In contrast, India’s economic growth
accelerated to an estimated 4.2 per cent in 1992 from
4.3 per cent in 1991. Agriculture, which had been stagnant
in the previous year, recovered as the production of
foodgrains and commercial crops rose significantly. So did
industrial production, reflecting the favorable impact of trade
liberalization measures. Poor monsoon cut Nepal’s growth
rate to 3.1 per cent from 5.5 per cent in 1991. Foodgrain
production declined by 7 per cent, resulting in an overall
growth in agriculture of only 0.5 per cent. Pakistan
maintained last year’s upward trend in economic growth,
reflecting an improved performance in agriculture and
manufacturing. Agriculture benefited from a bumper cotton

crop, increased support prices for major crops and greater °

private sector freedorn in procurement. Manufacturing
received its boost mainly from a rapid growth in cotton-based
manutactures and increased sugar and fertilizer production.
Investment in the industrial sector rose sharply as a result of
deregulation and liberalization, which boosted the
confidence of private investors. In Myanmar, GDP growih
in 1992 was slightly lower than the 1.3 per cent rate
achieved in 1991. In Maldives, economic growth was estimated at 8 per cent in 1992 with both fishing and tourism
sectors remaining robust.

While inflation continued to be a major problem,
significant improvements were seen in many countries in
South Asia. In Pakistan, inflation decelerated to an
estimated 10.1 per cent, from 11.8 per cent in 1991,
reflecting a sharp decline in the rate of price increase for
fuel, transport and communications. Despite a slight
acceleration in the growth of money supply and a higher
budget deficit as a percentage of GDP, tight dernand
management and stable foodgrain prices helped to reduce
inflation in Bangladesh to 5 per cent from 7.2 per cent in
1991. In Sri Lanka, the inflation raie decreased slightly from
12.2 per cent in 1991 to 11 per cent in 1992. Improved
fiscal performance, achieved mainly through a reduction in
capital expenditures, led to a sharp drop in the growth of
money supply (M2) from 19 per cent in 1991 io about
13 per cent and helped dampen the pressure on the agGregaie price level brought about by ihe recent severe
drought. .

Ir. India, economic adjustment and reform efforts had
an important effect in curbing inflation. The inflation rete

year to 8 per cent in December. In Nepali, inflation
accelerated to 17 per cent from 15.5 per cent in 1991,
reflecting strong demand pressures, the effects of a poor
monsoon, the impact of the July 1992 devaluation and
substantial adjustments in public enterprise prices.

External Sector

In 1992, the external payments position of Bangladesh
significantly improved. The current account surplus
increased to 0.9 per cent of GDP as against 0.2 per cent of
GDP in 19914 due to strong export performance and a
contraction in imports. Inflows of workers’ remittances also
increased to support to the balance-of-payments position.
Exports increased by 14.3 per cent, mainly due to an upward trend in garment shipments. Imports increased by
5 per cent.

Sri Lanka’s external accounts improved mainly on the
strength of a rapid growth in exports anda significantly lower
level of imports. Industrial exports, led by garments, showed
a rapid increase. The surge would have been more dramatic
had tea exports not declined substantially. The sharp drop
in imports was attributable mainly to a build-up of investment
goods, :

Nepal saw its exports grow by 28 per cent, reflecting
its more liberal exchange rate regime and such export
promotion measures as the abolition of export taxes and
improvement of duty drawback schemes. Imports showed
only an 8.6 per cent growth because of the duly 1991
devaluation and the expected tariff reduction in the
1992/1993 budget. The current account, therefore,
improved in 1992.

For Pakistan, the current account deficit widened,
reflecting a sharp rise in imports of capital goods and
equipment following trade and foreign exchange liberalization, and a sharp decline in remittances. Exports registered
a significant increase in terms of value despite a slump in
Pakistan's major markets and sluggish prices.

In India, while exports grew, imports grew faster,
resulting in a substantial widening of the trade deficit. With
a slight increase in transfers and a deterioration in the net
services account, the current account balance deteriorated
slightly from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent of GDP.

Domestic Policies

The pace of policy reforms quickened during the year
in many South Asian countries. In India, further structural
changes were adopted and the number of goods in the
negative list of imports and exports was further reduced.
Licensing was abolished for most industries. Foreign investment regulations were relaxed to allow participation by
foreigners even in critical sectors, such as oil exploration and
development. To reduce the role of the Government in the
economy, the process of divestment continued. The Govern
 

 

ment is also encouraging privatization of some of the functions of public sector units. Since late 1992, the Government
has allowed reputable foreign institutional investors, including pension funds, investment trusts and asset management
companies to invest in the Indian capital market. This is, of
course, subject to certain limitations.

Nepal announced major reforms in its trade, industry
and foreign investment sectors to mobilize revenue, increase
efficiency and enhance the international competitiveness of
its economy. Foreign exchange regulations were liberalized
and exporters were allowed to exchange 65 per cent (later
increased to 75 per cent) of their foreign exchange earnings
into rupees at the free market rate. Import licenses on a
majority of goods were abolished. A major component of
the New Industrial Policy announced in June 1992 was the
abolition of industrial licensing for all new, expansion and
diversification projects, except in a few areas such as national defense and public health. The Government has also
considerably relaxed its regulations on foreign investment.
A number of reforms were undertaken to put banks on a
commercial footing.

As part of its effort to enhance domestic resource
mobilization, Pakistan broadened the base for direct taxes
by introducing minimum taxes on income and profits
applicable to all corporate taxpayers. In the area of indirect
taxation, the 1992 budget extended the coverage of the
general sales tax both vertically from the production to the
wholesale stage for some items and horizontally by eliminating exemptions on some domestically produced items. In the
financial sector, a new debt management system was introduced, under which the Government began funding part of
its deficit through a market-oriented auction system. The
comprehensive program of privatization of public
enterprises, initiated in February 1991, was continued and
all the manufacturing units of the 115 public enterprises
scheduled for privatization had been advertised for sale.
About 50 per cent of these had either been sold by auction
or negotiations on their sale were at an advanced stage.

All important elements of Sri Lanka's structural
adjustment and stabilization program progressed during the
year, including budget restructuring and public enterprise,
financial and trade reforms. Progress was achieved
particularly in liberalizing trade and rationalizing the tariff
structure. Foreign investment controls had been virtually
eliminated, except for a few items. Poverty reduction
programs were also implemented effectively.

Bangladesh continued to accelerate the process of
policy reforms. In July 1991, the Government removed
quantitative restrictions on 59 import categories,
progressing toward its target of achieving complete import
liberalization by the end of 1993. Import tariffs were further
liberalized. in the area of finance, ceilings on all deposit rates
and ceilings and floors on all lending rates were removed
except on those for agriculture, exports, and small and
cottage industries, which were retained for developmental- and social reasons. The value-added tax was successfully
introduced and the tax administration was improved.

The Government of Myanmar encouraged the private
sector in many fields, particularly foreign trade, previously
exclusively restricted to the state. Tax reforms were also
implemented by establishing commercial, income and profit
taxes. Tax rates were reduced and exemption and relief were
allowed to encourage foreign investment.

People’s Republic of China
and Mongolia

Double-Digit Growth in PRC

The economy of PRC grew by an estimated
12.8 ver cent in 1992, significantly higher than the average
growth of 5.3 per cent in the last three years. The
momentum generated by the Government's economic
reforms was the main driving force behind the current
economic boom. However, bottlenecks in transportation,
energy, communications and raw material production
provided cause for concern. Inflationary pressures were also
building up.

Despite a reduction in the sown area and serious
drought in many parts of the country, total grain output
increased 1.5 per cent. The indusirial sector remained
buoyant. Heavy industries, spurred by an increased demand
for investment goods, surged; non-state sectors (collective,
private and foreign joint ventures) continued to grow
impressively; and the efficiency of state enterprises
improved, as indicated by higher amounts of taxes and
profits handed to the state. The services sector improved,
too, particularly as a result of a dynamic real estate sector.

As economic growth reached the double-digit rate, an
increasing pressure was felt on inflation. Prices of production
material showed a double-digit increase as a result of growth
in the industrial sector and soaring investment in fixed assets.
While retail sale prices remained at 5.4 per cent during
1992, the cost-of-living index rose by 10.9 per cent in 35
large and rnedium-sized cities. Some price reform measures
also exerted inflationary pressure.

Despite the slow growth of world trade, PRC's external
sector remained bright. Exports grew by over 18 per cent,
the fastest growth among the DMCs. This was made possible
mainly by continuing foreign trade reforms (including the
abolition of export subsidies), the freedom for productive
enterprises to engage directly in foreign trade, additional
export incentives, such as a higher proportion of foreign
exchange earnings reiainabie by exporters and the
depreciation of the Chinese currency. Imports surged by
about 26 per cent in response to domestic demand,
relaxatior: of import controls as well as reform measures in
the import managing system.

Continuing Adjustment in Mongolia

Mongolia continued its series of reforms to move
toward a market economy. The severity of the recession
experienced in the past two years, as indicated by a
16.2 per cent decline in GDP in 1991, eased somewhat, In
1992, the decline in real GDP was estimated to be
7.6 per cent. The economic difficulties were most apparent
in the industrial sector, hit by shortages of petroleum, spare
parts of vehicles and mining equipment. Agriculture
suffered, too, from shortages of inputs and a shrinkage in
the sown area for major crops. However, in the final quarter
of 1992, the country made some progress in improving its
macroeconomic management. Bank credit was largely
under control. Government revenue increased and
government expenditure was keptunder tighter control. The
overall fiscal deficit for the year was lower than projected,
though still large. Imports fell while exports rose modestly.
Consequently, the current account deficit narrowed to about
$46 million from $111 million in 1991. However,
unemployment continued to rise and inflation rernained high
(820 per cent) and essential commodities were in short
supply.

Domestic Policies

Economic reforms in PRC gained further momentum
in 1992, particularly after the 14th Party Congress.
Enterprise reform became the key component of this new
effort, and the rights of enterprises to determine output
levels, prices and personnel policies were defined. Price
reforms were also pushed and the number of light industrial
items regulated by the State Price Bureaus was reduced from
737 io 89. The Government also removed the ceiling on
the non-plan price of gasoline and oil products, steel and
nonferrous metals, and reduced the share of plan allocation
of key raw materials. 
In the external sector, reforms sought to improve the
efficiency of foreign trade and make it compatible with the
GATT regime. Tariffs on about 4,000 items, mostly industrial supplies and semi-manufactures, were lowered. The
import licensing system and import regulatory taxes were
liberalized. Efforts were also made to increase the
transparency of the country’s trade policy and to change the
laws on patents and intellectual property rights to align them

with international standards. The Government also relaxed °

controls on foreign investment, opening up areas previously
closed to foreigners, such as retail sales, transport and
communications, finance and real estate.

Mongolia progressed further in dismantling central
planning, setting up market-oriented institutions and
jnitiating privatization. The privatization program, covering
state-owned agricultural assets, was almost complete by the
third quarter of 1992, with over 90 per cent of cooperatives
and over 75 per cent of state farms having been transferred

42

to private owners and joint stock companies. The
privatization of small businesses was completed in urban
areas and that of medium and large state-owned enterprises
had been undertaken. New corporate and personal tax laws,

. the sales tax law and the law on tax administration were
approved by Parliament to improve domestic resource

mobilization. The Government had stopped subsidizing
enterprises from the budget in order to keep public
expenditure under control. The ceniral bank’s lending rates
to commercial banks increased to 35-60 per cent from
5-15 per cent. The Government also unified the barter and
official exchange rates. Commercial banks and agents were
authorized to participate in the free exchange market.

Pacific Island DMCs”

Diverse Trends

There were substantial differences among the Pacific
island DMCs in terms of economic growth in 1992. in
Papua New Guinea, GDP grew by 9 per cent, only a
half per cent lower than in the previous year. The mineral
sector was mainly responsible for this growth, although
other areas of the economy also showed some improvement, Following a decline of 0.1 per cent in 1991. Fijl’s
economy recovered to a growth rate of 3 per cent in 1992.
The turnaround was largely the result of a recovery in
tourism and related services, along with continued growth
in manufacturing, especially garments for export. In.
Marshall Islands, economic growth was affected by the
slower-than-expected recovery in the US, its dominant trade
partner, as well as by cyclone damage in late 1991 and early
1992.

Economic growth in Solomon Islands improved to
5 per cent, with outputs and exports of copra, palm oil and
logs increasing. In Western Samoa, following widespread
destruction caused by cyclone Val, GDP fell by 5 per cent,
after dectining by 1.5 per cent in 1991. The growth rate in
Tonga was 2 per cent, compared with a 5.3 per cent growth
in 1991. The main reason was the decline in squash exports
following the imposition of a production quota system as a
means of improving the quality of products. In Vanuatu,
cyclone damage to tree crops was the principal factor behind
the zero growth rate in 1992 compared with 3.4 per cent
in 1991.

The inflation situation was equally varied, though a
downward trend was generally evident. In Western Samoa,
inflation had declined to 1.4 per cent in 1991 but rose to
about 10 per cent in 1992, most of which occurred in the

 

- Cook islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Masshal) Islands, Federated States of
Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon islands, Tonga, Vanuatu and
Wester Samoa.

first half of the year because of shortages in food suppiies
as a result of cyclone damage. Shortages in food supplies
because of drought were largely responsible for the sharp
rise in inflation in Tonga in the first half of 1992. However,
as supplies improved, the pressure abated to an annual rate
of about 5 per cent by the end of the year.

Papua New Guinea also experienced a decline in
inflation to less than 5 per cent from 7 per cent on average
in the two previous years. Tight demand control and the
much lower rise in import prices were the main reasons
behind the decline. The same factors also operated behind
the marked decline in Solomon Islands’ inflation from
15 per cent in 1991 to under 10 per cent in 1992. Inflation
tended to accelerate in Marshall Islands, where prices had
been generally stable in the past because of prudent financial
management, the openness of the economy and the use of
the US dollar as the local currency.

External Trade

After declining substantially in 1991, both exports and
imports recovered in Fiji. Exports rose by 9 per cent mainly
because of higher exports of garments, gold and sugar while
imports rose at a slightly higher rate. Though the trade deficit
worsened, the current account surplus increased from
$18.9 million to an estimated $46.6 million, or 4 per cent
of GDP, mainly because of a substantial improvement in
tourism receipts. Papua New Guinea experienced a nearly
30 per cent increase in exports mainly because of higher
shipments of oil, gold, copper and some agricultural
products. Consequently, the deficit on current account
declined to 4 per cent of GDP from 7 per cent in 1991..In
Western Samoa, exports of traditional agricultural products
were well below normal levels because of cyclone damage

" to tree crops, but shipments of automotive wiring units, the

production of which had started in late 1991, more than
compensated for the loss. These units now comprise mere
than 80 per cent of the country’s total exports. However,
imports of construction materials and of inputs for the
country’s automoiive electrical unit factory rose sharply,
pushing up both the trade and current account deficits.
Tonga’s merchandise exports decreased in 1992 and, although imports remained stable, the deficit on services
account rose sharply, widening the current account deficit
from 0.4 per cent of GDP in 1991 to 4.5 per cent in 1992.

Domestic Policies

Economic reforms in the PIDMCs during the year were
basically a continuation of policies adopted ir the previous
years, primarily to make the economies more open and
outward-oriented. Reform of the fiscal sector remained a
particular objective. In Papue New Guinea, significant tax
reforms were announced. including cuts in personal and
corporate taxes and a rationalization of indirect taxation. Fiji

had yet to firmly establish the economic stance of its new
Government, following general elections in May, but the
program of deregulation initiated by the previous government was expected to be followed. The introduction of a
10 per cent VAT in mid-1992 to broaden the tax base and
make collection more efficient was a step in that direction.
The Government also continued previous measures for a
progressive reduction of financial assistance to public
enterprises and has encouraged their restructuring in order
to corporatize them in the short-term and privatize them
eventually. In Tonga, fiscal policy was more restrained in
1992 than it had been over the previous two years as the
Government attempted to reduce the fiscal deficit. In
Vanuatu, the Government reemphasized its desire to
encourage investment through policies favoring low interest
rates and low inflation. Western Samoa recently completed
the preparation of iis Seventh Development Plan (19921994) and the associated Public Sector Investment Program.
While the country’s long-term development objectives
remained essentially the same as before, the restoration of
basic services and the rehabilitation of infrastructure
darnaged by cyclone were identified as the main focus of
development during the Seventh Plan period.

Recognizing the need to restrain growth in the public
sector, the Government of Kiribati was in the process of
reviewing public sector operations to identify activities which
could be privatized and where public sector effictency should
be improved, Tonga was seeking to reform its administrative
and budgetary procedures in order to reduce its fiscal deficit.
In Solomon Islands, the Government explored ways to bring
its fiscal affairs into better balance. The budget deficit
declined during the year as cash management and revenue
collection became more effective.

Outlook for 1993

The outlook for the world economy appears very
uncertain at the present time. While a firmer recovery is
projected for Australia and North America, most economies
in Europe are not expected to show any great strength.
Fiscal policies will remain predominantly restrictive in both
the US and EC, as budgetary consolidation continues.
Monetary policies are likely to be eased in Europe and some
convergence of interest rates will occur. The economy of
Japan is expected to recover somewhat as a result of fiscal
stimulus and some loosening of monetary policy.

The trade environment is not expected to improve
much in 1993 as world economic growth continues to be
sluggish. Commodity prices, including those for oil, could
increase somewhat in nominal terms, but would remain
stable in real terms. Compounding the uncertainties in world
trade are the dangers of a resurgence in protectionism
associated with unresolved negotiations on GATT (Uruguay
Round).

 

 

The world economy is projected to expand at a rate of
about 1.5 per cent in 1993 as the US and Japan recover.
Germany is not expected to show much improvernent. In
the industrial countries as a whole, growth is estimated at
1.9 per cent. Among the developing countries, ihe
economies of Latin America and Africa are expected to
show some acceleration in income. After contracting for
several successive years, production is projected to recover
in. a number of eastern European countries. In the countries
of the former Soviet Union, output will continue to fall albeit
at a slower pace than over the last two years.

 

Philippmes is one of the private sector beneficiaries under the
NGO Microcredit Project. supported by two Bank loans totalling
$38 million from ADF.In spite of some global recovery, the Asian and Pacific
region will have to rely largely on domestic demand and
intraregional trade to stimulate additional growth. GDP
growth of the DMCs on aggregate is projected at
7.2 per cent in 1993, slightly higher than in 1992.
However, economic growth in the NIEs will continue to be
constrained by labor shortages, high property costs and
environmental concerns, and it will be difficult in the near
future to achieve the rapid growth rates of the 1970s and
1980s, Only a moderate growth is projected for the NiEs,
the major stimulus coming frem domestic demand,
infrastructure investment and exports. The Korean economy
is expected to improve after the sharp slowdown in 1992,
while the growth rate of Taipei,China will also increase
somewhat reflecting the expansion of public and private
consumption. Hong Kong and Singapore will benefit from
the slight acceleration in world trade.

Southeast Asia is forecast to grow by about 6.5 per cent
in 1993, slightly higher than in 1992. A moderate rebound
is expected in the Philippines, where fundamental economic
reforms initiated in 1991 will create a policy environment
conducive to growth. However, power shortages will keep
the country’s growth rate well below potential. With
continued growth in non-oi! manufactured exports as well
as a strengthening of domestic demand, the growth rate wil
also improve in Indonesia. In Malaysia, concems about
inflation are likely to result in the continuation of a firm
monetary policy and a tightening of fiscal policy. GDP
growth is projected at 8 per cent. The Thai economy has
strong econornic fundamentals in terms of production siructure and a diversified export market, and thus is expected to
be able to maintain its growth momentum in the near future.
Overall economic growth in 1993 is projected at
7.8 per cent. The key factors behind such an anticipated
improvement will be an increase in private investment,
foreign capital inflows and tourism. As policy reforms are
well under way in Lao PDR and Viet Nam, these countries
are expected to achieve high growth rates in 1993. In the
case of Viet Nam, growth prospects would be much brighter
if the US trade embargo is lifted and multilateral financial
assistance is reestablished.

South Asia is expected io expand by 5.3 per cent in
1993 compared with 4.4 per cent in 1992. In Bangladesh,
economic growth is likely to accelerate slightly in 1993, and

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN DMCs

the macroeconomic situation should improve further due to
a reduction in the current account deficit and falling inflation.
In Pakistan, growth in 1993 is expected to remain high as
the private sector responds to an improved business environment and counteracts the contractionary effect of the
reduced budget deficit. Greater efficiency in the financial
sector through more market-oriented management is
expected to improve performance in the real sectors of the
economy. Growth in Sri Lanka is expected to accelerate as
the plantation sector is forecast to pick up, combined with
substantial investments under foreign-aided projects. In
Nepal, where a difficult fiscal and balance-of- payments situa
tion will constrain policymakers, GDP growth is expected to |

decline to 2.8 per cent. Economic prospects in India will
depend on the success of liberalization and stabilization
policies to contain the fiscal deficit and balance-of payments
constraints, and favorable weather conditions. Agriculture is
expected to maintain its growth, assuming that monsoon is
favorable. industry is expected to continue its upward trend.

The current economic boom in PRC is likely to continue
in 1993. The Governmeni will pursue efforts to accelerate
the implementation of economic reforms and the open-door
policy. Mongolia’s prospects will depend largely on the
successful implementation of market reforms. At present, a
further decline in economic growth is expected as structural
weaknesses remain largely unsolved and the external environment continues to deteriorate.

Among the PIDMCs, economic growth is forecast to
accelerate in Papua New Guinea on account of a full year’s
production from the Kutubu oil project and increased
production from the country’s major mines. In Fiji, GDP
growth is expected to be lower than the 3 per cent rate in

- 1992, reflecting extensive cyclone damage to agriculture

and infrastructure. Political developments are also relevant
insofar as they affect investor confidence. In Solomon
Islands, growth is likely to be sornewhat less than 5 per cent
achieved in 1992 because of difficulties in increasing exports
in the short term. Economic growth should improve in
Vanuatu to about 2.5 per cent as the country continues to
recover from the cyclone damage of 1992. However, in
Tonga, growth is expected to be lower than in 1992 as
vanilla exports contract in accordance with the production
cycle and as exports of squash are restricted by production
quotas.

 

 

|Straiegic Objectives

centerpiece of development and that economic growth

I: IS increasingly recognized that people should be the
should be efficient, equitable and sustainable. While

efficient economic growth has always been the Bank’s goal,

in recent years it has increasingly emphasized the quality and
sustainability of such growth (including equity aspects). The
Bank has also intensified its focus on issues of social
significance based on a participatory approach to
development, greater gender and social analysis, benefit
monitoring and evaluation, and cooperation with
non-governmental organizations {NGOs}.

In tune with its changing perceptions and perspectives,
the Bank initiated in 1992 a process of strategic planning
to more clearly define its priorities and tailor its operations
to directly address these concerns. In March 1992, the Bank
adopted a Medium-Ferm Strategic Framework (1992-1995)
defining five strategic objectives for its operations:
(i) promotion of economic growth, (ii) reduction of poverty,
iit) improvement of the status of women. {iv) development
of human resources (including, among other things,
population planning), and (v) sound management of natural
resources and the environment. In achieving these
objectives, which are overlapping and mutually reinforcing,
the Bank emphasizes the role of the private sector.as well
as efficient public sector management. Brief descriptions of
the priorities and Bank activities to address them follow.

Poverty Reduction

Although the Asian and Pacific region has had rapid
economic growth during the 1980s, more than half of the
world’s poor still live here. The number ranges from 400
million io 700 million depending on how poverty is
measured, and in several Asian DMCs poverty continues to
de endemic.

Economic growth is a necessary but not a sufficient
condition for poverty reduction. Helping the poor with
targeted and direct income-generating opportunities as well

therefore. is likely to yield as good, if not better, economic
retums to a DMC as investing. say, in a road.

Since the Bank's inception in 1966, poverty reduction
has been an implicit element in its operations. Its concerns
were sharpened by the findings and recommendations of an
internal Task Force on the Bank's Role in Poverty
Alleviation, established in 1988. A comprehensive action
plan has been developed to ensure that the new policy

. components are fully integrated with all Bank operations.

Poverty issues are now considered systematically during
country strateay and operational programming exercises,
and an increasing number of projects and programs are
being aimed at meeting specific poverty reduction goals.

There are two elements in the Bank’s policy. The first
is to pay special attention to poverty reduction issues when
formulating and implementing conventional projects. The
second is -to initiate "core’ poverty reduction projects
specifically focusing on impoverished groups. The Bank is
increasingly concerned with projects which will increase
income and employment opportunities for the poor and
improve their access to basic social services, such as
education and health care. It also supports policy
adjustments to involve the poor in the development process.

Altogether 34 projects with partial or exclusive focus
on poverty reduction were approved in 1992, Bangladesh,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka being the major recipients. About
47 per cent of the projects were in the agriculture sector
covering irrigation, forestry, fisheries and rural
development, and 53 per cent in the infrastructure sector
including education, health and population, water supply
and urban developrnent. Projects such as the Small Farmers
Credit Project in the Philippines and the Participatory
Forestry Project in Sri Lanka were specifically designed to
increase the income and employment opportunities for
target beneficiaries. while the Central Java and
DI. Yogyakarta Urban Development {Sector} Project in
Indonesia and the Third Water Supply and Sanitation Sector
Project in Nepa! were aimed at addressing the basic needs
of the poor. The goal for the Bank is to provide about
20 per cent of new commitments from both ADF and OCR
for activities explicitly addressing poverty reduction. The
Bank will also heip DMCs design end implement
comprehensive strategies, programs and proiecis in this
regard.

 

7Women in Development

The Bank believes that the role and needs of women
should be an integral part of project activity not only for
reasons of equity but also for development to remain
sustainable. The Bank's policy on the role of women in
development (WID) was adopted in 1985 arid directs that
this role should be considered at every stage of operations

and the project cycle. In line with the Bank's Medium-Term:

Strategic Framework, efforts are being made to address WID
objectives through (i) macro-level dialogue with DMCs to
enhance their awareness and build up their capacities in this
regard, (ii) systematic integration of gender analysis into
Bank activity, and (iii) monitoririg the benefits and impact of
such efforts.

During the year, one agriculture and agro-industry

project and four social infrastructure projects (education, _

health and population, water supply and urban
development) were: approved containing significant
elements designed to improve the role of women in
development. These were the Second Rural Infrastructure
Development Project’in Bangladesh, the Third Water
Supply and Sanitation Sector Project in Nepal, the Teacher
Training Project in Pakistan, the Second Health and
Population Project and the Fisheries Sector Project, both in
Sri Lanka.

Community participation to enhance the role of women
was emphasized in 21 technical assistance projects
approved during the year covering agriculture, education,
health and population, water supply and sanitation, and
urban development. A regional technical assistance for
Education of Women in Asia was approved to develop a
framework for regional strategies to promote women's
education and their potential in the economic and
development sectors. A draft report on "Women in
Development Indicators for Asian and Pacific Countries,"
also prepared under a regional technical assistance, was
completed and being processed for issuance.

Even for projects where a specific WID component was
not required or might not have been appropriate, gender
issues were rigorously analyzed during project preparation.
A training seminar was conducted for professional staff to
acquaint them with the purposes and methods of identifying
and assessing gender-related issues. Efforts to improve the
depth and quality of such analysis continued and were given
additional emphasis.

Cooperation with NGOs

There is increasing recognition that NGOs are
important agents of change able to complement
government agencies in their development efforts. NGOs
often work with the people at the grassroots level and as
such are familiar with their specific needs and can promote
self-help and self-reliance. In many instances, NGOs may

have a distinct advantage over public agencies in identifying
felt needs and in delivering goods and services to the
hard-to-reach segrnents of the population in an efficient and
cost-effective manner. There are many well established
NGOs in the DMCs with extensive expertise and experience
to become effective partners in development. This has

prompted the Bank to collaborate with NGOs in its

operations. In the 1980s, it started working with
international and national NGOs in such areas as
environment, poverty reduction and WID, and shared the
experience of national NGOs in preparing projects in DMCs
like Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan and Philippines.
A policy on cooperation with NGOs was formulated and
adopted in 1987. In 1992, the Bank approved a total of
10 loans which would involve NGOs to assist in community
development, help train and organize beneficiaries, and act
as credit intermediaries.

The Bank also funded a study which assessed the role
and impact of NGOs in Bangladesh and contributed to an
intensive dialogue between the Government, NGOs and the
donor community.

Encouraged by the positive response from the first
NGO Consultative Meeting on Environment held in 1989,
the Bank organized a second such meeting in October 1992.
The outcome of this meeting indicated that collaboration
with NGOs should increase and their role as development
partners would have to be further strengthened.

Social Infrastructure

Investment in education, health and population
programs, particularly those designed to benefitlower-income groups, has clear economic and development
advaniages. For example, by improving cognitive skills, basic
education equips an individual to absorb further training and
thus helps create a productive and adaptable workforce so
essential for sustained economic growth. Similarly,
secondary and higher education can contribute to increased
national productivity, as can programs to create a healthier
workforce. Investments in maternal and child health and
nutrition, as well as efforts directed toward achieving a
smaller family size and greater birth spacing not only
improve the well-being of children in the short term but also
serve to enhance their income-eaming potential over tirne.
Education and health programs, therefore, are highly cost
effective, although projecis in these sectors tend to have
longer gestation periods and can be more difficult to process
and administer. Access, quality, equity, efficiency and
financing are some of the major issues which need to be
addressed within individual projects.

Education: Expansion of primary and secondary
education continues to be the priority concern of many
DMCs. The Bank is increasingly emphasizing projects in
primary or basic education to help boost literacy rates and
increase women’s participation in education. The
Rehabilitation of Damaged School Facilities Project in
Bangladesh, the Secondary Education Development Project
in Nepal, the education component of the Special
Rehabilitation Assistance Project in Cambodia, the Teacher
Training Project and the technical assistance project on
Lower Secondary Education in Pakistan are examples of the
Bank's efforts in this respect.

- Ee Sa ose
LEARNING to read and w Bhutan. Expansion of primary
and secondary education is an important priority for the Bank.

 

  
 

 

During the year, the Bank provided technical assistance
grants to Lao PDR and Mongolia to help them adapt their
educational systems and curricula to meet the challenges of
rapidly changing economic and social conditions.

Structural reforms, better access and quality
improvements in general secondary education were
addressed in the loan approved during the year for the Junior
Secondary Education Project in Indonesia. Strengthening or
re-orientation of secondary-level technical and vocational
components is necessary to make such education more
relevant to labor market requirements. Technica! and
vocational education has proven io be an effective means of
improving labor productivity and reducing poverty. The
Bank’s efforts in this regard were reflected in the technical
assistance to Sri Lanka for the Second Technical Education
Project and to Indonesia for the Third Vocational Education
Project.

In the field of higher education, the efficiency and
effectiveness of the system can be improved by rationalizing
and consolidating the number and type of institutions and
making curricula more responsive. The Bank has financed
a number of projects to achieve these objectives, including
the Bangladesh Open University Project approved in 1992.
Two technical assistance grants to Indonesia for the Outer
Islands Universities Project and the Second Surabaya
Institute of Technology Project provide other examples of
the Bank's effort to improve higher education in its DMCs.

A gradual shift can be noticed in the Bank’s approach
to education projects. With a greater emphasis on quality
improvement and rationalization, the projects are
increasingly moving away from a predominantly hardware
orientation (civil works and equipment} to a predominanily
software (curriculum review and systems and manpower
development} approach. The Bank has also begun to
explore, through technical assistance, the means to extend
direct assistance to private education providers. It approved
two grants.in 1992 for Indonesia and Lao PDR to support
studies to develop basic policy frameworks to permit private
schools to complement the existing public education system.

One other Bank activity in support of human resource
development in its DMCs deserves mention: the Japan-ADB
Scholarship Program: Funded by the Government of Japan,
the program finances postgraduate study in management,
technology and other development-related fields at leading
regional institutions. During 1992/93, the Government of
Japan contributed about $2 million under the program to
finance 64 new and 67 continuing scholarships.

Health and Population: Bank projects in this
subsector are aimed at improving the access to and the
quality and efficiency .of primary health care and family
planning services in sural and urban areas. They are also
designed to ensure the effective functioning of health referral
networks. The health needs of children and young mothers
ave particularly targeted and the allocation of Bank resources

 

1 aeE

 

“81 50

ANNUAL REPORT 1992

is shifting from the expansion of physical infrastructure to
building more effective health care institutions. The Second
Health and Population Project in Sri Lanka and the Health
Care Development Project in Pakistan, approved in 1992,
are examples of that effort.

* Universal access and sustainability are the major
elemenis of the Bank's health sector program. The Bank
believes that health sector management and financing
systems must be strengthened and resource allocation
policies must be made cost-effective and equitable. A
technical assistance grant was approved during the year for
the Philippines to help transfer the responsibility for health
service delivery from the national to local governments.

At the same time, the Bank is aware that new health
challenges, such as AIDS, are emerging as major health
and economic issues in Asia.: Through regional technical
assistance, it is providing its DMCs with information
and analyses on AIDS as a basis for resource allocation
decisions.

Water Supply and Sanitation: The Bank's
objectives behind its water supply projects are to increase
the coverage of the urban poor, ensure reasonable supplies
of safe water, promote water resource management and
reduce waste. These objectives were reflected in the Third
Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project in Nepal, the
Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Vientiane Water Supply
Project in Lao PDR, the Rehabilitation and Upgrading of
Water Supply Systems Project in Malaysia, the Third Urban
Water Supply Project in Papua New Guinea, and the
technical assistance loan for the Umiray-Angat Transbasin
Project in the Philippines. Two regional technical assistance
projects - Managing Water Resources to Meet Megacity
Needs and the Water Utilities Data Book for Asian and
Pacific Region - were approved to provide guidance to the
DMCs on invesiments in water supply.

At the same time, Bank projects are increasingly aimed
at integrating water pollution control and service expansion
with better drainage and solid waste disposal, as reflected in
the Water Pollution Control Project in Indonesia, approved
in 1992.

Technical assistance grants for the Punjab Rural Water
Supply and Saniiation Project in Pakistan and the Small

Towns Water Supply Project in Thailand, approved during

the year, are examples of how the Bank uses its rural water

* supply projects to promote community participation and

a grassroots approach in the operation and maintenance of
facilities.

Urbanization: As discussed in greater detail in the

‘chapter on "Challenges of Urbanization in the Asia-Pacific

Region,” the Bank's objective is to help strengthen basic
infrastructure (e.g., water supply, sanitation, drainage, solid
waste management, roads and land development} to enable
DMCs to cope with problems generated by rapid

 

urbanization. Improving living conditions in slums and
squatter settlements is also an important element of the
Bank's urban development projects. The Central Java and
DI. Yogyakarta Urban Development (Sector) Project in
Indonesia, the Urban Development Sector Project in
Sri Lanka, the Bangkok Urban Transport Project in
Thailand, the Shanghai-Yangpu Bridge Project in PRC and
the Secondary Towns Integrated Flood Protection Project in
Bangladesh reflected the Bank’s efforts in this regard.

Environment and Natural
Resources Management

The United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in
dune forged agreements expected to influence the policies,
projects and programs of both developing and developed
countries, international organizations and development
finance institutions like the Bank. These developments were
taken into account in formulating the Bank’s strategic
environmental agenda for the 1990s.

The number of loan projects with environmental
orientation continued to rise during the year. The major
emphasis of these projects ranged from pollution control in
the indusiry and power sectors, energy conservation and
energy efficiency to integrated urban environmental
development, tropical forest management and biodiversity
conservation. These concerns were particularly reflected in

  

oe St Ye

PLANTING high-yielding and quick-growing species of tropical
trees is an essential part of the Second Compensatory Forestry
Sector Project in Malaysia, funded by a $29.5 million Bank loan
from OCR,the Biodiversity Conservation, Marine Resource Evaluation
and Planning, and Water Pollution Control projects in
Indonesia; the Energy Conservation and Environmental
Improvement Project in India; the Industrial Energy
Conservation and Environmental Improvement, and
Qingdao Environmental Improvement projects in PRC, and
the Urban Development Sector Project in Sri Lanka.
Capacity and institution-building activities continued
under the broad themes of environmental and resource
management and environmental impact assessment. These
activities covered PRC, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR,

Malaysia, Marshall Islands and Mongolia. The Bank also |

assisted the South Pacific DMCs in preparing their national
reports to UNCED. In addition, it assisted Indonesia, the
Hindu Kush Himalayan countries and Lower Mekong Basin
riparian countries in improving and establishing
management tools, such as geographic information system
(GIS), to expand their capability for environmental and
resource management. Several other DMCs were helped to
prepare national strategies to deal with climate change.

Studies were also conducted for the establishment of an
effective environmental monitoring network and the
enforcement of environmental quality standards in
Indonesia; vehicular emission control in the Philippines and
the preparation of environmental investment plans for
Thailand. Recognizing that concessional funds for financing
environmental projects might be scarce in the future, the
Bank launched a siudy to explore possible alternative
financing mechanisms and modalities.

The environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedure
of the Bank, requiring assessment reports on
environmentally sensitive projects to be submitted before
Board consideration, was further strengthened and a revised
Operations Manual section on environment was issued. Field
visits to verify the recommendations made in the summary
environmental assessment reports were made in a majority
of these environmentally sensitive projects. Participation in
country project review and post-evaluation missions
provided an opportunity to review and monitor significant
environmental concerns during project implementation and
post-evaluation. Lessons derived from this experience
will be integrated in the design of future programs and
projects.

A user design study for a computerized Environmenial
Management Information System, a system to track the
environmental treatment of projects throughout the project
cycle, has now been completed and environmental
information has become an integral part of the Project
Processing Information Sysiem of the Bank.

Environment sector work continued to be emphasized
and provided a significant input to country strategy anc
country programming exercises. Such work covered the
Pacific island DMCs. Bangladesn, India, Maidives. Mongolia.
Pakistan, Thaiiand and Viet Nem, and wes considered an

Significant progress was made in the area of regional
and international cooperation. The Bank participated in the
preparatory and follow-up work in connection with the
UNCED-led move among regional development banks
(RDBs) to define an active role for themselves in
implernenting projects covered by the Global Environment
Facility (GEF). Cooperation with environmental NGOs was
strengthened following discussions with them at the Bank's
annual meeting in Hong Kong and at the second ADB-NGO
Consultative Meeting on Environment and Natural Resource
Management in Manila. In several major environmentrelated activities, the Bank maintained close relationships
with other donors, particularly LNDP, United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP}, World Heaith
Organization (WHO), and Economic and Social Commission
for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).

In response to the UNCED cail for MDBs to help
deveioping countries meet their post-UNCED
commitments. the Bank prepared a strategy and a course of

follow-up actions in line with Agenda 21 program areas, the
framework agreement on climate change and biodiversity
conventions. Issues related to financing these actions and
mechanisms for implementation will be addressed in the
future.

The initiatives taken in 1992 will lay the ground for the
achievement of one of the Bank’s- major development
objectives: sound management of the environment and
natural resources. A major focus of the Bank’s
environmental program next year will be on improving the
mix between traditional activities and projecis/programs to
reduce poverty, develop human resources and protect the
environment. A fuller integration will be sought of
environmental considerations in country operational
strategy studies and country operational programming.

‘

Strategic Planning

The Bank has established a process of strategic
planning in order to be better able to respond to the needs
of its DMCs and meet its major development objectives as
outlined in the beginning of this chapter. In promoting these
objectives, the Bank emphasizes, the role of the private
sector as well as public sector management.

The strategic planning approach applies to al] Bank
tending, technical assistance and economic and sector work.
At the center of this approach are country strategies and
country programming, being sharpened and made more
analytical to address the priority concerns of the DMCs. The
Bank’s sector strategies are being realigned accordingly.

The Three-Year Rolling Work Plan with Budget
Implications provides details of how the Bank's development
objectives are applied to individual DMCs and constitutes the
Bank's medium-term strategic plan. The overall mediumterm goal is to achieve a roughly 50/50 lending mix of
traditional activities and newer efforts like poverty reduction,
human resource development and environmental
protection. Resource allocation in the Bank’s 1993 Budget
reflects a major step towards executing the strategic plan.

Social Dimensions

To more systematically integrate cross-cutting issues of
social significance into its operations, the Bank established
a Social Dimensions Unit (SDU} in April. Social dimensions
are identified to include poverty reduction, women in
development, human resource development and the
avoidance or mitigation of any adverse effects of
development interventions on vulnerable groups who do not
have the ability to absorb such shocks. As mentioned earlier,
a participatory approach to development, gender and social

analysis, benefit monitoring and evaluation and cooperation
with NGOs are essential elements in the Bank's efforts to
operationalize these issues,

The major goal of SDU is to help Bank staff and DMCs
incorporate these social dimensions and associated
processes in their operations so that these become
institutionalized, It will develop methodological approaches
to operationalize the social dimensions through policy
papers, guidelines, manuals and briefing materials. A system
will be installed for monitoring the Bank’s operations
accordingly, appropriate reports will be prepared and
necessary support will be provided to the Prograrns and
Projects Departments throughout the project cycle. The
exercise will begin with the preparation of country strategy
studies and country programming without, however,
impeding the pace of operational activities. If important
social dimensions and associated pracesses are found not to
have been adequately addressed ‘in an activity, SDU will
advise on pragmatic ways of. incorporating these aspects
during subsequent phases. After adequate progress has been
achieved within the Bank on incorporating the social
dimensions and associated processes in its operations, SDU
would extend its efforts to work with governmental and
non-governmental agencies in the Bank's DMCs.

Country Strategies

The Bank’s country strategy studies provide the basis
for its operations in the medium term and reflect DMCs’
plans, priorities, constraints and policy environments as well
as its own broad concerns about protection of the
environment, poverty reduction and the role of women in
development. The studies also set out the Bank’s thinking
on how best it can contribute to DMCs’ economic growth
in the light of its Medium-Term Strategic Framework
(1992-1995).

The borrowing DMCs cover a wide spectrum and are
at different stages of development. However, even though
their requirements are widely divergent, most of them are
going through certain common intersectoral changes
associated with shifts from rural to urban environmenis,
from agriculture to industry to services, and from domestic
to international trade. This underlines the need for a focused
and prioritized country approach on the part of the Bank,
given its limited resources.

The Bank has adopted a policy of revising its country
strategies every three to five years. In 1992, strategy studies
were ongoing for Cook Islands, Fiji and Tonga, while these
for Federated States of Micronesia, Papua New Guinea and
Philippines were initiated. A medium-term operational
strategy was underway for Bangladesh and the strategies for
Nepal and Thailand were being revised.5

inckided supplementary amounts of ¥1.77 billion, which
were used to enhance activities related to environmental
protection (¥1 billion}, women-in-development
(¥250 million), private sector support {¥500 million) and
seminars and symposia (¥24.06 million).

During 1992, total technical assistance amounted to

48 per cent and 73 per cent of the OCK and ADF loans
approved, respectively.

Country-specific grants to DMCs accounted for
$93.8 million of the total grant assistance in 1992, an
increase of 3 per cent from 1991 (for sectoral breakdown,
see Statistical Annex). Group A (low-income) DMCs received
74 per cent of the country-specific grants (62 per cent in
1991), with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as the
major recipierit. Group B (middle-income) DMCs received
24 per cent (35 per cent in 1991), Indonesia being the major
recipient. Group C (higher-income) DMCs accounted for the
remaining 2 per. cent (3 per cent im 1991).

Of the loan-financed technical assistance of
$370 million, incorporated in loan projects, 91 per cent was
provided for advisory and project implementation purposes
and 9 per cent for project preparation. Group A DMCs
received about 40 per cent of the total technical assistance
loans (30 per cent in 1991), Group B DMCs 58 per cent

Review of Operations

Government and Government-guaranteed loans to the
public sector in 1992 included project, program and sector

loans, credit lines through development finance institutions ,

{DF ls) for industry and agritulture, and emergency loans for
disaster rehabilitation. The total of $5,059 million was an
increase of 10 per cent-from the revised 1991 figure of
$4,594 million, and included $3,904.4 million from OCR
{an increase of 20 per cent) and $1,155 million from ADF
fa decrease of 14 per cent}. While OCR loans accounted for
77 per cent of all public sector loans (against 71 per cent in
1991), ADF loans made up 23 per cent (down from
29 per cent in 1991}. Altogether, 66 public sector loans
were approved for 64 projects in 17 DMCs, against 63 loans
for 62 projects in 17 DMCs a year earlier.

The growth in public sector lending was due mainly to
an increased number of sector and disaster rehabilitation
loans. Eleven sector loans were approved for a total of
$1,074.25 million, which accounted for 21 per cent of the
total 1992 lending and reflected an increase of 61 per cent
over 1991. Emergency loans for disaster rehabilitation were
provided to five DMCs for a total of $161.1 million, about
six times the previous year’s figure of $28.8 million.
Program loans during the year totalled $580 million,
about 33 per cent more than in the previous year.

b In addition, $250 million co-financing was arranged for a loan
approved previously.

  
  

Of this, 95 per cent was from OCR and 5 per cent from
ADF.

The decline in concessionary lending was temporary in
nature and reflected in part the coming into office of new
governments in several ADF-borrowing countries and the
need for the Bank to re-establish dialogue with them. It also

- reflected the Bank’s emphasis on the implementation of

ongoing projects.

The average size of the year’s loans to the public sector
was $77 million, slightly higher than $73 million in 1991,

During the year, the Bank recommenced operations in
Cambodia by approving three technical assistance projects
anda special rehabilitation assistance loan for $67.7 million.
These were the first Bank operations in Cambodia since
1970.

Lending to the agriculture sector {including natural
resource management and rural development) covered 16
projects for a total amount of $683.6 million. With a
13 per cent share of the Bank's total lending, the sector
formed the fourth largest segment of Bank activity.

The year was particularly significant for the agriculture
sector as its emphasis shifted to natural resource
management and issues of sustainability and poverty
reduction, while maintaining attention on agricultural
productivity, sectoral efficiency and value-adding activities.
In addition, special assistance was mobilized to meet
emergency situations in a number of DMCs.

Inthe area of natural resource management, the Bank
designed and financed a number of innovative projects
addressing critical environmental conservation needs. These
included the Forestry Sector Project in the Philippines as a
follow-up to the initial Forestry Sector Program approved in

-1988, and the Biodiversity Conservation in Flores and

Siberut Project in Indonesia focusing on two of the country’s

‘important geographic regions. In addition, a Marine

Resources Evaluation and Planning Project was also
approved for Indonesia for institutional strengthening in the
planning and management of coastal marine areas. The
Participatory Forestry Project and the Fisheries Sector
Project approved for Sri Lanka were designed to mobilize
the help of local communities in managing their resources
more responsibly and on a sustainable basis.

The focus of poverty reduction and rural
development activities was on poor rural communities and
sought to address their severe socioeconomic constraints.
The Small Farmers Credit Project in the Philippines
approved during the year was designed to make much
needed credit and technical assistance available to small
farmers, many of whom are tenants and essentially assetless.
The Upland Farmer Development Project in Indonesia was
intended to assist poor small farmers in adopting farming
systems which are environmentally benign though
economically more productive.

In Bangladesh, the Rural Infrastructure Project was
expected to give many poor and remote farmers greater

Among the traditional agriculture projects approved
during the year were the Guangdong Tropical Crops
Development Project in PRC, the Smallholder Tree Crop
Processing Project in Indonesia and the North-West Frontier
Province Barani Area Development Project in Pakistan. The
projects were focused on low-income farmer groups and
designed to enhance agricultural productivity through the
provision of technical inputs and the strengthening of
beneficiary groups and government institutions.

The Bank also approved a program loan for Lao PDR
(the Second Agricultural Program Loan), intended to assist
in policy restructuring and institutional development.

Two irrigation projects were approved for Bangladesh
(the Second Bhola Irrigation Project) and Sri Lanka (the
North Western Province Water Resources Development
Project), both intended fo improve agricultural production
and productivity in socioeconomically backward areas.

Altogether, 49 technical assistance grants totalling
$26.6 million were approved, of which 22 were project
preparatory grants related to on-farm water management,
rainfed agricultural development, mangrove and coastal
zone management, forestry program formulation and
tropical crop development. The remaining 27 were
advisory in nature, meant for institutional strengthening,
training, skills development and strategy studies.

For the second year in succession, energy had the
largest share of the Bank's total lending. The sector received
12 government-guaranteed loans (totalling to
$1,441 million} and one private sector loan of $50 million.
In addition, 25 technical assistance grants {totalling to
$11.8 million) were approved.

Two of the loans totalling $35.3 million financed the
engineering/consiruction of environmentally sound
hydropower projects in Lao PDR and Mongolia. Four loans
{$591.3 million) financed improvements to facilities for
transmission and distribution of electricity in India,

financed increases in power generation capacity using fossil
fuels (coal in Indonesia and oil in East Malaysia). The fossil
fuel options were demonstrated to be least-cost options and
carefully environmental mitigation measures were
incorporated. One loan in Thailand was for natural gas
transmission ($58 million) which would enable power
generation based on combined-cycle units. The $50 million
loan to PRC will enable the construction of a thermal power
plant by a company with substantial private sector
Participation.

Three loans amounting to $357 million were approved
for energy conservation and environmental improvement
projects in PRC and India. These projects were designed
specifically to encourage a more efficient use of energy,
reduce industrial pollution, introduce modern energy
management systems and provide financial incentives for
investment in energy conservation and environmental
improvement.

In addition, a multisector special rehabilitation
assistance loan to Cambodia contained an $18.2 million
component to rehabilitate the power system in the capital
region.

Of ihe 25 technical assistance grants, five were for
project preparation and 20 for advisory purposes. The
activities covered by these grants included, among other
things, the development of renewable energy, energy
efficiency and environmental planning, monitoring and
mitigation. |

In the industry and non-fuel minerals sector, one

loan of $133 million was approved during the year for the
Laivar Iron and Steel Modernization and Expansion Project
in PRC. Ten technical assistance projects totalling about
$3.4 million were also approved, intended to strengthen
institutions, restructure and privatize public sector
enterprises, promote energy conservation, control industrial
pollution and help formulate appropriate industrial policy
reforms, /

Loans to the financial sector amounted to
$671.5 million against $375 million in 1991. They
constituted 13 per cent of the year’s total lending and
comprised financial sector program loans ($550 million} and
loans to financial institutions ($121.5 million). In addition,
the Bank made four equity investments in financial
institutions amounting to $10.6 million and approved 18
technical assistance grants totalling $5.4 million.

The program loans provided the Bank with an opportunity fo undertake policy dialogue with DMC governments
to improve the performance of the financial sector through
adjustments in policy, better investment programs and
institutional enhancement. The emphasis was on broadbased reform plans. For example, the Second Financial
Sector Program Joan to indonesia ($250 million) approved
during the year was aimed at supporting the development
of long-term financial markets in Indonesia in order to
increase domestic resource mobilization and narrow the
invesiment-savings gap. The main concerns of the program
were the application and enforcement of appropriate
safeguards, and the creation of a basic legal, regulatory andsupervisory framework. It was also intended to promote
intermediation efficiency through a greater play of market
forces in the capital market, particularly the bond market.
The Financial Sector Program loan to India ($300 million)
was designed to achieve a diversified, competitive and
market-based financial sector in order to raise the allocative
efficiency of available savings, increase the return on investments and accelerate the development of the real economy.
The program also supported increased participation of the
private sector, strong prudential regulations and better
supervision of financial institutions and markets. Its other
specific objectives were to improve the private sector's
access to financial savings, reduce intermediation costs and
distortions in the banking system, promote competition
through a level playing field and a treer entry-and-exit system
in the banking and development finance institution (DFI)
sectors, improve the autonomy and financial soundness of
banks and DFls, develop the government securities and

money markets, and strengthen the capital markets. It is

expected that the reforms sought by the program will have
a wide impact on the economy since the financial system
will become more competitive and diversified, and better
able to offer a wider array of financial services.

The loans to financial institutions included a second line
of credit to the Cook Islands Development Bank
($1.5 million) for ondending to private sector projects in
fourism, agriculture, fisheries, industry and services, and a

BANK OPERATIONS

loan to PRC ($120 million) for an Industrial Technology
Finance Project. The latter project will provide three
non-bank financial institutions with long-term foreign
exchange resources to support new, resource-efficient and

-environment-friendly technologies in industry. Its targets are
small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly those in the .

non-state sector, a key elernent in PRC’s enterprise reform.

Lending for transport and communications in
the public sector amounted to $1.22 billion for 11 projects.
The roads subsector accounted for $481.7 million and
included loans to Fiji ($18 million) for road upgrading;
Pakistan ($165.4 million) for the rehabilitation/upgrading
of provincial highways; PRC for the Shanghai-Yangpu
Bridge ($85 million) and for the construction of a highway
from Shenyang to Benxi ($50 million): and Thailand for a
sector project ($93 million) and for urban road construction
($70.3 million).

A transport infrastructure development loan, covering
boih roads and ports, was made to Papua New Guinea
($69 million). There was one loan in the ports subsector for
acoal port project in India ($285 million). Under the railways
subsector, PRC received a loan of $200 million for
expansion of its railway network. A loan of $185 million
was made to Indonesia for telecommunications development
and $0.5 million was provided to Cook Islands for
emergency rehabilitation of telecommunications facilities
destroyed by fire.

Support for the Private Sector

In the strategic development agenda of the Bank, the
private sector is seen as the main vehicle for economic
growth in its DMCs. One of the priority objectives of the
Bank's medium-term planning, therefore, is to help the
DMCs establish a healthy environment for the private
sector's growth. This is done mainly through discussions and
dialogue with DMC governments on various aspects of
policy and the siatutory, regulatory and fiscal frameworks
that have @ bearing on the growth and developmen: of the

 

 

EOL Social. ue M

private sector. The Bank’s dialogue with DMCs has been
focused on foreign investment policies and regulations

’ (Gncluding the level of foreign equity ownership, taxation and

repatriation of dividends and capital gains), as well as policy
reforms and other measures needed to develop the securities
markets.

Since the beginning of its operations in 1968, the Bank
has provided credit lines to selected DMC financial
intermediaries for on-lending to small and medium private
enterprises by means of government-guaranteed loans.
Rural credit, which is a substantial component of the Bank's
agricultural lending, also benefits the private sector. Support
for the private sector was enhanced in 1983 by introducing
an equity investment facility, which allowed the Bank to
make direct equity investments in private enterprises and
financial institutions, and extend lines of equity to selected
financial intermediaries. In 1985, the Bank reinforced its
assistance to the private sector by establishing a facility for
direct lending to private enterprises without government
guarantee, and in 1989 a Private Sector Department was
created to act as the focal point of private sector activities
in the Bank. A further step was taken in 1992 with the
integration of private sector operations in the Bank's overall
operational activities and the creation of a Private Sector
Support Unit in the Private Sector Department. The Unit
will (a) advise on privatization, financing of projects through
build-operate-transfer (BOT) or build-operate-own (BOO)
schemes and capital markets: (b) assist operationalANNUAL REPORT i992

Department have been redeployed to Resident Offices in
Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and Pakistan to help evaluate
and process private sector projects.

While creating a favorable economic and policy
environment is the basic objective, the Bank's second
objective is to accelerate private sector development through
BOT/BOO projects in the power, roads and
telecommunications sectors, and through the privatization
of state-owned enterprises. Besides, the private sector also
benefits from the services for industrial and commercial
development ihat many of the Bank's infrastructure and

assistance to financial and commercial enterprises having a
developmental, demonstrative and catalytic impact, by way
of loans without government guarantee and equity
investments. .

In 1992, the Bank approved a total of $737 million in
both public and private sector projects which directly and
indirectly benefited the private sector. This represented an
increase of 47 per cent over 1991, and included
$671.5 million in financial sector program loans and loans
to financial institutions, processed by the Private Sector
Department.

The year’s direct assistance to the private sector without
government guarantee amounted to $66 million for five
projects, comprising $11 million in equity investments, a
$50 million loan for a power station in PRC, referred toearlier under the energy sector, and $5 million in
underwriting. In addition, complementary financing
amounting to $81.5 million was arranged for loans which
had been approved in 1991.

Equity funds were provided io a Pakistan Privatization
Fund, which will invest in the securities of state-owned
enterprises that have been or are in the process of being
privatized, a DFI undergoing privatization and a venture
capital company in Sri Lanka; and a regional privatization
fund which will invest in commercially promising
state-owned companies which are in the process of being
privatized.

Additionally, as part of its efforts io develop capital.
markets in the DMCs, the Bank approved 20 technical
assistance grants totalling $5.59 million. These grants
covered financial advisory services for national electronic

enterprises in Western Samoa and Pakistan; feasibility study
for a long-term credit bank in Maldives; and the development
of the stock and corporate bond markets and institutional
strengthening of the securities and exchange commission in
the Philippines. Regional technical assistance grants were
approved for training staff of South Pacific DFls in project
supervision; promoting privatization in DMCs; a capital
market conference; study of securities market regulations
and supervision; and training on the development and
regulation of emerging capital markets.

Co-Financing and Guarantee Operations

A total of 22 Bank-assisted loan projects and programs
were co-financed in 1992, or about 34 per cent of loans
approved during the year. For the first time, the total amount
of co-financing exceeded the three-billion mark and reached
$3.150 million, more than double the 1991 figure of
$1,437 million. The Bank's own lending to the co-financed
projects amounted to $2,648 million, comprising
$2,094 million for projects in 1992 and $554 million for
those approved in previous years.

Official sources of co-financing, other than
officially-supported export credits, contributed
$2,133 million, a 287 per cent increase from 1991. Of
this, about $1.216 million was provided by muitiiaierai
agencies and $917 million by bilateral agencies.
Co-financing from commercial sources amounted to
$272 million, an increase of 53 ner cent, while co-financing
from export credit agencies increased about 5 per cent to
$746 million. As of the end of the year. 360 Bank projecis
nad received co-financing for a cumulative total of
$13.9 billion

The Bank continued to exercise prudence in utilizing

 

the Complementary Financing Scheme (CFS) and guarantee
facilities. In 1992, the Bank arranged, through
CFS/guarantee, the second and third commercial
co-financing for PRC to finance the Yangpu Bridge Project
in Shanghai and the Laiwu Iron and Steel Mill Modernization
and Expansion Project in Shandong province.

In addition to co-financing for loan projects, the Bank
arranged with bilateral and multilateral sources, such as
Finland, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and
UNDP, a total of $12.4 million to co-finance or exclusively
finance 18 technical assistance projects, on a grant basis.
The Bank acts as the executing agency for technical
assistance projects financed from these sources.

Bank’s Role in Resource Transfer

The net transfer of resources (gross loan disbursements
less principal repayments and prepayments, payments of
interest and other charges plus net equity investments) from
the Bank to the DMCs decreased by 28 per cent from
$1,634 million in 1991 to $1,179 million in 1992 as a result
of a significant reduction in. loan disbursements and an
increase in loan repayments and payments of interest and
other charges. The Bank’s transfer accounted for about
11 per cent of the total net flows of financial resources to
the DMCs from all sources (bilateral,” multilateral and
private), compared with 13 per cent in 1991.

Of the toial net transfer, $432 million was from OCR
and $748 million from ADF, compared with $716 million
and $918 million in 1991, respectively. Although net
transfers from OCR continued to be positive, the amount
fell by 40 per cent from 1991. Net transfers from ADF

declined for the second consecutive year, showing a
decrease of about 19 per cent,

Gross loan disbursements decreased by 10.8 per cent
from $3.1 billion in 1991 to $2.8 billion in 1992 (of which
$1.9 billion was from OCR and $0.9 billion from ADF).
Disbursements under ADF loans decreased more rapidly
than those under OCR. The disbursement ratio
(excluding program loans) for all borrowing DMCs was
estimated at 15.1 per cent in 1992, compared with
20.4 per cent in 1991. Both OCR and ADF disbursements
under project and sector loans decreased, by 21 per cent
and 7 per cent, respectively, Although program loan
disbursements accounted for only 17 per cent of total disbursements, they posted a 33 per cent increase over 1991,
mainly because of considerable increase in disbursements to
India.

The major factors contributing to the lower level of
disbursements in 1992 were: (i) a substantial reduction in
disburserenis under special assistance (in 1991, there were
extraordinary disbursements under special assistance
projects to India and Mongolia and under the Gulf crisis
assistance projects to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and
Sri Lanka); (ii) a reduction in disbursements for traditional
projects, particularly in India and Indonesia; {iti) a slowdown
in project implementation causéd by non-project factors
such as floods in Pakistan and change of government in the
Philippines; {iv} shortage of local currency funds, reflecting
the impact of the stabilization and adjustment programs
being undertaken by sore major borrowing DMCs, such as

India and Pakistan; {v) changes in the composition of loans,
with an emphasis on social sector projects which require
more time for project implementation; and (vi) the Bank’s

restrictions on the level of advance procurement and.

retroactive financing, which has been a rneans of expediting
project implementation in some DMCs, notably PRC, in
recent years.

In 1992, Bangladesh, PRC, India, Indonesia and
Pakistan were the five major recipients of Bank resources,
accounting for about 92 per cent of the total net transfers.
With the exception of Bangladesh and Republic of Korea,
all the major borrowing DMCs experienced a decline in net
resource transfers from the Bank in 1992. The increase in
the case of Bangladesh reflected the joint efforts of the
Government and the Bank’s Resident Office to improve
project administration and implementation. The borrowing
DMCs that experienced negative net transfers were
Cambodia, Fiji, Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand. In the
case of Thailand, advance repayment was a major
contributing factor. Malaysia has reduced its dependence on
official development assistance in recent years and hence
has had negative net transfers from the Bank since 1984.
Myanmar has been a non-active borrower since 1987. Thus,
in the absence of new loans, disbursernents could not match
principal repayments and payments of service charge. Fiji's
loan repayments and payments of interest and commitment
charges far exceeded loan disbursements.

Indonesia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea and
Philippines have access to both OCR and ADF resources.While the former two DMCs continued to experience
positive net transfers from both OCR and ADF, the latter
iwo registered negative flows of OCR resources and positive
flows of ADF resources in 1992. Since the positive ADF
flows more than offset the negative OCR flows, Papua New
Guinea and Philippines showed modest amounts of positive
net transfers overall.

The Republic of Korea received a positive net transfer
of OCR resources. Singapore and Taipei,China have been
in the net repayment phase for several years. Hong Kong
had completed its loan repayments and interest payment on
Bank loans in 1988.

Lending and Operational Policies

The Bank continued its efforts to evolve its operational
policies in response to the changing needs and imperatives
of its DMCs and the international environment.

The Board of Directors reviewed the existing policy on
guarantee operations to assess its effectiveness. Guarantee
operations undertaken so far by the Bank have yielded
considerable benefits to borrowers in terms of maturity
siretching, longer grace periods and lower interest rate
spreads than would have been feasible owing to
considerations of sovereign risk. The review cited that the
Bank's catalytic role assisted in mobilizing an additional
$218 million from commercial sources for
projects/programs during 1992.

Appropriaie procedures were developed for regular
review and approval by the Board of releases of program
loan tranches. The procedures involve the preparation of
progress reports giving data on program implementation
and compliance with conditionalities for the Board’s
information in cases where tranche release conditionalities
have been met, or for the Board's approval on a
no-objection basis where tranche release is proposed
aithough compliance with conditionalities has been
incomplete.

Following the culmination of negotiations for ADF VI
and the adoption of ADF VI: Report of the Donors, the
operational policy guidelines for ADF lending in 1992-1995
were set forth in a Board document, Arrangements for
Lending from ADF and TASF Operations Funded by ADF,
Contributions, The paper examined the considerations
governing the allocation of ADF resources to the DMCs and
addressed the Bank's approach to the priority ereas
identified by the donors and the use of ADF earmarked for
TASF. ‘

The Report of tne Donors aiso reauired the Bank to
emphasize development performence as a criterion for the
allo: n of ADF resources. In this context, a paper entitled
Bank Operations and Country Performance was prepared
outlining a broad framework for relating performance to
socioeconomic cevelopment issues and performance

assessments to Bank operations. The institutional
arrangements for undertaking performance reviews of
DMCs were set in place for the actual implementation of
performance reviews and their integration into Bank
operations. The Board discussed several papers relating to
the proposed general capital increase {GCI IV), which would
provide the Bank with needed capital for operations during
the period 1994-1998._A number of important operational
policies are being examined, inchiding the Bank’s exposure
risks in borrowing DMCs. An interdeparimental group has
been established to develop an analytical framework for
identifying the indicators of country risk and examining the
issue of exposure limits.

Bank Operations in the South Pacific

The Bank's South Pacific Regional Office (SPRO) is
concerned with seven South Pacific DMCs (Cook Islands,
Fiji, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu and Western
Samoa). Besides project administration, it handles country
programming, economic and sector work, operational
strategy studies and aid coordination. In June 1992,
Management approved a regional technical assistance
project ($495,000) for macroeconomic, sector and policy
analyses in the region to help SPDMC governments improve
their policy formulation capabilities and to provide a basis
for enhanced policy dialogue between them and donor
agencies. Studies have already been undertaken for Kiribati,
Tonga and Vanuatu, and others are planned for 1993.
These studies should also prove useful as inputs for round
iable meetings organized by UNDP and the biennial regional
economic reports prepared by the World Bank.
in the South Pacific. }ts staff have attended various
consultative meetings with multilateral organizations and
major bilateral donors.

During the year, the Development Policy Office undertook a review of the 1989 Task Force recommendation,
endorsed by the subsequent Board Ad Hoc Working Group,
that a Small Pacific Island Fund be created to enable the
Bank to tackle problems unique to these countries but which
cannot suitably be dealt with using present Bank vehicles.
The Social Dimensions Unit in the Agriculture Department
is curren'ly studying the review to provide a further analysis
of tne sociocultural characieristics of SPDMC economic
systems.

EDRC Activities

During 1992, the Economics and Development
Resource Center (EDRC) maintained its role as the Bank's
research arm, while moving to become more ciosely

its development resource center function.

Through its research program, EDRC addressed
a range of topics relevant to economic development in the
region and to the Bank’s activities. Topics covered through
in-house research included the economic consequences of
aging; the East Asian experience in economic development;
population growth and economic development;
urbanization, population distribution and economic
development in Asia; exchange rate policies of
Asian countries; the relationship between gender and
poverty; the growth-stability relationship in Asian
developing countries; HIV/AIDS in Asia; regional
cooperation in South Asia; financial flows in Asian and
Pacific DMCs; and international factor movement and
economic welfare.

Regional technical assistance was used to address topics
such as financial sector policies; priority issues and policy
measures to reduce rural poverty; the role of multilateral
development banks; economic reforms in selected planned
Asian developing countries; impact assessment and policy
responses from the Gulf crisis, growth triangles in Asia,
critical issues and policy measures to address urban poverty;
and economic implications of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in
selected DMCs.

Sector-oriented research covered the estimation of
shadow pricing for project appraisal; disease impact
assessment; rural credit delivery systems; comrnodity price

 

projections; the economic analysis of education projects;
and the economic analysis and socioeconomic justification
of water supply projects.

Country-specific and regional research undertaken by
EDRC included development strategies for Nepal; economic
development in South Asia; the economic transition of
Mongolia; and the institutional development of the Ministry
of Finance in Bangladesh. ,

In addition to providing operational support through
research, EDRC also became more directly involved in the
actual work of the Programs and Projects Departments. It
undertook a macroeconomic modeling and forecasting
project, developed economic evaluation guidelines,
patticipated in country operational strategy studies, country
programming and appraisal missions, and helped execute
sector studies. At the same time it provided advisory
technical assistance to DMCs in several areas as well as
resource persons from its staff at local, regional and
international conferences and seminars.

An active technical assistance program was maintained
to assist DMCs in the development and strengthening of
statistical systems and services, with an increasing emphasis
on strategic areas such as poverty reduction, the
environment, women in development and social
development.

In addition to its technical assistance program, EDRC
continued to provide statistical services for users both within
and outside the Bank. Efforts to collect and consolidate
economic and social data and maintain a data base
continued, A major achievement during the year was the
operationalization of the computerized Statistical Data Base
System, providing on-line access to and updating of the
Bank’s statistical data base. Ties were maintained with other
international organizations for the exchange of statistical
data and other statistical information.

An important part of EDRC’s contribution to the Bank
is the economic evaluation of loan and technical assistance
activities. EDRC continued to fulfill this role by participating
in the processing of new loans and technical assistance
projects and in the evaluation of projects completed, It made
significant efforts during the year to streamline project and
technical assistance documentation for which it provides
editorial services.

Asa major part of its development resource center role,
EDRC maintained an active program of conferences and
seminars. It organized the 1992 Development Round Table
on foreign investment in the Asian and Pacific region, the
broader Round Table on Development Strategies, and Asian
Economic Outlook Workshop that examined economic
issues and trends for the region. A Conference on
Development Economics, also envisaged as an annual event,
was held as a forum for the discussion of cutting-edge
research and thinking. A seminar on geographic information
system and remote sensing for development was co-hosted
with ESCAP.

{A series of economic seminars were organized as a
Bankwide forum for the discussion of economic
development issues. Topics addressed during the year
included social and economic justification of education
projects; tax reform; the recent economic performance of
Asian countries in the face of world recession, global
economic prospects; the North American free trade
agreement; the future of East Asia; the World Bank
approach to industrial strategy; and trade policy review and
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

Through its technical assistance, EDRC also
maintained active involvement in human resource
development for the region. Its Special Secondment Scheme
continued to offer mid-level DMC officials the opportunity
to work at the Bank to gain on-the-job experience, while its
association with the Asian Productivity Organization offered
sponsorships for several training activities. During 1992,
training seminars for DMC officials were held on monetary
and fiscal policy, international finance, and tax policy and
reforms.

Aid Coordination

The Bank attaches considerable importance to the
question of aid coordination among various agencies to
maximize the use of scarce development resources. It
participates in various country and sector-specific meetings
of aid groups and has come to be recognized as a major
partner of economic development in several DMCs. The
Fourteenth ADB-World Bank Coordination Meeting was
held in May in connection with the Bank's Twenty-Fifth
Annual Meeting in Hong Kong. The President attended the
meetings of the Development Committee and Heads of
Multilateral Financial Institutions in Washington, D.C. in
September.

in July, the Bank attended the first meeting of the
Consultative Group on Indonesia, chaired by the World
Bank, which pledged a total of $4.9 billion, slightly more
than the $4.75 billion pledged at the meeting of the previous
coordinating group.

The second meeting of the Mongolia Assistance Group
was held in Tokyo on 28-29 May. It was co-chaired by the
Government of Japan and the World Bank and attended by
delegates and observers from 16 countries and five
international organizations, including the Bank. The Bank
also participated in the 1992 Donor Consultation Meeting
held in Uiaanbaatar on 14-15 October.

Under the International Peace Agreement on
Cambodia, the Supreme National Council (SNC) of
Cambodia and the United Nations Txansitiona! Authority in
Cambodia (UNTAC) are responsible ior monitoring and
coordinating aid to Cambodia during the pre-election
transitional period. The United Nations Development

Programme (UNDP) also plays a major role in aid
coordination, with its significant in-country operational
capacity. UNTAC and UNDP established a Donor
Consultative Group (and a series of technical sub-groups) to
advise the Director on external assistance matters to be
considered by the SNC. The Bank convenes and chairs the
technical sub-group for the energy sector.

The Ministerial Conference on the Rehabilitation and
Reconstruction of Cambodia held in dune in Tokyo was the
first high-level international forum for aid coordination in
Cambodia. The conference, chaired by the Government of
Japan and co-chaired by UNDP, adopted two declarations
(the Tokyo declarations) on “The Rehabilitation and
Reconstruction of Cambodia" and “The Cambodian Peace
Process." The first provides, inter alia, for the establishment
of an International Committee for the Reconstruction of
Cambodia, a consultative body fo assist in the reconstruction
of the country in a coordinated manner.

Activities for the development of the Lower Mekong
River Basin are coordinated by the Mekong Cornmittee.

The Bank also participated in the 17th Consultative
Group Meeting for the Philippines, held in Hong Kong in
March; a meeting of the Bangladesh Aid Consortium, held
in Paris in April, which pledged total aid commitments of
about $2.1 billion for 1992/93; the Fourth Round Table
Meeting for Bhutan in March, which reviewed the
Government's Seventh Plan (1992-1996) and indicated an
aid level of between $500 million and $700 million; the
Fourth Round Table Meeting for Lao PDR in Geneva in
March, under the auspices of UNDP, which slated an
indicative assistance of $600 million for the period
1992-1994; the tenth meeting of the Nepal Aid Group in
April, which pledged about $445 million for the fiscal year
1992/93, as well as annual aid consortium meetings on
India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

SPRO continued to consult extensively with
representatives of IMF, World Bank, UNDP, ESCAP, the
European Comrnunity and other agencies. SPRO teams
visited the capitals of Australia and New Zealand for program
discussions in February and its Director participated in
high-level discussions with the Australian authorities in
October. SPRO also collaborated actively with regional
agencies. It was represented at the Partners Meeting organized by South Pacific Forum (SPF) in March, the SPF
Committee on Regional Economic Issues and Trade in April

and the South Pacific Commission Annual Meeting in
October. SPRO also worked with the South Pacific Regional
Environment Programme (SPREP}, the Forum Fisheries
Agencies and UNCTAD in areas of mutual interest.

Two areas of coordination stooc out. First, economic
analyses were made available to the donor community and
the SPDMCs to facilitate a better policy dialogue. Second,
subsianiial inpuis were provided through SPREP to develop
regiona! positions on environmentai matters.

Operational Strategy: The Bank's overall objective
in Bangladesh is the reduction of poverty. It seeks to achieve
this goal through a medium-term operational strategy which
both promotes a faster economic growth and enhances the
poor's capacity to benefit frorn it. Greater market orientation, expansion of domestic resource use, accelerated
human resource development and improved physical
infrastructure are the essential elements of this strategy.
Activities which enhance employment opportunities, health,
education, training, population planning, basic services and
credit facilities are emphasized. The improvernent and
protection of the environment, in particular the physical and
human consequences of poverty and natural resource
management, are also vital concerns. The Bank supports
activities that help improve agricultural efficiency and
productivity, strengthen the corporate sector through
privatization, develop the capital market and reform the
financial sector.

Policy Dialogue: The Bank has broadened its policy
dialogue with the Government in various sectors. In agriculture, it supports reforms to enhance the role of the private
sector by lideralizing and deregulating the supply of minor
irrigation equipmeni, fertilizers and seeds, improving
foodgrain managernent. and reorganizing and commercializing public entities. In industry, it seeks the restructuring
and privatization of public manufacturing enterprises, reduction of subsidies and price deregulation. Dialogue has been

initiated on the development of capital markets. In the
railways sector, the Bank is helping the Government
optimize the labor force through voluntary separation and
restructure railway operations to wipe out deficits in the
medium term. In the social sector, the financing,
restructuring and reorientation of higher secondary education have been the focus of Bank support, while increased
emphasis is given on primary education. health and basic
services, and population programs

Loans and Technical Assistance: Bank lending
during the year amounted to $257.5 million for six projects.
Three of the loans were for the agriculture sector, amounting
to $153.2 million: $39.8 million (and a $790,000 technical
assistance grant) for the Second Bhola Irtigation Project
combining water management, cyclone protection and rural
infrastructure; $30 million (and a $600,000 technical
assistance grant) for the Rural Poor Cooperative Project to
improve the incomes and productivity of marginal farmers
and the viability of farmers’ cooperatives; and $83.4 million

The social infrastructure sector received the other three
loans amounting to $104.3 million. The Bangladesh Open
University Project was provided a $34.3 million loan to help
provide direct access to education and training to rural
groups that are currently excluded from the educational
system, particularly women and other disadvantaged sections of society. A $15 million loan for the Rehabilitation of
Damaged School Facilities Project will help primary and
secondary schools in Chittagong and Khulna Divisions
destroyed during a cyclone in April 1991. A $55 million
loan was approved for the Secondary Towns Integrated
Flood Protection Project, designed to improve drainage and
environment sanitation, solid waste management and health
conditions in densely populated areas of six towns.

In all, 21 technical assistance grants were approved
during the year for a combined total of $9.1 million. Of this
amount, $6.3 million was for advisory and operational
purposes and $2.8 million for project preparation.

Project Implementation: Of the 105 loans approved
for Bangladesh as of end-1992, 58 had been closed and 47
were under administration. Five loans were awaiting effectivity and seven were closed during 1992. Contracts worth
$268 million were awarded during the year, bringing the
cumulative total to $2,387 million or 67 per cent of the net
effective loan amount. Disbursements totalled $326 million,
against $276 million in 1991, bringing cumulative disbursements to $2,300 million or 65 per cent of the total net
effective loan amount.

country project review mission was undertaken in October
to discuss and resolve issues affecting project performance,
and seminars were held on project implementation and the
use of consultancy services.

Bhutan

Operational Strategy: The operational strategy is to
help ease institutional and manpower constraints and
develop the country's capacity to earn foreign exchange.
The Government's efforts to balance social and economic
development are also supported. To avoid straining
Bhutan's administrative and debt-servicing capacity, the
Bank limits its loan assistance to relatively small amounts and
plays a catalytic role, using technical assistance, in preparing
development projects and mobilizing co-financing,
particularly grants.

Policy Dialogue: Discussions during the year centered
on ways to strengthen the country’s development agencies,
improve domestic resource mobilization, and enhance the
role of the private sector.

neighboring countries is stressed. Consequently, sectoral
investments will be considered in a wider regional context.
The Bank's strategy also calls for more attention to the
country’s social problems to fulfill immediate basic needs and
attain development in the long term. Projects in the social
infrastructure sector were selected with due consideration to
the Government's absorptive capacity and programs of
other aid agencies to ensure that they were appropriate and
relevant.

Three major operational areas have been outlined:
improving the policy and institutional environment;
diversifying and expanding the production/export base; and
addressing basic needs and human resource development.
In all these areas, the Bank seeks a. balance arnong project
lending, technical assistance and policy-based program lending. The Government's absorptive capacity is an important
consideration in planning the operational program.

Policy Dialogue: The Second Agriculture Program
Loan approved during the year provided the basis for the
adoption of policies for a competitive development of the
country’s agricultural economy. The Financial Sector Program Loan supported macroeconomic, policy and institutional reforms, including the restructuring of the monetary
and banking systems, interest and exchange rate policies,
mobilization of domestic resources and access to long-term
credit. In the power subsector, project-specific policy
dialogue touched on improving the operational and financial
efficiency of the power system through tariff adjustment and
better management. In the roads and social infrastructure
sectors, the discussions focused on cost-recovery measures,
improving the regulatory environment, institutional
strengthening and the economic viability of rural and provincial water supply systerns.COUNTRY HIGHLIGHTS Maleysia

preparation of bid documents for the Egiin Hydropower
Project. Twelve technical assistance grants totalling $6 million were also approved during the year, of which six were
project preparatory grants and ‘six were for advisory and
operational purposes.

Project Implementation: The Bank’s experience

Operational Strategy: In the near to medium term,
the Bank will focus on poverty reduction through broadbased, employment-generating growth. The sectors to
receive attention are agriculture, industry, tourism and physical infrastructure. To enable the poor to benefit from
growth, the strategy also calls for efforts in the social sectors
to raise their productivity and incomes. In addition, quality
will be emphasized in project selection and design and the
Bank will be involved to a greater degree in projeci
implementation.

Policy Dialogue: Discussions continued during the
year on the Government's policy agenda’ and sectoral
priorities, particularly those included in the Eighth Plan
{1992-1997}. Issues concerning public resource allocation
and management, administrative reforms and prospects for
greater private sector involvement in the development
process were addressed. In the energy sector, the focus of
the dialogue was on hydropower investments, particularly
the implication of stich investments on the Government’s
debi-servicing capacity, and on the operational efficiency
and financial viability of the Nepal Electricity Authority.

Loans and Technical Assistance: Three loans
totalling $43 million were approved in 1992. A
$10.4 million loan was made in the tourism sector to
improve tourism infrastructure in and around Pokhara and
Gorkha. The project was supported by two technical assistance grants totalling $735,000. A $20 million loan and a
$280,000 technical assistance grant were provided for the

Pakistan

Operational Strategy: The Bank seeks the development of a self-sustained, open:and outward-looking
economy through fiscal, financial sector and other policy
reforms. The emphasis is on improving economic efficiency,
strengthening domestic capital markets and privatizing
government entities. as well as providing for basic human
necessities, reducing poverty and developing human
resources.

Considering Pakistan’s climate, limited water resources
and scarce domestic financing, the Bank’s assistance to the
agriculture sector continues to focus on increasing crop
productivity through better water management, trigation
systems and farm-to-market roads. In the energy sector, the
major objective is to bridge the gap between demand and
supply, and to develop indigenous energy resources to
reduce costly petroleum imports. In industry, the Bank seeks
to create a suitable environment for private investment,
catalyzed where necessary by direct Bank financing or equity
participation. In the social sector, efforts are focused principally on education, health, water supply and sewerage, and
urban rehabilitation and development. Institutionai development in all sectors is the objective of advisory technical
assistance.

Policy Dialogue: Direct taxation of farming income,

sector. The Small Farmers Credit Project allowed discussions
with the Land Bank of the Philippines on strengthening rural
credit programs for smal! farmers and enhancing the role of
cooperatives as financial intermediaries in the rural financial
sector.

which will likely condition the next phase of Thailand’s
development, the Government's strategic priorities and
policies as reflected in the Seventh National Economic and

operational considerations. The strategy will emphasize the
development of physical infrastructure, environment and
natural resource management, human resource development and private sector development. The approach will be
twofold. First, the Bank will help develop a basis for longterm competitiveness to support a sustainable and more
balanced long-term economic growth. Second, it will help
achieve a more equitable development, with emphasis on
rural development and regional dispersal of economic
activity.

Policy Dialogue: The Bank’s policy dialogue in
Thailand emphasizes strengthening of the performance of
state enterprises as part of the wider effort for economic
restructuring. Through a combination of technical assistance
and loan covenants, the Bank has aimed at promoting
privatization, supporting energy conservation, improving
the planning, coordination and management of projects,
raising the managerial efficiency of state enterprises and
introducing corrective measures such as tariff increases, debt
restructuring, reduction in system losses and organizational
reforms.

Operational Strategy: The Bank's interim strategy,
designed as the framework for initial operations when
lending activities resume, seeks to rehabilitate and develop
the country’s physical infrastructure to underpin growth in
production, trade and investment. The strategy is designed
also to support further macro and sector-based policy and
institutional reforms to increase domestic resource
mobilization, improve the efficiency of the public sector, and
promote private enterprise. Hunan resource development,
training and technology transfer are also part of the agenda.

Policy Dialogue: Discussions on aspects of macroeconomic management and adjustments, and on policy
issues within the agriculture sector were initiated during the
year.

Loans and Technical Assistance: Several missions
visited Viet Nam during the year to update information on
the economic outlook and various sectors of the economy
in preparation for possible future loans and technical
assistance. Between 1968, when lending and technical
assistance operations in Viet Narn began, and 1978, when
operations were temporarily suspended, the Bank had
financed nine projects through 11 loans totalling
$44.6 million, and provided 12 technical assistance grants
amounting to $1.1 milion.

strengthening of key Government agencies will remain the
objective of technical assistance, with emphasis on the
development of planning and implementation capabilities,
and analyses of sectoral policy issues.

Policy Dialogue: The role of Bank assistance was
generally discussed in the light of the Government's policy
to reduce its reliance on foreign borrowings for public sector
undertakings, partly due to high domestic liquidity and
bilateral grant assistance. Technical assistance will be
increasingly emphasized to help the Government formulate
suitable investment projects and undertake sector policy
analyses consistent with the current macroeconomic
framework.

Loans and Technical Assistance: One $18 million
loan was approved in 1992 for the Second Road Upgrading
Project to improve selected roads and raise the efficiency of
the road network. Three technical assistance grants were
also approved, of which two were associated with the
Second Road Upgrading Project: a $400,000 grant to
prepare a national transport sector plan and a $150,000
grant to help develop a road safety and traffic management
program. The third grant was for $130,000 to prepare
operational strategies and draw up a corporate plan for Fiji
Development Bank.

Project Implementation: Of the 12 loans approved
as of end-1992, nine had been closed and three were under
administration. Of the nine closed loans, five required
extension of loan closing dates because of implementation
delays. Contract awards in 1992’ totalled $0.96 million,
bringing the cumulative amount to $87 million, or

Marshall Islands, Republic of the

Operational Strategy: The Bank has a tentative
operational strategy formulated in July 1990, shortly after
the Marshall Islands became a Bank member. The strategy
supports the main socioeconomic objectives of the
Government's second Five-Year Development Plan (19921996): making the economy more self-reliant by developing
marine resources; upgrading human resources through
education, manpower training and family planning;
encouraging private entrepreneurship; and strengthening
institutions to improve efficiency in the public sector. The
Bank will also suppori infrastructure development to
enhance the productive capacity. ;

Policy Dialogue: Policy discussions stressed the need
for adequate internal deliberation before the Government
issued new bonds against future payments under the
Compact of Free Association with the United States. They
also highlighted the need to trim the civil service and the
urgency to improve cost recovery on utilities and other public
services. Technical assistance will be the basis for future
discussions and policy reforms.

Loans and Technical Assistance: There was no new
foan during the year but five technical assistance grants
amounting to $2.1 million were approved. These included
a $1.1 million grant provided to help strengthen the Office
of Planning and Statistics. The technical assistance project
emphasizes on-the-job training and includes a scholarship

component to train Marshallese in tertiary institutions

abroad. When completed, a core group of Marshallese will
be able to take over administration of the office from
expatriate staff.

Project Implementation: The Fisheries Development Project loan of $7 million, approved in September
1991 and declared effective on 14 April 1992, remained
the sole Bank loan to Marshall Islands as of end-1992. This
is a private sector venture based in Kwajalein Atoll.

Microne: Federated States of

  

Operational Strategy: The Bank's first operational
strategy for Micronesia since it became a Bank member in
April 1990 was prepared in the last quarter of 1992. It will
seek to help the country realize its long-term objectives as
set out in the Second National Development Plan (1992
1996}, including enhancing the domestic productive
capacity through private sector involvement in fisheries,
tourism and agriculture. It also takes note of the need to
make the economy more self-reliant in the face of declining
resources under the Compact of Free Association with the
United States. Human resource development through
education, manpower training and family planning, and
institution and capacity building to improve public sector
efficiency are the other objectives of the strategy.

Policy Dialogue: Policy discussions centered on the
need for debt management under a program of borrowing
against future payments under the Compact of Free
Association with the United States; improving sectorspecific investment decisions, especially in fisheries and
agriculture; civil service reform; adequate maintenance
expenditure; cost recovery in public utilities; and fostering a
more conducive investment climate.

Loans and Technical Assistance: No new loan was
approved in 1992. Two technical assistance grants were
approved. One was of $408,000 to improve the financial
resource management capabilities of the national and the
four state governments. The project will help improve the
monitoring and management of aid flows more effectively
and set up a procedure for consolidating budgetary operations. The other grant was of $350,000 for power sector
development.

Papua New Guinea

Operational Strategy: A revision of the operational
strategy was under preparation during the year. The revised
strategy will support the new Government’s policy of greater
assistance to the rural sector, where the bulk of the
population lives, to improve services and employment
opportunities, In line with the lead agency role assigned to
the Bank in several sectors, the strategy will also stress the
need to improve sector-specific policy environments. Bank
assistance in these sectors will help improve the productive
capacity and employment opportunities. Given the
country’s acute shortage of skilled manpower and the
relatively high population growth rate, the strategy
emphasizes human resource development through
education, better health services and family planning.

Policy Dialogue: Policy discussions centered on the
need to improve the private investment climate in the key
sectors of agriculture and fisheries. The Bank continued to
support structural adjustment reforms to improve international competitiveness, reduce the budget deficit, increase
allocations for operation and maintenance and safeguard the
environment. In view of the expected boom in the minerals
and oil sector, the Bank also discussed with central planningCOUNTRY HIGHLIGHTS Papua New Guinea

and the total number of PCRs prepared as of end-1992
came to 511.

The Bank completed Country Project Implementation
Profiles (CPIPs) for India, Mongolia and Sri Lanka, and
commenced preliminary work in Viet Nam. These profiles
serve as reference documents containing comprehensive
information on policies, rules and regulations of governments and major autonomous agencies concemed with
project implementation. A review of the benefits of
completed profiles is currently being undertaken before
proceeding with further CPIPs.

Contract Awards

During 1992, contracts totalling $2,665 million
($1,694 million OCR and $972 million from ADF}, were
awarded by executing agencies for consultancy services,
procurement of goods, related services and civil works. This
represented a 9 per cent decrease from 1991. Cumulative
contract awards amounted to $23,175 million.

Consultancy contracts, although being a small proportion of total contract awards, play a vital role in project
implementation. During 1992, consultancy contracts under
loan projects totalled $62.2 million and involved 165
consulting firns and 21 individual consultants, The cumulative value of contract awards for consultancy services under
loan projects reached $1,247 million.

For technical assistance projects, the Bank awarded
366 contracts for consultancy services amounting to
$79.5 million and involving 284 consulting firms and 265
individual consultants. The cumulative value of contract
awards for consultants under technical assistance projects
amounted to $440.2 million.

Loan Disbursements

Loan disbursements decreased 11 per cent to
$2,767 million in 1992. Of this, OCR disbursements
amounted to $1,880 million and ADF disbursements

respectively, from 1991. The comparative details of
disbursements in 1991 and 1992 by lending modality are
provided in the accompanying table.

The decline in disbursements was due to the fact that
extraordinary disbursements totalling $160'million to India
and Mongolia under special assistance projects and
$137 million to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka
under Gulf crisis assistance and cyclone damage rehabilitation projects, had been made in 1991. This had inflated that
year's figures. Disbursements in 1992 were also affected by
slower progress in project implementation, including the
deferment of expected program loan disbursemenis to the
extent of $247 million.

Private Sector Investment Portfolio

At the end of 1992, the Bank held 84 investments in
80 companies amounting to $369 million. Disbursements
were in progress for 18 investments, which amounted to
$115 million, net of loan recoveries, or 31 per cent of the
portfolio. Disbursements had been completed for 66 investments, making up $254 million or 69 per cent of the
portfolio.

Of the 80 companies, 48, with investments amounting
to $229 million or 62 per cent of the portfolio, had reached
full-scale ‘operational status. Of the remaining 32 companies, 18 with investments totalling $119 million, or 32
per cent of the portfolio, were in their initial stages of
operations, while 14 with investments amounting to $21
million, or 6 per cent of the portfolio, were experiencing
operational problems,

Dividends received during 1992 amounted to
$1.3 million compared to $3 million in 1991. Interest and
fee income amounted to $19.8 million against
$16.7 million a year ago. Capital gains during the year,
through the sale of shares and stock rights, amounted to
$2.3 million. The Bank made a general provision of
$440,000 in 1992 against possible losses. Total provision
at year-end stood at $3 million, which was less than
1 per cent of the portfolio held.

Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation

Benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) consists of
preparing and analyzing benchmark information about
beneficiaries, monitoring project benefits and preparing
studies to evaluate the benefits of completed projects. The
Bank's approach to BME has evolved and continues to do
so in response to changes in the Bank’s operations. During
the year, initial steps were taken to coordinate and
rationalize arrangements and work procedures for preparing
benchmark information to coincide with the conduct ofLOAN DISBURSEMENTS, 1991 AND 1992

Arrangements were introduced to enable Projects
Departments to more closely monitor the conduct of benefit
evaluation studies of completed projects through the
issuance of a status report updated twice a year. According
to the report, two projects were evaluated during the year
with support from the Bank.

To facilitate the implementation of these activities, the

Eight advisory technical assistance projects were
approved in 1992 to assist agencies in DMCs to develop
institutional capabilities for conducting BME activities. One
of them was to assist government agencies in Sri Lanka in
evaluating the impact of a completed program loan and one
was a regional project to develop a framework for assessing
the impact of program loans. Of the rest, four were to assist
in establishing and upgrading national-level information
systems to monitor key development indicators in the health
and education sectors.important milestone in 1992, completing two

decades of operation since the exercise began in
1972. More mature and diversified in scope, the program
is run by the Post-Evaluation Office (PEO), which reports
directly to the President, and is guided by the same clear
objective: How to improve the design, implernentation and
performance of development projects and enable the Bank
to better account for the effectiveness of its assistance.

The primary component of the program is Project
Performance Audit Reports (PPARs), which are prepared
after the Project Completion Reports (PCRs). The program
also covers various other studies of broader relevance to the
Bank’s operations, such as special studies, impact evaluation
studies and re-evaluation studies. Special studies involve

‘ intensive analyses of particular issues or comprehensive
reviews of post-evaluation findings in a specific country or
sector. Impact evaluation studies attempt to assess the
long-term impact of Bank assistance to a particular sector,
while re-evaluation studies look at projects about five years
atter the PPAR stage to re-assess their performance and
sustainability.

Until 1987, the Bank followed the policy of postevaluating all completed projects for which PCRs had been
prepared. However, considering the rapid increase in the
number of completed projects, which reached over 50 in
1987, and the need for undertaking other post-evaluation
activities, a selective approach was introduced in 1988 for
the preparation of PPARs.

To ensure that the effectiveness of the evaluation
system is not jeopardized, PEO has maintained the coverage
of PPARs to at least about 50 per cent. The criteria used in
selecting completed projects and programs for PPARs are
periodically reviewed and adjusted to maintain their
suitability and relevance.

The current selection criteria, which were adopted in
1992, cail for post-evaluation of all program and sector
loans and all first loans to a country or @ subsector, while
other projects are selected across the sectors and countries
largely on a randors basis.

The adoption of this selective method helped release
PEO’s iimited resources to initiete two new activities,
namely. post-evaluation of technica: assistance operations
and strengthening the post-evajuation capability of DMCs.

Te BANK’S post-evaluation program reached an

Project Performance Audit Reports

Despite the expansion of the scope of work, PPARs
continue io be the core activity of PEO. During the year, 28
PPARs were prepared covering two program loans and 26
projects, including the first post-evaluation of a Bankfinanced private sector project without government
guarantee, The projects were in 12 subsectors and 11
DMCs. Sectorally, 13 projects were in agriculture/agroindustry, five each in social infrastructure and
industry/non-fuel minerals, four in energy, and one in
transport and communications. By country, 15 projects
were in seven Group A countries, 12 in three Group B
countries and only one in a Group C country. By the end of
the year, 380 PPARs had been prepared for 399 projects
covering all major sectors and subsectors in 24 DMCs.

A majority of the projects post-evaluated in 1992 had
been approved and completed in the 1980s. The total costs
for these projects, including financing from all sources were
originally estimated at $1,635 million. However, at the time
of project completion, actual costs proved to be
$1,373 million, 16 per cent lower than the original
estimate. The underrun resulted from a combination of
factors, such as reduction in the project scope,
overestimation of costs and movements of exchange rates.
A proportionate underrun was experienced in the case of
Bank financing, too, with only $781 million needing to be
disbursed out of $926 million originally approved.

Post-evaluated projects are classified as generally
successful, partly successful or unsuccessful according to
criteria developed by PEO. By and large, the projects are
rated in terms of their economic viability as reflected in
economic internal rates of retum and/or the extent to which
the project objectives achieved are cornmensurate with costs
incurred. Of the projects evaluated in 1992, 11 (39 per cent)
were considered generally successful, 12 (43 per cent) parily
successful and five (18 per cent) unsuccessful.

Although a relatively iarge nusnber of the projects
post-evaluated in 1992 were selected on a random basis,
they were not necessarily representative of all Bank-financed
projects completed during the year. Also, the comparison
of project performance in different years based on results of
post-evaluated projects is not meaningful. Instead. a iarger

several years may constitute a more representative sample
of completed projects for the purpose of judging project
performance. The success rate of all projects post-evaluated
so far is about 60 per cent. There has been a decline in the
long-run average success rate since 1988 due, to a large
extent, to projects becoming increasingly more complex and
a greater number of the projects being in Group A and
Group B countries, where institutional constraints and lack
of resilience to deai with external factors had adversely
affected project performance.

The results of post-evaluated projects in a given year
are influenced by project-specific factors as well as the sector
and country mix of projects evaluated. Suitability and
flexibility of project design, experienced staff and
operational sustainability are the key to satisfactory performance. Performance is affected by deficiencies in project
design, inadequate involvement of beneficiaries, institutional
and administrative constraints in the borrowing DMCs and
inadequacies in the policy environment. In the 1992
exercise, external factors, such as adverse changes in cornmodity prices and unfavorable weather conditions, were also
found to account for less than satisfactory results in a
relatively large number of projects. Many of the projects
were undermined by insufficient cost recovery. The two
program loans post-evaluated fell short of the desired resulis
because of design problems and unsatisfactory compliance
with major loan covenants.

The results for 1992 indicated that a number of projects
performed well, including the first postevaluated private
sector project, three electric power projects, two irrigation
projecis, one forestry project, three mineral resources
projects and an education project. The private sector project
paved the way for modernizing the recipient country’s
spinning sector and helped save scarce foreign exchange
through import substitution. The three power distribution
projects contributed to a more reliable supply of power to
meet increasing demand in the urban and rural areas of the
recipient countries. The two irrigation projects generated
substantial benefits in terms of increased agricultural
production and farm incomes in less developed areas. A
large number of poor farmers benefited from growing trees
under the forestry project. The equipment, facilities and
technical support provided under all three mineral resource
projects helped the recipient countries undertake scientific
surveys for productive exploitation of minérals. The education project helped upgrade the quality of tertiary education
and improve the regional distribution of educational opportunities in the borrowing country. In a number of projects,
including the less successful ones, assistance provided by the
Bank was seen to have contributed substantially to
institutional strengthening in the recipient DMCs.

A few important lessons have emerged from the 1992
post-evaluation exercise. First, there is a need to improve
project quality through a more effective use of project
preparatory technical assistance. Second, judging from thePOST-EVALUATION

intense competition for alternative uses of water, as
evidenced by the experience of water supply and irrigation
projects post-evaluated, there is aneed to have an integrated
approach in planning and evaluating such projects. Third,
the Bank needs to further improve the formulation and
design of program loans and to ensure that institutional
capabilities in the DMCs in relation fo such loans are
adequate.

Crosscutting Issues

Since most of the projects evaluated had been approved
in the 1980s, they did not explicitly relate to crosscutting
issues, such as poverty reduction, women in development,
improvement of human ‘resources and environmental
protection. Nevertheless, some of the projects addressed
these issues implicitly or as a matter of some concern.
Accordingly, and where relevant, the PPARs attempted to
assess the impact of the projects on the poor, the women
and the environment. The irrigation and forestry projects
were found to have had a significant impact on small
farmers, boosting their incomes and standards of living.
Projects aimed at providing electric power, water, roads,
primary health care and education also improved the living
conditions of the rural population. A number of PPARs
reported that women accounted for a significant proportion
of the beneficiaries. The findings on the irrigation and water
supply projects indicated the need for a more efficient water
resource management to prevent the degradation of the
ecosystem and depletion of water resources.

Post-Evaluation Studies

In addition to the PPARs, PEO completed one impact
evaluation study and three re-evaluation studies during the
year. The impact study was an attempt to evaluate the
long-term socioeconomic and institutional effects of three
Bank-assisted water supply projects in an urban
metropolitan center. The re-evaluation studies involved an
irrigation project, an education project and a fertilizer project
which had been post-evaluated earlier.

The impact evaluation study found that the capacity of
the executing agency, a government-owned utility, to
produce and manage water supplies had improved markedly
as a result of the Bank-financed projects. The projects made

- water accessible to an increasing number of users, a majority
of whom were in the low income group. However, it was
found thai the overuse of groundwater by private consumers
and industry nad led to severe ground subsidence, damaging
buildings and infrastructure and increasing the incidence and
severity of flooding in the metropolitan area. Efforts to
substitute grouncwater by project-suppiiec surface water
were less than optimal. The study indicated that design andANNUAL REPORT 1992
7 a

 

 

appraisal of water supply projects needed to take into
account the economic cost of groundwater use and that
prices charged for water should fully reflect the economic
costs of supplying it and possible environmental costs.

As regards re-evaluation, the study of the irrigation
project noted that it had not reached its full potential yet
after six years of operation. About 30 per cent of the
irrigable area had yet to receive irrigation because the supply
was limited and there were not enough iertlary canals.
Although cropping and production intensities in the irrigated
areas were high, the benefits could be threatened by the
increasing demand for water and land from urbanization and
industrialization. Because of the smaller-than-expected
irrigated area, lower output prices and the higher system
O&M costs, the project's economic viability had been
adversely affected, and the project had to be reclassified from
“generally successful" to "partly successful." The study highlighted the need for switching from rice to higher-value crops
and for improving water use efficiency.

The engineering education project was reconfirmed as
partly successful on re-evaluation because its performance
had not improved since post-evaluation five years ago.
Although laboratory and workshop equipment had been
upgraded and opportunities for engineering education had
been expanded, the facilities remained largely unutilized and
the quality of engineering education had not improved as

.expected. The rate of graduates from the engineering

schools under the project passing the national board
examination had declined over the years. Most of the faculty
members trained overseas under the project had either left
fo join the private sector or stayed abroad. There was an
over-supply of engineering graduates, but a significant
proportion of these graduates were employed as technicians
or in jobs that required no professional engineering qualificaHons.

The project experience demonstrated that engineering
education projects needed to be based on detailed demandsupply analyses as well as the absorptive capacity of user
industries.

The re-evaluation of the fertilizer project led to its
upgrading from a rating of “partly successful" in the PPAR
to “generally successful." The PPAR, prepared in 1981, had
suggested a program to rectify the design deficiencies of the
nitrogen/phosphate (NP} plant concerned to increase its
production capacity, without which, it was believed, the
project’s viability would be questionable. A re-visit to the
project revealed a significant increase in fertilizer production,
achieved through the rectification of design flaws and
rehabilitation of other plant facilities. The additional costs
incurred in the process were well compensated by increased
benefits,

The study highlighted the need for the Government to
involve the private sector more actively in production and
distribution of fertilizers by removing price controls and
improving the investment climate.

Operations

Post-evaluation of the Bank's technical assistance
operations was continued in 1992, when four Technical
Assistance Performance Audit Reports (TPARs} were

repared: two involving project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) and one each for advisory technical assistance
(ADTA) and regional technical assistance (RETA). Three of
these projects were found to have achieved their purposes
satisfactorily: an ADTA for a pilot program for contract
maintenance of national roads, a PPTA for an irrigation
project; and a RETA for a seminar on technical and vocational education. The fourth project, a PPTA for technology
assessment, development and management, was compleied
with partly successful results. These TPARs confirmed the
need for carefulness in preparing the terms of reference for
consultants and recruiting consultants with good knowledge
of local conditions. It should be noted that these TPARs were
prepared before a systematic approach was introduced for
the preparation of technical assistance completion reports
(TCRs}. With the requirement of preparing TCRs for all
stand-alone TA projects approved on or after
1 danuary 1992, it is expected that the preparation of
TPARs will be greatly facilitated.

Feedback of Post-Evaluation Findings

The usefulness of post-evaluation depends on how
effectively the lessons learned are fed back into the
operational system of the Bank. During 1992, PEO’s compuierized Post-Evaluation Information System (PEIS), which
provides updated findings and statistical analyses of data,
continued to be accessible on-line to the Bank's operational
departments. This was supplemented by the Eleventh

- Synopsis of Post-Evaluation Reports in March and the
Fourteenth Annual Review of Post-Evaluation Reports in
April :

The Management Committee on Post-Evaluation
Findings (MCPF), established in 1991 under the
chairmanship of the President, held its bi-annual meetings
in February and September to discuss issues arising from
post-evaluation studies that warranted specific attention
from and guidance by Management. The meetings
strengthened the feedback process and follow-up actions. In
addition, PEO continued to be associated with the
processing of loan and technical assistance projects by

reviewing and commenting on draft Board documents as
well as by participating in loan processing meetings. Besides,
country strategy studies, operational programs and project
appraisal took account of the Bank’s experience with postevaluated projects. 
PEO also initiated during the year an internal review of
its current feedback system with a view to improving the
dissemination of post-evaluation findings on a timely basis
and ina more useful manner. In collaboration with the Office
of the Computer Services, PEO is planning to make the

The Bank has played a leading role in helping the DMCs
develop and strengthen their own evaluation capabilities.
A major activity undertaken by PEO during the year was
organizing a Regional Seminar on Performance Evaluation
in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in May. The seminar. the first
of its kind in the Asian and Pacific region, was co-sponsored
by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD). it was attended by 38 senior representatives from
147 DMCs and members of DAC’s Expert Group on Aid
Evaluation, including 43 representatives from 17 donor
countries and six multilateral institutions. Aimed at
increasing the awareness in DMCs of the importance of
performance evaluation as a management and planning
tool, the seminar adopted an action plan for strengthening
performance evaluation in Asia and the Pacific.

Two ADTAs were approved during the year for
strengthening post-evaluation capabilities in Philippines and
Thailand. Similar technical assistance had been provided to
Papua New Guinea in 1990 and Sri Lanka in 1991. These
ADTAs seek to enhance post-evaluation methodology, techniques and procedures; train government officials; make
available microcomputers, ancillary equipment and
software; and develop a computerized information system
for storing and recalling post-evaluation findings.

A Technical Assistance Completion Report (TCR) was
prepared by PEO as a self-evaluation of the ADTA to
Papua New Guinea for strengthening of the post-evaluation
capability of the Department of Finance and Planning. It was
noted that the ADTA had helped broaden the experience of
a core group of PNG officials with respect to problems and
issues of development projects and offered lessons for
developing a simple model for post-evaluation activities.PE Ee ETN EI OED MENS

exposure, changes in the Bank’s currency
management practices for OCR borrowers were approved
by the Board in June. For new loans approved since
J July 1992, OCR borrowers have the choice of either
(i) traditional Bank loans, i.e., variable-interest-rate multi
currency loans which are included in the Exchange Risk
Pooling System (ERPS) and are mainly in low-coupon
currencies, or (ii) loans in US dollars from the new US dollar
variable-interest-rate loan facility. In addition, the Board
approved changes to the Bank's currency disbursement and
recall practices with respect to all outstanding OCR fixedrate loans to give borrowers more complete information on
the currencies they will repay to the Bank on each due date.
The new practices will allow borrowers to better manage the
servicing of their loans.

Oa Management Practices: To improve

Review of Financial Policies: During 1992,
Management prepared for subsequent Board consideration
a review of the Bank’s financial policies. The review was
undertaken in order to (i) update and revise them in response
to the developments and experience gained since the

~ previous review undertaken in 1987, and (ii) establish

financial policy directions and assess the paid-in capital
requirements for the fourth general capital increase (GCIIN).
Also in 1992, an interdepartmental working group was
established to review the country risks of the Bank’s loan
portfolio and portfolio concentration, and to make
recommendations. The Bank also examined the need to
adopt an explicit policy on how and when it should impose
sanctions on a borrower in the unlikely event of loans to that
borrower becoming delinquent. Additionally, the Bank
considered a policy framework for its private sector
operations which would minimize the impact of such
operations on the overall OCR portiolio risk.

The review also included an examination of the Bank’s
liquidity policy. In particular, it considered alternative
approaches for determining the Bank's liquidity
requirements: whether the Bank should adopi a cash flow
approach or continue with the present and more practical
approach which uses the year-end undisbursed balance of

Bank’s income management policies and the major financial
indicaiors, including the interest coverage ratio (ICR) and the
reserve:loan ratio (RLR). Finally, the Board considered ©
the role of paid-in capital and gave preliminary
consideration to the Bank's paid-in capital requirements for

Use of OCR Income for Technical Assistance
Grants: During negotiations on the fifth Asian
Development Fund replenishment (ADF V1), donors
proposed that the use of OCR income for technical
assistance grants should be expanded beyond the customary
allocation equivalent to 2 per cent of OCR net income. In
August 1992, the Board of Directors recommended to the
Board of Govemors, through a draft Report and draft
Resolution, that an amount of $50 million, previously held
as surplus after allocation of OCR net income for 1991, be
reallocated to the Technical Assistance Special Fund (T. ASF).
The Resolution (Resolution No, 217) was adopted by the
Board of Governors on 28 September 1992. The Board of
Directors also agreed during 1992 that amounts of OCR net
income may be transferred to TASF in future years. The
amount to be transferred each year is to be decided by the
Board on the basis of a review of the net income outlook.
In addition, the Board amended the Regulations of TASF to
allow net income from OCR to be received and utilized by
TASF.

Proposed Fourth General
Capital Increase (GCI IV)

In May 1986, the Board of Governors adopted
Resolution No. 179 requesting the Board of Directors to
undertake a study of the Bank’s future resource
requirements for financing its ordinary operations. The
study is intended to result in the formulation of- specific
proposals for a further general capital increase (GCI IV).

study wes approved by the Board of Direciors in

report was considered by the Board of Governors at the

Work on the study of the Bank’s future resource
requirements continued in 1992. The Board considered
working papers on (i) the Bank’s projected OCR
operations during the period 1993-1997, {ii) resource
implications of the Bank’s future lending program,
(iii) the operational agenda for the GCI IV period
{1994-1998}, and {iv} modalities of the next general capital
increase.

Financial Ratios

The ICR, which is the ratio of net income (before
deducting interest on borrowings) to interest on borrowings,
measures the Bank's ability to meet its debt obligations out
of earnings. As of 31 December 1992, the ICR stood at
1.77 compared with 1.87 at the end of 1991. The RLR,
which is the ratio of reserves to disbursed and outstanding
loans, measures the Bank's ability to protect itself against
capital impairment due to possible loan losses. At the end
of 1992, the RLR was 36.9 per cent, compared to
37.6 per cent at the end of 1991.

Lending Rate

As noted above (see "Curren¢dy Management
Practices"), since 1 July 1992, the Bank has been offering
its OCR borrowers a choice’ of either US dollar loans or
traditional multi-currency loans which are included in the
Exchange Risk Pooling System. The lending rate on both
facilities is adjusted on 1 January and 1 duly each year. The
lending rate on multi-currency loans applies to all ordinary
operations loans approved after 30 June 1986 and to nearly
all ordinary operations loans approved between
24 September 1985 and 30 June 1986, and is determined
by adding a spread (currently 0.4 per cent per annum) to the
average cost of a pool of the Bank’s outstanding qualified
borrowings. The spread is intended to ensure that the Bank’s
loan charges {the spread plus a commitment fee) are
sufficient to cover administrative expenses and any cost of
carrying liquidity. From an initial level of 7.65 per cent per
annum, set on 1 July 1986, the lending rate on multicurrency loans progressively declined unti) 1 January 1990
when it reached its lowest level of 6.33 per cent per annum.
Following increases on 1 July 1990, 1 January 1991 and
1 July 1991 (when it reached 6.61 per cent per annum),
the rate was reduced on 1 January 1992 to 6.58 per cent
per annum, and was further reduced on 1 duly 1992 to
6.51 per cent per annum. In December 1992, the Bank
announced that the lending rate to apply from
1 January 1993 to 30 June 1993 on multi-currency loans

106

would be 6.47 per cent per annum. The lending rate on US
dollar loans is set at a variable spread (currently 0.4 per cent
per annum) over the average cost of borrowings undertaken
fo fund the US dollar pool. The rate for the first half of 1993
is 6.63 per cent per annum. .

Under the lending rate system which applied before the
variable tending rate system was introduced, rates were fixed
at the time of loan approval for the entire life of the loan.
As of 31 December 1992, the variable lending rate applied
to $6,129 million of disbursed and outstanding loans and to
$8,664 million of undisbursed loans, representing about
51 per cent and 96.7 per cent of the respective totals.

Currency Composition of Loans

At the end of 1992, outstanding loans were
disbursed mainly in four major currencies, namely, yen
(61 per cent), deutsche mark-(6.1 per cent), Swiss francs
(18.3 per cent) and US dollars (12.7 per cent). The increase
in the percentage of US dollars disbursed, from
10.8 per cent at the end of 1991, was due largely to the
formation of the new US dollar lending facility, which was
made available to OCR borrowers receiving loans approved
after 1 July 1992,

Status of Loans

At the end of 1992, one public sector loan was in 
arrears, and two private sector loans were placed under the
non-accrual status. Only about 17.3 per cent of effective
loans at the end of the year were due to mature within the
next five years.

Borrowings

In January 1992, the Board considered an indicative
borrowing program for 1992 of $2,600 million. In addition,
the 1992 liability management program included the
possible prepayment and refinancing of three callable yen
bond issues with an aggregate outstanding amount of
¥64 billion. The indicative borrowing program was
subsequently adjusted downward to $2,553 million to keep
the projected 1992 year-end liquidity ratio within the
operationally targeted range of 40 to 45 per cent. During
the year, the Bank undertook ten borrowings — nine, totalling
$2,556.3 million, fo raise new money and one, amounting
to $493.4 million equivalent, to finance the prepayment of
the three outstanding callable yen bond issues.

The Bank continued to borrow from a variety of
sources. During the year, it undertook four benchmark
issues: a ¥50 billion issue in the Eurobond market in January,
a ¥64 billion Samurai bond issue in May, a $500 millionORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Dutch guilder market in June - with a public bond issue of
£300 million — after being absent from that market since
1986. Public bond issues were launched in the Swiss capital
market in April (GwF300 million) and the US dollar domestic
capital market in September ($300 million). The proceeds
of the Eurodollar, Hong Kong dollar, Dutch guilder and
Yankee borrowings were all swapped into yen. A ¥50 billion
Daimyo bond issue was launched in January. In Sepiember,
the Bank contracted a two-tranche ¥30 billion direct borrowing with Japanese banks and insurance companies. In
October, a second “Dragon” bond issue (Asian region US
dollar public bond issue) was made for $300 million. Under

its Euro-commercial paper program during the year, the,

Bank issued three tranches totalling $500 million. The
proceeds of the three tranches were swapped into yen to
bridge-finance temporary deficiencies for disbursement
purposes.

As part of the liability management program for 1992,
three callabie yen bond issues with an aggregate outsianding
amount of ¥64 billion were prepaid. Early in 1992 the Bank
also prepaid the outstanding balances, amounting in total to
SwF74.1 million, of two Swiss franc bond issues with @
CCCC borrowing ‘imization covenant.

The average life (weighted oy amount) of the
borrowings undertaken in 1992 (excluding refinancing} wes

9.73 years. compared to 9.39 years in 1991. The average
cost {after swaps) of funds raised in 1992 (excluding
refinancing) declined to 5.86 per cent per annum from
6.80 per cent per annum in 1991. Out of the
$2,556 million of new funds raised in 1992, $2,256 million
was used to fund the ERPS variable lending rate facility. The
average cost (after swaps} of the funds raised for this facility
in 1992 was 5.81 per cent per annum.

The Bank’s: $300 million Dragon bond issue was the
first borrowing for its newly-established US dollar-specific
lending facility. The cost of this issue was 6.23 per cent per
annum. Accordingly, the variable lending rate for the new
facility during the first half of 1993 was set at 6.63 per cent
per annum.

Liquid Asset Investments

The Bank’s liquid assets consist of investment holdings
(excluding special reserve investments) and unrestricted
cash. The Bank continued to follow a policy of maintaining
year-end holdings of liquid assets at no less than 40 per cent
of undisbursed balances of both effective and not yet
effective loans. At the end of 1992, liquid assets totalled
$5,092 million (equivalent to about 44.6 per cent of
undisbursed loan balances) compared with $4,163 million
ai the end of 1991 (equivalent to about 43 per cent of the
undisbursed loan balances). The Bank's primary objective in
holding liquidity at this level is to ensure the uninterrupted
availability of funds for its operations and to ensure flexibility
in its borrowing decisions, especially when borrowings are
ternporarily affected by adverse conditions in the capital
markets.

The Bank's investment portfolio is actively managed,
the primary objectives being to ensure the security and
liquidity of funds invested and, subject to these considerations. to obtain maximum income on these assets. At the
end of 1992, OCR investments were denominated in 22
currencies (21 currencies at the end of 1991) and amounted
to the equivalent of $5,234 million ($4,331 million at the
end of 1991). Of the iotal investments, 81 per cent
(69 per cent at the end of 1991) was held in securities issued
or guaranteed by member governments and obligations of
other multilateral development banks and certain
governmenial entities. The remainder was invested in
deposits and other bank instruments in member countries.
The realized rate of return on OCR investments over the
year was 7.8 per cen:, comparec with 9.1 per cent in 1991.

Under the new Investment Authority approved by the
Board in October 1991, the Bank is permitted, among other
things, to execute transactions in financial futures and
options. enter into “short” securities positions and engage
jn. covered forward investments. Impiemeniation of the new
Investment Authority commenced in 1992. the primary
focus being on financial futures. Specifically, operational

guidelines were established, legal agreernents negotiated,
and risk controls implemented. In addition, the Bank’s
systerns infrastructure relating to its investment activities was
re-examined in order to enhance the efficiency of the Bank’s
investment operations. An objective of the re-examination
is to facilitate implementation of the new Investment
Authority.

Capitalization

in September 1988, the Board of Governors adopted
Resolutions No. 193, 194 and 195 authorizing special
increases in the capital subscriptions of Japan, Sweden and
United States, to take effect in accordance with the
provisions of those Resolutions. The Governors also
adopted Resolution No. 192 authorizing an increase of
62,194 shares in the Bank’s capital stock to be made
available for these special increases. The Resolutions
provided thai the subscriptions would become effective in
stages and pro rata as and when payments for the paid-in
shares are made. As of 31 December 1992, Japan, Sweden

and United States had deposited Instruments of Subscription
for their entitlements. Both Japan and Sweden had paid the
entire amount of their paid-in shares. Accordingly, their
subscriptions were effective in full. In December, the
United States paid for 3,151 of the 4,231 paid-in shares to
which it had subscribed. In accordance with Resolution
No. 195, the United States had until 31 March 1993 to
complete its payments.?

At the end of 1992, the Bank’s authorized capital stock
amounted to $23,224 million (SDR 16,890 million). The
subscribed capital stock stood at $23,100 million
(SDR. 16,800 million).

Repayments on OCR loans amounted to
$527.7 million, bringing cumulative repayments to
$4,544.5 million, including cumulative prepayments of
$1,054.8 million. At the end of 1992, outstanding loans
amounted to about $12 billion, representing about
54 per cent of the Bank’s total assets.

Income and Expenses

A growth of 12 per cent in the Bank's main operating
assets (composed of loans outstanding and investment
portfolio), resulted in an 11 per cent increase in the Bank’s
gross incorne to $1,345 million from $1,213 million in the
preceding year. Of the total gross income, $943 million was
generated by the joan portiolio and $392 million by the
investment portfolio.

The income yield from the loan portfolio (including
commitment charges), declined to 8.3 per cent from 8.5 per
cent in 1991 due mainly to the increasing share of loweryield variable rate loans in the portfolio (from 42.7 per cent
to 51.8 per ceni). The income yield on the investment

portfolio declined to 7.8 per cent from 9.1 per cent in 1991
due to lower interest rates in the major investment
currencies. The overall return on operating assets achieved
for the year was 3.2 per cent compared with 3.6 per cent
in 1991.

Total operating expenses amounted to $811 million,
up $115 million, or 16.6 per cent from the previous year.
The rise in expenses was due to the $120 million increase
in financial expenses, which rose by 19.7 per cent due
mainly to the increase in borrowings outstanding.
Administrative expenses decreased by $2 million and
services to member countries decreased by $3 million due
to the discontinuance in 1992 of the practice of using OCR
income to meet disbursements under grant-financed
technical assistance projects and programs. Total operating
expenses accounted for 60.3 per cent of the gross income,
compared with 57.3 per cent in 1991

Net income for the year, before appropriation of
guarantee fees io Special Reserve, amounted to
$535 million, a 3.2 per cent increase over ihe previous year.
This compared with a 1.8 per cent increase in net income
in 1991.Asian Development Fund

ADF and TASF Replenishment {ADF VI)

Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF)

replenishment (ADF VI} was authorized by Resolution
No. 214 of the Board of Governors in February 1992. The
replenishment, amounting to $4.2 billion at the average of
daily exchange rates during the first quarter of 1991 (the
exchange rates specified in the Resolution), is intended to
finance the Bank's concessional lending operations during
the four years from 1992 to 1995. Of the replenishment
total, $140 million is for allocation to TASF primarily for
project-related technical assistance to poorer DMCs and for
regional technical assistance. ADF VI came into effect on
20 August 1992 when the total amount of unqualified
contribution commitments received by the Bank exceeded
the minimum trigger of $2,100 million specified in the
Resolution.

By the end of 1992, ADF VI Instruments of
Coniribution had been received from 15 member countries
for a total amount of $2,956 million (at the Resolution
exchange rates). Fourteen of these countries, namely,
Australia, Austria, Denmark, France, Germany,
Hong Kong, Japan, Republic of Korea, Nauru,
New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and
Taipei,China, had deposited unqualified Instruments of
Contribution. Canada had deposited an Instrument of
Contribution containing a qualification, as permitted by the
Resolution, that all installment payments except the first
would be subject to budgetary appropriations. Pursuant to
the Resolution, the first tranches of all 15 contributions were
available to the Bank for operational cornrnitments. From
the first installment payment of each contribution, an
amouni, in proportion to the amount of the contribution,
was set aside anc aliocated to TASF in accordance with the
Resolution.

The Resoiution envisaged that the second tranches of
the unoualified contributions would become available for

T CURRENT Asian Development Fund (ADF) and

operational commitments on 1 January 1993 provided that, 
prior to that date, the Bank had received Instruments of

a qualified contribution, was unable to deposit its Instrument
of Contribution before the end of 1992, the availability of
the second tranches has been delayed.

Fourth ADF Replenishment (ADF V)

The fourth ADF replenishment (ADF V) was authorized
by Resolution No. 182 of the Board of Governors, adopted
on 1 October 1986, to finance the Bank’s concessional
lending operations over the four-year period from 1987 to
1990. In January 1992, a further $63.4 million of the
United States’ contribution became available to the Bank for
operational commitments. Of this amount, $28.9 million
was for the remaining 19.77 per cent of the third tranche
and $34.5 million was for 23.65 per cent of the fourth
tranche. The balance of the fourth tranche became available
during the remainder of 1992 ($61.6 million in April and
$50 million in December). Pursuant to the Resolution, the
release of the United States’ entire fourth tranche during the
year enabled the fourth tranches of other donors to also

_ become available. By the end of 1992, therefore, the full

amount of all ADF V contributions had been made available

* to the Bank.

ADF Commitment Authority

At the beginning of 1992, total ADF commitment
authority, i¢., the maximum amount of ADF lending which
the Bank could undertake with the resources available, was
about $582 million. During the year, the release of the
ADF V outstanding balance and the ADF VI first tranches
added $1,183.7 million and $656.8 million, respectively,
to ADF resources (at the exchange rates applicable at the
time of release).

Under the financial policies approved by the Board in
January 1991, the ADF lending limitation is defined as a
certain proportion, referred to as the gearing ratio, of
undisbursed resources. The ADF lending limitation at the
end of 1992 was about $6,880.8 million. The ADF lending
heacrcom (equa! to the cifierence between the lending
limitation and the amount of committed but undisbursed
loans} amounted to $1.001.8 million. In addition. the Bank
had advance commitment authority of $454.9 million

  

LAI{equivalent to 85 per cent of projected ADF investment
income and loan repayments during the period
1 January 1993 - 31 December 1995). The Bank’s total
ADF commitment authority at the end of 1992, therefore,
stood at $1,456.7 million.

Loan Disbursements and Repayments

ADF disbursements during 1992 amounted to
$887.5 million and brought cumulative disbursements from
ADF resources to $7,490.7 million at the end of the year.
Repayments during the year amounted to $61.1 million,
with cumulative repayments reaching $368.4 million..

ADF Revenue and Expenses

In 1992, the excess of ADF revenue over expenses {net
Income) was $106 million, bringing the accumulated surplus
to $735 million at the end of the year.

Gross revenue, consisting mainly of revenue from ADF
investments and service fees on ADF loans, amounted to
$171 million, while expenses, consisting mainly of
administration charge payable to ordinary capital resources,
was $65 million.

Porifolio Position

The ADF investment portfolio, denominated in 18
currencies, declined during the year to $937 million, of
which 46 per cent was held in securities issued or guaranteed
by member governments. The rest was invested in deposits
and other bank instruments in member countries, The return
on ADF investments was 7.6 per cent against 9 per cent in
1991. : .

ADF loans outstanding rose’ 8 per cent to
$8,183 million. The total ADF foans were concentrated in
Bangladesh (28 per cent}, Nepal (7 per cent}, Pakistan
{30 per cent) and Sri Lanka (11 per cent). The Japanese yen
and US dollars formed the bulk (70 per cent) of the ADF
loan portfolio.

Loans to Viet Nam were in non-accrual status. Total
outstanding loans to this country amounted to $31 million
or approximately 0.38 per cent of all outstanding ADF
loans.

Technical Assistance Special Fund

Pursuant to para. 3(b) of the Governors’ Resolution
No. 214 concerning ADF VI, the TASF portion of ADF VI
contributions accepted by the Bank as of
31 December 1992 amounted to $98.6 million (equivalent
to $98.5 million at the exchange rates specified in the
Resolution). Of this amount, $40.1 million had been utilized.

In September 1992, the Board of Governors also

112.

approved the reallocation to TASF of $50 million from the
1991 OCR net income previously allocated to surplus. As
at year-end, $9.9 million of this amount had been utilized.

During the year, Pakistan made a direct voluntary
contribution to TASF in the amount of $64,000 equivalent.
The contribution (Pakistan’s 16th) was partly untied,
available for use in financing the costs of services and
facilities procured from all DMCs. As of end-1992,
cumulative direct voluntary contributions committed to
TASF amounted to the equivalent of $85.3 million, of which
$85.2 million had been utilized.

 

RCAD construction in Western Samoa, one of the infrastructure
subprojects under a multiproject loan. The Bank has provided

$10.4 millionOperations and Resource Position

The TASF remained a major source (66 per cent) of
funding for services to member countries, with 184 new
projects approved during the year. The yield on TASF
investments declined from 11.1 per cent in 1991 to
8.8 per cent, which resulted in a 93 per cent decrease in the
revenue from investment to $0.21 million. However, there
was a larger volume of contributions committed during the
year ($50 million allocated surplus from ordinary capital
resources income, $99 million under the second regularized
TASF replenishment and $64,000 from Pakistan). Total
revenue and contributions amounted to $150 million.
Against the TASF undisbursed balances of $110 million,
there were outstanding commitments of $112 million.

The $65 million cash contribution received in 1992
funded the $45 million TASF expenditure, with the balance
being used to increase the investment portfolio.

At the end of the year, TASF investments stood at
$21 million. Other assets, comprising accounts receivable
from ADF and contributors, advances to consultants and
others, totalled $98 million. Accounts payable to consultants
and others amounted to $12 million.

Japan Special Fund

During 1992, the Government of Japan committed and
remitted a total amount of ¥8.77 billion (equivalent to about
$70.33 million) for its fifth year contribution to the Japan
Special Fund (JSF). The amount included ¥7 billion in
regular contributions and ¥1.77 billion in supplementary
contributions, and brought dapan’s cumulative
commitments to JSF since its inception on 10 March 1988
to ¥34.19 billion (equivalent to about $270.45 million).

The cumulative total included regular contributions
amounting to ¥30.8 billion (equivalent to approximately
$243.30 million) and supplementary contributions of
¥3.39 billion (about $27.15 million). The supplementary
contributions were to be used for symposia/training
(40.19 billion equivalent to about $1.49 million),

women-in-development activities (¥0.50 billion equivalent to
about $4.01 million), environment-related activities
(¥2.2 billion equivalent to about $17.64 million), and for
activities to promote the private sector (¥0.50 billion
equivalent to about $4.01 million}.

Of the total contributions received by the Bank,
$75.5 million had been utilized as of 31 December 1992,
including $74.2 million for technical assistance and
$1.3 million for equity investments. Funds awaiting
disbursements are invested, and in 1992 income from such
investments amounted to $7.9 million, down 21 per cent as
a result of a decline in interest rates. As agreed with the
Japanese Government, part of the investment income was
used to defray the Bank’s direct and identified administrative
expenses.

Operations and Resource Position

Even with a higher volume of investments, the revenue
from investments decreased by 21 per cent during the year
to $8 million as the realized rate of return on investment
declined from 7.5 per cent in 1991 to 4.6 per cent in 1992,
Total expenditure amounted to $27 million {up 21 per cent}
on services to member countries and $0.63 million {up
32 per cent) in administrative expenses.

With additional contributions cornmitted during the
year, there was an operational surplus, which raised
unexpended JSF balances to $221.5 million at the end of
the year.

The cash flow position remained satisfactory. The
$74 million received on account of contributions provided
the major source of funds. Together with the $8 million in
interest earned on investments, this was far in excess of the
required expenditure, and the surplus was used to increase
the investment portfolio.

At year-end, the quantum of JSF investments, including
equity investments of $1.3 million, stood at $222 million,
up 30 per cent. Other assets, comprising advances to
consultants and others, declined 24 per cent to $5 million,
while accounts payable (mainly for consulting services) stood
at $6 million.

supporting staff. During the year, there were 65
appointments and 49 terminations of professional staff,
while 83 supporting staff joined the Bank and 411 left.

To support implementation of the Bank’s MediumTerm Strategic Framework (1992-1995), it was decided to
establish a strategic planning and policy framework for the
management and development of its human resources.
A human resource strategy paper, the first to be undertaken
by the Bank, was initiated during the year.

A major review of the Bank’s Professional Staff
Performance Evaluation practices was undertaken in early
1992, introducing new rating categories and evaluation
criteria for professional staff at different levels of seniority.
A formal performance evaluation process was also
introduced for professional staff at higher levels and a panel
review process involving Management was instituted for all
levels to ensure consistency and transparency.

Several significant changes were made in 1992 in the
overall focus and orientation of the Bank's staff training
activities. These included a restructuring of the Bank’s
in-house training programs into four main streams: Basic,
Functional, Thematic and Information Technology. The
Bank has increased the allocation of funds to support the
training program, ensuring that training responds to the
career goals of its staff and its own needs.

The first round of the in-house Manager Development
Program (MDP), launched in August 1991, was successfully
completed with 52 graduates during the year and a second
round with 25 participants was — started.
A Workshop/Retreat was also held for the Bank's principal
officers to provide them with an opportunity to reflect on
major managerial issues and to facilitate dialogue arnong
theraselves on topical managerial, organizationa! and
administrative issues of concern to the Bank.

The Bank made its personnel policies and management
practices more iransparent with the publication of the
Personnel Handbook for Supporting Staff. The Bank started
publishing a quarterly in-house magazine, Bank Forum, to

Az END of 1992, the Bank had a staff of 1,776

CONSTRUCTION work in Thailand in connection with the Volunteer
Program for Naturai Resources and Environmental Conservation. The
program has received a $598.00 technical assistance grant from the
Bank.

 

"improve internal communication with staff. The members ~
” of the Administrative Tribunal held its first meeting at the

Bank's Headquarters in December 1992 and adjudicated its first case. .

The first phase of a study to develop professional staff
growth promotion guidelines was completed in July 1992.
The general objective of the study was to enhance clarity,

. consistency and fairness in the promotion practice for

professional staff.

Within the policy parameters of the new professional
staff compensation system, the Board considered and
approved, effective 1 June 1992, a 3.3 per cent structural
increase. Individual increases for professional staff were
determined on the basis of performance and relative
positioning within salary level.

For supporting staff, a comprehensive review of the
salary structure and policy was completed in August. A
number of recommendations to update and improve the
salary structure and policy were implemented, including the
introduction ‘of a new salary structure representing an
average structural increase of 25.7 per cent, effective
1 August 1992.

Staff Benefits ~

The Bank also introduced three new options for home
leave travel and made a temporary adjustment in its rental
subsidy program to reflect conditions in the local housing
market and exchange rate movements. A minor change was
made in the Staff Retirement Plan, effective
1 October 1992, to extend children’s benefits to
handicapped children, regardless of age. The dependency
allowance for supporting staff was increased.

The Bank continued its efforts to enhance the
recruitment and retention of women professional staff.
A study was conducted with the help of an external
consultant to highlight and address specific areas which
could contribute towards their career growth.

The Young Professional (YP) Program entered its ninth
year in 1992. New guidelines were implemented to improve |
coordination and forward planning of assignments with a
view to providing YPs with a wider exposure to the work of

Organizational Changes

In April 1992, the Bank established a Social
Dimensions Unit {SDU} within the Agriculture Department
to ensure that "cross-cutting" concerns, as identified in the
Bank's medium-term strategy, are adequately reflected in the
Bank’s operations. The unit will promote, catalyze,
coordinate and monitor Bankwide implementation of goals
and policies on poverty reduction, women in development,
human resource development, social analysis, project
benefit monitoring and evaluation, cooperation with NGOs
and other social concerns.

In July, the Agriculture Department was restructured
from six to five divisions, taking into account the projected
processing and administration workload. Country
responsibilities were realigned and professional staff were
reassigned among the five divisions to improve the
distribution of workload, widen the skill mix of each division
and ensure better control.

Also, in duly, a Private Sector Support Unit (PSSU) was 
established within the Private Sector Department (PSD) to
strengthen PSD Area Divisions and to develop
greater interaction between PSD and other operational
departments/offices to promote private sector alternatives
in country operational strategies.

In order to make the delivery of management services
to individual departments/offices and of human resource
development services to all Bank staff more effective, the

 

 
 

Budget, Personnel and Management Systems Department
(BPMSD) was restructured in November. The reorganization
integrated the Budget and Planning, and Systems and
Procedures Divisions into a single Budget and Management
Services Division (BPBM}; split the Human Resources
Division to create separate divisions for Human Resources
(BPHR) and Training and Development (BPTD); and
transferred the job evaluation and classification function
from the Compensation and Benefits Division (BPCB} to the
newly established BPTD.

Reappointment of Vice-President 
The Board of Directors, acting on the recommendation
of the President, reappointed Glinther G. Schulz as
Vice-President (Finance and Administration) for a further
three-year term beginning 1 July 1992.

Internal Audit

The Internal Audit Office GAO) furnishes all levels of
management in the Bank with periodic, independent and
objective appraisals and audits, including identification of
possible means to improve the efficiency and economy of
the Bank’s activities and the use of its resources. In view of
the independent nature of its function and role in the Bank,
IAO reports to the President and its activities are reviewed
by the Audit Committee of the Board.

During 1992, JAO’s principal activities were focused on
evaluation of, and reporting on administrative and financial
controls; review of the adequacy and effectiveness of
accounting and security controls pertaining to electronic
data processing systems; and assessment of systems and
procedures relating to loans and technical assistance. It also
played an active role in the audit of selected consultants’
contracts. IAO provided direct and integrated assistance to
the Bank’s external auditors, who were fully satisfied with
JAO’s performance,

IAO continued and expanded its services to assist other
departments and offices in the formulation and development
of new systems and procedures and the enhancement of
existing ones by providing inputs from an internal control
point of view.

The audit reports and the recommendations contained
therein, as well as the status of implementation of these
recornamendations, are conveyed periodically to the Audit
Cornmittee of the Board, and to the Management and staff
of the Bank. In reviewing IAO’s activities, the Audit
Committee was appreciative of its work and drew attention
to the importance of the internal audit function, which would
continue to increase as resources for funding development
activities become scarcer,Computer and Office Automation

The Office of Computer Services provides computing
capabilities at the Bank’s headquarters and resident and
regional offices. It expanded the mainframe data
communications network during 1992 offering on-line
mainframe access to about 1,800 terminals. An additional
300 desktop microcomputers, 101 portable computers and
276 printers were procured.

Several major systems development projects were
undertaken during the year, including the implementation of
the Enhanced Project Processing Information System, the
Domestic Consultant System, the Budget Review
Subsystem, the Insurance Administration Subsystem, the
Property and Materials Management System and the
Visitor Access Control System. Design work was started on
the Environment Monitoring Information System, the Work
and Time Management System, the Staff Retirement
System and the interface between the Banking Transaction
System and the SWIFT fund transfer network.

The Task Force on Information Technology (IT)
Strategy, established in August 1991 to formulate a
cost-effective IT strategy that would support the Bank's
mission and strategic objectives in the medium to long term,
submitted its report in September 1992. The strategy will
address the information needs of the Bank, particularly those
of senior staff and Management, through the
development of new systems and the enhancement of
existing ones. Further, an IT infrastructure based on a new
type of Bankwide network will be established to allow the
Bank to capitalize on its existing equipment and benefit from
the trend towards lower microcomputer costs. The
infrastructure will be expected to provide improved
communication, including access to external databases, and
additional flexibility. Through the use of new technologies,
the IT strategy will also make information more
accessible and easier to retrieve and facilitate the flow and
sharing of information among departments and offices.

ADMINISTRATION

  

Administrative Services

Two major capital project proposals submitted by the
Office of Administrative Services were approved by the
Board in 1992 for upgrading the communications facilities
and the printing plant of the Bank. Work on the proposals
began in the third quarter. Work also began during the year
to establish a full-fledged archives for the storage and
preservation of Bank records and documents. The role of
the library was also reviewed, a concept paper was prepared
and consultants were engaged to advise on library
automation.

Budget

The Internal Administrative Expenses (IAE) for 1992
amounted to $141.750 million against the original budget
of $145.612 million. The underutilization of $3.862 million
was mainly due to savings arising from lower-than-budgeted
expenses for staff consultants, business travel and
contractual services, which were partly offset by increased
expenses for staff benefits and depreciation.

The IAE Budget for 1993 of $161.930 million, as
summarized in Appendix 1, represents an increase of
$20.180 million over actual expenses of $141.750 million
incurred in 1992.

The increase is the result of: increments in staff years,
consultant services and business travel needed to support a
higher level and more complex nature of operational activities; substantial price adjustment for medical insurance
benefits; increased overhead expenses mainly on account of
two additional resident offices (one of which was opened in
India in Decernber 1992), higher costs of contractual services and depreciation of implemented capital projects; and
the provision for general contingency. Increases in other
Budget items are due to price escalation and the adverse
effects of a weaker dollar.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Benk's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disciosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall finencial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis jar our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Asian
Development Bank ~ Ordinary Capital Resources at 31 December 1992 and 31 December 1991 and the results
of its operations and its cash flows ior the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 1992 and 31 December 1991

i

NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of members are functional currencies. The
reporting currency is the United States dollar, and the
financial statements are expressed in thousands of current
United States dollars.

Valuation of Capttal Stock

The authorized capital stock of the Bank is defined in
Article 4, paragraph 1 of the Articles of Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter) ‘in
terms of United States dollars of the weighi and fineness in
effect on 31 January 1966” (the 1966 dollar) and the
value of each share is defined as 10,000 1966 dollars.
The capital stock had historically been translated into the
current United States dollar {the Bank's unit of account) on
the basis of its par value in terms of gold. From 1973 until
31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on this basis was
$1.20635 per 1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at which
time the Second Amendment to the Articles of Agreement
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect,
currencies no longer have par values in terms of gold.
Pending the Bank's selection of the appropriate successor
to the 1966 dollar, the capital stock has been valued for
purposes of these financial statements in terms of the
Special Drawing Right (SDR) at the value in current United
States dollars as computed by the IMF, with each share
valued at SDR 10,000.

As of 31 December 1992, the value of the SDR in terms of
the current United States dollar was $1.37500 ($1.43043
— 1991) giving a value for each share of the Bank’s capital
equivalent to $13,750.00 ($14,304.30 — 1991). However, the Bank could decide to fix the value of each share
at $12,063.50 based on the 31 March 1978 par value of
the United States dollar in terms of gold.

Translation of Currencies

Assets and liabilities are translated from their functional
currencies to the reporting currency generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period.
income and expense amounts are translated for each semimonthly period generally at the applicable rates of ex
change at the beginning of each period; such practice
approximates the application of average rates in effect
during the period. Translation adjustments other than
those relating to maintenance of value of currency holdings (see Notes G and K), are charged or credited to
“Accumulated translation adjustments”, Exchange gains or
losses on currency transactions among functional currencies are included in income. Currency swaps made in
connection with borrowings are hedged by forward exchange commitments and, accordingly, do not result in
any net exchange gain or loss.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Bank adopted a new accounting standard in 1992
which requires disclosure of the estimated “fair values” of
financial instruments. Such fair values are not recorded in
the accounis of the Bank, but are disclosed in the Notes to
Financial Statements as additional information.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximated their carrying value,

Financial instruments for which market quotations are .

available have been valued at the prevailing market value at
31 December 1992. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued
using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily
require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the
actual value at which such financial instruments could be
exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are
actually exchangeable is not determinable.

Investments

investment securities are reported at cost or amortized
cost, Gains and losses on sales of investments are measured by the difference between average cost or arnortized
cost and the net proceeds of sales.

Loans

The Bank's loans have been made to or guaranteed by
members or their governments, with the exception of
loans to the private sector, and have maturities ranging
between 10 and 30 years. The Bank requires its borrowers
to absorb exchange risks attributable to fluctuations in the
value of the currencies which it has disbursed. The Bank

has not suffered any loan losses to date and follows a
policy of not taking part in debt rescheduling agreements
on loans made to or guaranteed by members or their
governments. It is the policy of the Bank to place in nonaccrual status all loans in which principal, interest or other
charges are overdue by one year for loans made to or
guaranteed by a member and six months for loans to the
private sector. Interest and other charges on non-accruing
loans are included in income only to the extent that payments have actually been received by the Bank.

The Bank provides for possible losses on loans to the
private sector based.on an evaluation by management of
the collectibility of loans outstanding.

Prior to 1 July 1986, the lending rate of the Bank was
based on a fixed lending rate system under which loans
carried interest rates fixed at the time of loan approval tor
the entire life of the loans. Effective 1 July 1986, the Bank
adopted a pool-based variable lending rate’ system for
those loans approved on or after that date plus certain
others'at the option of the borrowers.

For leans to the private sector, interest is charged at
negotiated rates.

Equity Investments

Equity investments are reported at the lower of cost or
estimated net realizable value on an individual investment
basis. The allowance for possible loss of value below cost is
determined quarterly based on management's evaluation
of potential losses in the equity investments portfolio.

Property, Furniture and Equipment

Property, furniture and equipment is stated at cost and
except for land, is depreciated over estimated useful lives
on the straight-line method. Maintenance, repairs and
minor betterments are charged to expense.

Construction of a new headquariers ouilding was substantially completed in 1991 at a cost of $160,534,000 including capitalized interest (see Note H). Land for the
building was acquired at a cost of $10,052,000. During
1991, the Bank completed its transfer to the new building
and, under terms of an agreement with the Republic of the
Philippines (Government), the Bank returned the former

headquarters premises which had been provided by the
Government. In accordance with the agreement as supple~
menied bya memorandum of understanding, the Bank
was compensated $22,657,000 for the return of
premises. The compensation is in lieu of being provided
premises under the agreement and accordingly, is deferred
and amortized over the estimated life of the new headquarters building as a reduction of occupancy expense. The
amortization for the year ended 31 December 1992
amounted to $608,000 ($478,000 — 1991) reducing depreciation expense for the new headquarters building from
$4,301,000 ($3,849,000 - 1991) to $3,693,000
($3,371,000 — 1991). At 31 December 1992, the unamortized deferred compensation balance {included in “ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES — Miscellaneous”) was $21,571,000 ($20,362,000 - 1991).

The main building contractor of the Bank’s new headquarters building has indicated that it will seek to assert, in
connection with the construction of such building, claims
for additional payment of approximately $100,000,000
against the Bank. Certain legal issues which have a bearing
on part of such claims were the subject of an arbitration
which was concluded in Novernber 1992. On the basis of
present information, and in the light of the arbitration
proceedings, the Bank is of the view that such claims are
substantially without merit.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Bank
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS”. ©

NOTE B - RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF
CURRENCIES AND DEMAND
OBLIGATIONS OF MEMBERS

In accordance with Article 24, paragraph 2(i} of the Charter, the use by the Bank or by any recipient from the Bank
of certain currencies may be restricted by members to
payments for goods or services produced and intended for
use in their territories. With respect to the currencies of 32
developing member countries, cash in banks {due from

NOTE D - FAIR VALUE OF LOANS

Loans outstanding io or guaranteed by members or their
govemmenis with interest rates which vary based on the
pool-based variable lending rate system were fair valued
using an entry value method. Under this method, fair value
was determined based on the terms at which a similar loan
would currently be made by the Bank to a similar borrower. For such loans, fair value approximated the carrying value. For undisbursed balances of effective loans and
for loans not yet effective, the contractual amount approximated fair value.

Loans outstanding to or guaranteed by members or their
governments with fixed interest rates (principally loans
made prior to 1 July 1986) have been fair valued using a
discounted cash flow method. This method takes into
account the scheduled cash flows over the average life, by
currency, of the loans, current funding costs for the average life includes a factor for administrative costs. The
effect of possible prepayments was not considered material and was not included in the calculation.

The estimated fair value of loans to or guaranteed by
members or their governments was not affected by credit
risks based on the Bank's experience with its borrowers.

Loans outstanding to the private sector were not considered to be material to the loan portfolio and have been fair
valued at carrying value.

A summary of the caring vaiue and estimated fair value
of loans outstanding at 31 December 1992 were as

NOTE E ~ BORROWINGS AND SWAPS

The Bank enters into currency liability swap transactions in
which proceeds of borrowings are converted into @ different currency and simultaneously a forward exchange contract is executed providing for a schedule of future exchanges of the two currencies, thereby protecting the
Bank against any currency visk. It also undertakes interest
rate swaps, which transform a fixed-rate payment obligation in a particular currency into a floating-rate payment
obligation in that currency and vice-versa.

At 31 December 1992, the Bank had outstanding currency swap receivables aggregating $3,239,889 ,000
($2,308,474,000 - 1991) and payables aggregating
$3,487,476,000 ($2,532,004,000 — 1991). Nominal
amount of interest rate swaps outstanding totalled
$459 ,363,000 ($343,422,000 — 1991).

In connection with its swap agreements the Bank has a
poteniial risk of loss if the counterparty to such transactions fails to perform its obligations. For swaps on which’a
potential loss exists at 31 December 1992, the amount’ of
such potential loss, representing the estimated net cost of *
replacing the swaps at current market rates, aggregated
$31,821,000 and $20,830,000 for currency swaps and
interest rate swaps, respectively:

The Bank has definite policies governing the use of swaps
and the counterparties with whom it may have such agreerents. The Bank does not anticipate that any of its
counterparties will fail to perform its obligations under
such agreements.

The fair value of borrowings outstanding at 31 December
1992 was estimated using prevailing market prices where
available, or estimated replacement values where market
prices are not available.

Outstanding currency and interest-rate swap agreements
were fair valued at the estimated amount that the Bank
would receive or pay to ierminate the agreemenis based
upon market quotes from dealers.ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK - ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES

NOTE F - CAPITAL STOCK

The authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of
1,688,996 shares, of which 1,680,004 shares
(1,614,924 - 1991) have been subscribed by members.
OF the subscribed shares, 1,477,315 (1,419,961 - 1991)
are “callable” and 202,689 (194,963 - 1991) are “paidin”. The “callable” share capital is subject to call by the
Bank only as and when required to meet the Bank's
obligations incurred on borrowings of funds for inclusion in
its ordinary capital resources or on guarantees chargeable
to such resources. The “paid-in” share capital is payable or
has been paid in instalments, partly in convertible currencies and partly in the currency of the subscribing member.
In accordance with Article 6, paragraph 3 of the Charter,
the Bank accepts non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing demand obligations in satisfaction of the portion payable in
the currency of the member, provided such currency is not
required by the Bank for the conduct of its operations. The
settlement of such amounts is not determinable and, accordingly, the Bank does not believe that it is practicable to
fair value these receivables.

As of 31 December 1992, all matured instalments
amounting to $2,781,673,000 ($2,780,513,000— 1991)
were received except $365,000 ($430,000 - 1991). Instalments not due aggregating $5,301,000 ($8,296,000 1991) were receivable as follows:

31 December

1992 $ - $2,782,000
1993 2,675,000 2,782,000
1994 2,626,000 2,732,000

NOTE G - MAINTENANCE OF VALUE OF
CURRENCY HOLDINGS

Prior to 1 April 1978, the effective date of the Second
Amendment to the IMF Articles, the Bank implemented
maintenance of value in respect of holdings of member
currencies in terms of 1966 dollars, in accordance with the
provisions of Article 25 of the Charter and relevant resolutions of the Board of Directors. The “Amounts required to
maintain value of currency holdings” under “RECEIVABLE FROM MEMBERS” represent the aggregate
amounts receivable resulting from changes in exchange
rates of member currencies from those previously used for
the purpose of computing maintenance of value of the
Bank's holdings of certain member currencies. The settiement of such amounts is not determinable and, accordingly, the Bank does not believe that it is practicable to fair
value these receivables.

Since 1 April"1978, inasmuch as the valuation of the
Bank’s capital stock and the basis of determining possible
maintenance of value obligations are still under consideration, notional amounts have been calculated provisionally
as receivable from or payable to members in order to
maintain the value of currency holdings in terms of the
SDR. The timing of any establishment and settlernent of
such amounis is uncertain and, accordingly, the Bank does
not believe that it is practicable to fair value such receivables and payables. The notional amounts as of 31 December 1992 consisting of receivables of $497,174,000
($497,789,000 - 1991) and payables of $223,950,000

$327,499,000 ($403,241,000 - 1991) in amounts
required to maintain the value of currency holdings to the
extent of matured and paid capital subscriptions due to the

headquarters building - 1991).

Other financial expenses consist of amortization of borrowings issuance costs and other expenses of

carrying amount of borrowings extinguished prior to maturity of $17,401,000 and provision of $593,000
($500,000 — 1991) for possible losses on equity investments and private sector loans.

directly to ordinary operations and special operations) for
the year ended.31 December 1992 have been apportioned between ordinary capital resources and the Asian
Development Find according to the number of loans and

($134,879,000-— 1991), $64,913,000 ($51,802,000 —
1991) has accordingly been charged to the Asian Development Fund. :

NOTE I - SPECIAL RESERVE

The Special Reserve represents commissions on loans and
guarantee fees set aside pursuant to Article 17 of the
Charter. Special Reserve assets consist principally of govemment and government guaranteed obligations and are
included under the heading “INVESTMENTS”. For the

year ended 31 December 1992 guarantee fees amounting ©

to $246,000 ($122,000 - 1991) were appropriated to
Special Reserve. The commission charged on ioans was
discontinued after 1985.

NOTE J - CAPITAL TRANSFERRED TO
ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1{i) of
the Charter, the Board of Governors has authorized the
setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired “paid-in” capital
paid by members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(a) of
the Charter and of the convertible currency portion paid by
members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(b) of the
Charter as of 28 April 1973 to be used as a part of the

Special Funds of the Bank. The resources so set aside,
amounting to $65,463,000 as of 31 December 1992
($68,102,000 - 1991) expressed in terms of the SDR on
the basis of $1.37500 ($1.43043 - 1991) per SDR
($57,434,000 in terms of $1.20635 per 1966 dollar —

’ see Note A), were allocated and transferred to the Asian

Development Fund.

NOTE K - ORDINARY RESERVE AND
NET INCOME

Under the provisions of Article 40 of the Charter, the
Board of Governors shall determine annually what part of
the net income shall be allocated, after making provision
for reserves, to surplus and what part, if any, shall be
distributed to the members. Net income after appropriation of guarantee fees to Special Reserve for the year
ended 31 December 1991 was allocated to the Ordinary
Reserve, except $50,000,000; which was allocated to
Surplus and ‘subsequently reallocated and transferred to
the Technical Assistance Special Fund.

The restaternent of the’capital stock for purposes of these ae ‘
financial statements on the basis of the SDR instead of the.’

1966 dollar (see Note A) resulted in a net credit of
$18,625,000 to the Ordinary Reserve during the year
ended 31 December 1992 (net charge of $2,568,000°—
1991). That credit (charge - 1991) is the decrease (increase — 1991) in the value of the matured and paid capiial
subscriptions caused by the change during the period in
the value of the SDR in relation to the United States dollar

not allocated to members as notional maintenance of value.

adjustments in accordance with resolutions of the Board of
Direciors.

NOTE L - STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN

The Bank has a contributory Staff Retirernent Plan (the
Plan). Every employee, as defined under the Plan, shall, as
a condition of service, become a participant as of the first
day of service, provided that as of such a date, the empioyee shall not have reached the normal retirement date.

Participants are required to contribute 9 1/3% of their
remuneration to the Plan and may also make voluntary
contributions. The Bank has contributed amounts equal to
18 2/3% of the participants’ remuneration. The Bank's
contribution is determined ai a rate sufficient to cover that
part of the costs of the Plan not covered by ihe participants’ contributions. For the year ended 31, December
1992, the amount contributed by the Bank was
$11,151,000 ($10,014,000 - 1991).

Net periodic pension cost for the years ended 31 December 1992 and 31 December 1991 consisted of the following components:

The discount rate used in determining the actuarial present

svalue of the projected benefit obligation was 8%. The

effect of projected compensation levels was calculated
based on a scale that provides for a decreasing rate of
salary increase depending on age; beginning with 14% at
age 21 and decreasing to 5.50% at age 59. The expected
long-term rate of return on assets was 8%.

NOTE M - SERVICES TO MEMBER COUNTRIES

Services to member countries ($2,468,000 in 1991) represents ordinary capital resources income used to meet
disbursements under grant-financed technical assistance
projects and programs.

In 1992, the Bank discontinued this practice and adopted
a policy whereby amounts may be allocated from net
income and transferred to ihe Technical Assistance Special Fund, after approval by the Board of Governors, for
disbursement under its technical assistance programs.

NOTE N - GUARANTEES

The Bank extends guarantees for the benefit of its members which are not reflected in the financial statements. As
of 31 December 1992, guarantees outstanding amounted
to $109,463,000 ($102,626,000 - 1991). None of this
amount was subject to call as of that date.

The Bank estimates that the fair value of guarantees outstanding at 31 December 1992 is nil as no guarantees are
expected to be called.

NOTE O - LIMITATIONS ON LOANS, GUARANTEES AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS

Article 12, paragraph 1 of the Charter provides that the
total amount outstanding of loans, equity investments and
guarantees made by the Bank shall not exceed the total
amount of the Bank's unimpaired subscribed capital, reserves and surplus, exclusive of the special reserve. At
31 December 1992, the total of such loans, equity investments and guarantees aggregated approximately 86.8%
(77.7% - 1991) of the total subscribed capital, reserves
and surplus as defined.

Article 12, paragraph 3 of the Charter provides that equity
investments shall not exceed 10% of the unimpaired actu
 

3138OCR-8

i

ally paid-in capital together with reserves and surplus,
exclusive of the special reserve. At 31 December 1992,
such equity investments represented approximately 2.1%
(2.2% — 1991) of the paid-in capital, reserves and surplus,
as defined.

NOTE P ~ PRIVATE SECTOR

The Bank’s equity investments are made in private enterprises located in developing member countries and include
the Bank's investment of $35,224,000 ($35,240,000 1991) in Asian Finance and Investment Corporation Lid.
(AFIC).

The canying value of equity investmenis as of 31 Decem
ber 1992 was $117,433,000 ($105,880,000 - 1991),
net of allowance for possible iosses at 31 December 1992
of $2,624,000 ($2,500,000 — 1991). In 1992, an investment of $127,000 (nil - 1991) was written off. Equity
investments committed were $146,649,000
($146,839,000 - 1991) while equity investrnents disbursed were $126,437,000 ($112,712,000 — 1991).

 

Equity investments were not considered to be material and
were not fair valued.

Private sector loans outstanding as of 31 December 1992
were $236,044,000 ($195,656 ,000 - 1991), net of accumulated provision for possible loan losses as of 31 December 1992 of $342,000 {nil -— 1991}, while loans committed
were $457 ,038,000 ($430,176,000 - 1991). A committed loan to AFIC of $35,000,000 of which $75,000 {nil 1991) is outstanding at 31 December 1992, is included in
private sector loans.

In 1992, two loans were placed in a non-accrual status.
The principal amounts outstanding of these loans were
$6,161,000 of which $172,000 was overdue. Placing
these loans in a non-accrual status resulted in a reduction
in income from loans for 1992 of $979,000.

Also in 1992, debt rescheduling agreements were made
for two loans with principal amounts outstanding of
$8,349,000. The financial effect of such agreements was
not material.Deloitte &

i

NOTE A - GENERAL

The Asian Development Fund (the Fund) was established
on 28 June 1974 to carry out more effectively the special
operations of the Bank by providing resources on
concessional terms.

The resources of the Fund have been subsequently augmented by five replenishments, the most recent of which
was in August 1992 in a total amount equivalent to
US$4,200,000,000 to cover the operational requirements for the four years ending 31 December 1995. An
aggregate amount equivalent to $140,000,000 was allocated to the Technical Assistance Special Fund.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of contributing members are functional
currencies. The reporting currency is the Uniied States
dollar, and the finaricial statements are expressed in thousands of current United States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities and amounts available for loan commitments and advance payments on contributions are translated from their functional currencies to the reporting
currency generally at the applicable rates of exchange at
the end of a reporting period. Revenue and expense
amounts are translated for each semi-monthly period generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the beginning
of each period; such practice approximates the application
of average rates in effect during the period. Translation
adjustments relating to set-aside resources (see Note G) are
recorded as receivable from or payable io Ordinary Capital
Resources. Other iranslation adjustments are charged or
credited to “Accurnulated transiation adjustments”. Exchange gains or losses on currency transactions among
functional currencies are included in revenue.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Bank adopted a new accounting standard in 1992
which requires disclosure of the estimated “fair values” of
financia! instrurnents. Such fair values are not recorded in

 

the accounts of the Bank, but are disclosed in the Notes to
Financial Statemenits as additional information.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximated their carrying value.

Financial instruments for which market quotations are
available have been valued at the prevailing market value at
31 December 1992. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued
using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily
require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the
actual value at which such financial instruments could be
exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are
actually exchangeable is not determinable.

Investments

Investment securities are reported at cost or amortized
cost. Gains and losses on sales of investments are measured by the difference between average cost or amortized
cost and the net proceeds of sales.

Loans

Loans of the Fund are extended to eligible developing mermber countries, bear only a service charge and require repayment over périods ranging from 35 to 40 years. The Fund
requires borrowers to absorb exchange risks attributable to
fluctuations in the value of the currencies disbursed. The
Fund has not suffered any loan losses to date and follows a
policy of not taking part in debi rescheduling agreements on
loans made to or guaranteed by members or their governments. It is the policy of the Fund to place in non-accrual
staius all loans made to eligible developing member countries
if principal or service charges with respect to any such loan
are overdue by one year and six months overdue for loans to
the private sector. Service charges on non-accruing loans are
included in income only to the extent that payments have
actually been received by the Fund.

Contributions

Contributions by member countries are included in the
financia! statements as amounts committed from the date
Instruments of Contribution are deposited and related formalities are compieted.ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK - ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND

Contributions are generally to be paid in the currency of
the contributor either in cash or notes.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Fund
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS’.

NOTE C-INVESTMENTS .

As of 31 December 1992, the estimated market value of
investments was $936,150,000 ($1,176,404,000 1991), including investments not traded in the market
{time deposits, etc.) which were valued at their cost or
amortized cost of $591,623,000 ($1,007,513,000 1991). The currency composition of the investment portfolio was as follows:

 

 

Currency 1992 1991
Australian dollar $61,448,000 $ 92,511,000
Canadian dollar 23,395,000 84,175,000

Pound sterling 86,232,000 127,131,000
United States dollar 131,144,000 163,007,000
Others 146,247,000 187,194,000

Totals

$936,503,000  $1,176,096,000

During the year ended 31 December 1992, sales of invesiments resulted in a net gain of $578,000 ($196,000 1991). The annualized rate of return on the average investments held during the year, based on the portfolio held
at the beginning and end of each month, including realized
gains and losses, was 7.56% (9.01% — 1991).

Under the new accounting standard for fair value disclosures, market value is fair value.

NOTE D - LOANS

Loans made to Viet Nam (and Cambodia - 19911) were ina
non-accrual status as of 31 December 1992. The principal
amount outstanding at that date was $31,004,000
($31,299,000 - 1991) for Viet Nam of which
$7,995,000 ($6,705,000 - 1991) was overdue
($1,374,000 for Cambodia - 1991). Overdue service
charges on these loans totalled $3,879,000 ($4,039,000
- 1991}. Placing these loans in a non-accrual status
resulted in a reduction in revenue from loans for the year
ended 31 December 1992 of $552,000 ($561,000 1991).

On 4 November 1992, Cambodia paid in full its arrears
and therefore its loan ceased to be in non-accrual status.
As a result, revenue from loans for the year ended
31 December 1992 increased by $739,000 corresponding to revenue that would have been accrued up to
4 November 1992.

Under the new accounting standard for fair value disclosures, loans are fair valued using an entry value method.
Under this method, fair value was determined based on the
terms at which a similar loan would currently be made by
the Bank to a similar borrower. For such loans, fair value
approximated the carrying value. The estimated fair value
of loans was not affected by credit risks because the
amount of any such adjustment was not considered to have
a material effect based on the Bank's experience with its
borrowers.

NOTE E - NOTES OF CONTRIBUTORS

Notes of contributors are non-negotiable, non-inierestbearing and, subject to certain restrictions imposed by
applicable Board of Governors’ resolutions, encashable by
the Bank at par upon demand.

The Bank currently expects that the notes outstanding at
31 December 1992 will be encashed in varying amounts
during the five-year period ending 31 December 1997.

Notes of contributors were fair valued using an entry value
method whereby fair value was determined based on the
terms at which notes are currently being accepted from
contributors. On this basis, fair value of outstanding notes
of contributors approximated carrying value.

NOTE F - ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND
ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

Administrative expenses include an administration.charge
amounting to $64,913,000 ($51,802,000 - 1991). The
charge represents an apportionment of all administrative
expenses of the Bank (other than those appertaining
directly to ordinary operations and special operations}
based on the number of loans and equity investments
approved for the year.

NOTE G - SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1 () of
the Articles of Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank {the Charter}, the Board of Governors has
authorized the setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired
“paid-in” capital paid by members pursuant to Article 6,
paragraph 2 (a) of the Charier and of the convertible
currency portion paid by members pursuant to Article 6,
paragraph 2 (b) of the Charter as of 28 April 1973, to be
used as a part of the Special Funds of the Bank. The
capital so sei aside was allocated and transferred from the
Ordinary Capital Resources to the Fund as Set-Aside
Resources.

The capital stock of the Bank is defined in Article 4,
paragraph 1 of the Charter, “in terms of United States

dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on 31 January
1966” (the 1966 dollar). Therefore, Set-Aside Resources
had historically been translated into the current United
States dollar (the Bank's unit of account), on the basis of its
par value in terms of gold. From 1973 until 31 March
1978, the rate arrived at on this basis was $1.20635 per
1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at which time the
Second Amendmeni to the Articles of Agreement of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect, currencies no longer have par values in terms of gold. Pending the Bank’s selection of the appropriate successor to
the 1966 dollar, the Set-Aside Resources has been valued
for purposes of the accompanying financial statements in
terms of the Special Drawing Right (SDR), at the value in
current United States dollars as computed by the IMF. As
of 31 December 1992, the value of the SDR in terms of
the current United States dollar was $1.37500 ($1.43043
— 1991). On this basis, Set-Aside Resources amounted to
$65,463,000 ($68,102,000 — 1991). if the capital stock
of the Bank as of 31 December 1992 had been valued in
terms of $12,063.50 per share, Set-Aside Resources
would have been $57,434,000.

- NOTE H - PRIVATE SECTOR

Private sector loans outstanding as of 31 December 1992
were $14,591,000 ($8,313,000 - 1991) while loans
committed were $15,701,000 ($15,912,000 — 1991).Touche

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 1992 and 31 December 1991

an

NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currency and Reporting Currency

The functional currency of the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF} is deemed, as a matter of convenience, to
be the same as the reporting currency, the United States
dollar. The financial statements of TASF are expressed in
thousands of current United States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities and unexpended balances in currencies
other than United States dollars are translated at the
applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting
period, Contributions committed during the year are
translated initially at applicable exchange rates as of the
respective dates of commitment. As to cumulative contributions committed, the utilized portions have been translated at the applicable exchange rates as of the respective
dates of use whereas the unutilized portions are translated
at the applicable exchange rates as of the end of a reporting period, with resulting translation adjustments included
in contributions committed. Revenue and expense
amounts in currencies other than United States dollars are
translated for each semi-monthly period generally at the
applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each
period; such practice approximates the application of average rates in effect during the periad. Translation adjustments are accounted for as exchange gains or losses and
are charged or credited to operations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Bank adopted a new accounting standard in 1992
which requires disclosure of the estimated “fair values” of
financial instruments. Such fair values are not recorded in
the accounts of the Bank, but are disclosed in the Notes to
Financial Statements as additional information.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximated their carrying value.

Financial instrurnents for which market quotations are
available have been valued at the prevailing market value at
31 December 1992. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued

   

using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily
require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the
actual value at which such financial instruments could be
exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are
actually exchangeable is not <leterminable.

Investments

Investment securities are reported at cost or amortized
cost. Gains and losses on sales of investments are measured by the difference between average cost or amortized
cost and the net proceeds of sales.

Contributions

Contributions by member countries are included in the
financial statements as amounts committed from the date
contribution agreements become effective.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the TASF
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS’.

NOTE B - INVESTMENTS

As of 31 December 1992, the estimated market value of
investments was $21,316,000 ($6,545,000 - 1991), including investments not traded in the market (time deposits, etc.) which were valued at their cost or amortized cost
of $19,990,000 ($1,875,000 - 1991). The investment
portfolio was composed of $14,106,000 {nil ~ 1993)
dapanese yen, $1,958,000 ($9,000 ~ 1991) Australian
doliar and $5,249,000 ($6,514,000 — 1991) other currencies. The annualized rate of return on the average
investments held during the year, based on the portfolio
held at the beginning and end of each month was 8.83%
(11.14% - 1991). Under the new accounting standard for
fair value disclosures, market value is fair value.

NOTE C - FUNDING

Since 1967, contributions have been made by 31 (30 1991) member countries. In February 1992, the Board of
Governors, in authorizing a $4,200,000,000 replenishment
of the Asian Development Fund, provided for an allocation
to the TASF in an aggregate amount equivalent toTASF-6

nt

$140,000,000 to be used for technica! assistance to poorer
developing members and for regional technical assistance.
This replenishment became effective in August 1992.

In September 1992, the Board of Governors reallocated
the $50,000,000 surplus from the 1991 net income of the
Ordinary Capital Resources to the TASF.

NOTE D- SERVICES TO MEMBER COUNTRIES
The Bank’s outstanding commitments for grant-financed

technical assistance projects and programs totalled approximately $111,831,000 as of 31 December 1992

 

 

($108,732,000 — 1991). Technical Assistance Special
Fund resources are used for these commitments. The fair
value of such commitmenis approximated the amounts
outstanding because the Bank expects that grants will be
made for all projects and programs covered by the commitments. When technical assistance provided as a project
preparatory grant leads to a Bank loan, the amount of the
grant exceeding $250,000 will be refinanced under the
loan. Refinanced amounts of $847,000 were charged to
loans and credited to revenue from other sources of the
TASF during the year ended 31 December 1992
($113,000 - 1991).3158

31 December 1992 and 31 December 1991

NOTE A - GENERAL

The Japan Special Fund (JSF) was established in March
1988 when Japan and the Bank entered into a financial
arrangement whereby Japan agreed to make an initial
contribution and the Bank became the administrator. The
purpose of JSF is to help developing member countries of
the Bank restructure their economies and broaden the
scope of opportunities for new investments, thereby assisting the recycling of funds to developing member countries
of the Bank, The Bank may invest the proceeds of JSF
pending disbursement and use the income from such investments to pay for direct and identifiable costs incurred
in the administration of JSF.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currency and Reporting Currency

The functional currency of JSF is the Japanese yen while
the reporting currency is the United States dollar. The
financial statements are expressed in thousands of current
United States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities and unexpended balances are translated
from the functional currency to the reporting currency at
the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting
period. Contributions committed have been translated at
the applicable exchange rates as of the respective dates
received, Revenue and expense amounts in Japanese yen
are translated for each semi-monthly period at the applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period; such
practice approximates the application of average rates in
effect during the period. Exchange gains or losses on
currency transactions between the Japanese yen and other
currencies are charged or credited to operations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Bank adopted a new accounting standard in 1992
which requires disclosure of the estimated “fair values" of
financial instruments. Such fair values are not recorded in
the accounts of the Bank, but are disclosed in the Notes to
Financial Statements as additional information.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK - JAPAN SPECIAL FUND

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximated their carrying value.

Financial instruments for which market quotations are
available have been valued at the prevailing market value at
31 December 1992. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued
using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily
require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the
actual value at which such financial instruments could be
exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are
actually exchangeable is not determinable.

Investments

Investment securities are reported at cost or amortized
cost. Gains and losses on sales of investments are measured by the difference between average cost or amortized
cost and the net proceeds of sales.

Equity Investments

Equity investments are reported ai cost. Equity investments
were not considered to be material and Were not fair
valued. .

Contributions

Contributions by Japan are included in the financial statements as amounts committed from the date indicated by
Japan that funds are expected to be made available.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the JSF
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS”.

NOTE C - INVESTMENTS

As of 31 December 1992, the estimated market value of
investments was $220,203,000 ($169,266,000 - 1991)
including investments not traded in the market (time deposits) which were valued at their cost or amortized cost of
$96,768,000 ($2,728,000 - 1991). The investment
portfolio was composed wholly of Japanese yen. The
annualized rate of return on the average investments heldJSF-4

A

during the year, based on the portfolio held at the begin“ning and end of each month was 4.56% (7.51% — 1991).
Under the new accounting standard for fair value disclosures, market value is fair value.

NOTE D - SERVICES TO MEMBER COUNTRIES

The JSE’s outstanding commitments for projecis and
programs totalled approximately $64,557,000 as of

‘

 

 

31 December 1992 ($53,323,000 -1991). The fair value
of such commitments approximated the amounts outstanding because JSF expects that disbursements will be
made for substantially all the projects and programs
covered by the commitments.|

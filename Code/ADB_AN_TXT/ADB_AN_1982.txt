eSThe Asian Development Bank

The Asian Development Bank, an internationa! parinership of 45 member nations, is engaged in
promoting the economic and social progress of its developing member countries in the Asia-Pacific
region.

The Bank started functioning in December 1966 with its Headquarters in Manila, Philippines. It
is owned by the governments of 31 countries from the Asia-Pacific region and 14 countries from
Europe and North America.

in 16 years of operations, the Bank has become a major catalyst in promoting the development
of the most populous and fastest growing region in the world today. The Bank’s principal functions
are (i) to make loans for the economic and social advancement of developing member countries;
{ii} to provide technical assistance for the preparation and execution of development projects and
programs and advisory services; {iii} to promote investment of public and private capital for development purposes; and (iv) to respond to requests for assistance in coordinating development policies
and plans of member countries. In its operations, the Bank is also required to give special attention
to the needs of the smaller or less developed countries and give priority to regional, sub-regional and
national projects and programs which will contribute to the harmonious economic growth of the
region as a whole. ,

The financial resources of the Bank consist of ordinary capital resources, comprising subscribed capital, reserves and funds raised through borrowings; and Special Funds, comprising contributions made by member countries and amounts previously set aside from the paid-in capital.
Loans from ordinary capital resources, which account for about 70 per cent of Bank lending, are
generally made to member countries which have attained a somewhat higher jevel of economic
development. Loans from Special Funds, which are administered in the Asian Development Fund,
are made almost exclusively to the poorest borrowing countries on highly concessional terms.

The Bank has borrowed funds for Its ordinary operations from the capital markets of Europe,
Japan, the Middle East and the United States. It has also sold two-year dollar-denominated bonds to
central banks or monetary authorities of its members. The Bank’s callable capital which currently
accounts for nearly 81 per cent of its subscribed capital backs its borrowings in the capital markets.

The Bank’s operations cover the entire spectrum of economic development, with particular emphasis on agriculture, energy and social infrastructure. Most Bank financing is designed to support
specific projects, in certain cases, the Bank also provides program, sector and multiproject loans.

With the growing need for larger and more diversified inflows of capital to the region, the Bank
is actively expanding its co-financing activities, with official as well as commercial and export credit
sources. Steps have also been initiated for the Bank’s entry into equity investment operations.

The Bank’s highest policy-making body is its Board of Governors which meets annually. The
direction of the Bank’s general operations is the responsibility of the Board of Directors — composed
of 12 Directors (each with an Alternate) — eight representing regionaf countries and four representing non-regional countries. The Board of Governors conducts an election for the Board of Directors
every two years.

The President of the Bank is elected by the Board of Governors for a term of five years, after
which he may be re-elected. The President is Chairman of the Board of Directors and under its direction he conducts the business of the Bank. in this he is assisted by the Vice-Presidents, who are appointed by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the President.

The Bank has 19 departments and offices — including a Resident Office in Dhaka, Bangladesh
— dealing with various operational, financial, administrative and genera! support functions.}

COVER: Loading arms for liquefied natural gas (LNG) atop a Bank-financed berth at Bintulu Deepwater
Port in Sarawak, Malaysia. The Bank approved a $53.8 million foan in November 1979 to assist in the
development of the port, which commenced operations in January 1983. As the focal point of a dynamic
new regional growth center and the only deepwater port in the area, Bintulu will serve as the principal
outlet for Sarawak’s main industrial and agricultural exports — LNG from offshore gas fields, ammonia
and urea from petro-chemical industries currently being established, and paim oif and timber from the
comparatively underdeveloped but potentially rich hinterland.Board of Directors

DURING 1982, a year of worldwide recession and considerable economic difficulty, the Bank took a number of
important steps to Strengihen its resource position and
enhance its growing role as an instrument and a catalyst of
development in the Asia-Pacific region.

Negotiations were concluded with donor countries for a
third replenishment of the Aslan Development Fund (ADF)
to finance the Bank's concessional lending program over
the four-year period 1983-1986. A review of the Bank’s
ordinary capital resources was continued In order to determine the appropriate size of a third General Capital
increase.

During the year, there were significant increases in the
Bank’s co-financing activities and borrowings in the international capital markets, and the Bank examined additional measures designed to stimulate in the coming
years the inflow of funds — particularly from commercial
sources — to the region.

Bank lending during the year amounted to $1,731 milion
sompared with $1,678 million in 1981. Bank lending increased by 3.2 per cent in nominal terms in 1982, while over
the tive-year period 1978-1982 the annual increase averaged
14.3 per cent in nominal terms. Annual growth rates should
be viewed in the context of a longer-term trend, however,
and the decline in the rate of growth in 1982 was mainly due
to exceptional factors, including adverse exchange rate
changes which resulted in a significant reduction in
available ADF resources. it was also a reflection of growing
domestic resource constraints and reductions in development expenditures by some of the Bank's developing
member countries (DMCs) as they attempted to adjust to
the effects of the continuing recession in the world
economy,

Total disbursements during the year amounted to $795
million compared with $667 million in 1881, The average
size of loans rose from $29.4 million in 1984 to $30.4 million
in 1982.

Other highlights of 1982:
* A Study of the Bank’s Operational Priorities and Plans
for the 1980s was completed.

* Co-financing with commercial and export credit
sources nearly-doubled-to $276 million from $146 million

 

in 1981, and total co-financing rose to $699 million from
$627 million.

* The Bank undertook 14 borrowings amounting to the
equivalent of $882 million compared with $668 million in
1981; it entered the Dutch domestic capital market for
the first time and re-entered the United States capital
market after an interval of six years.

» @ A consultant of high international standing was com
missioned to prepare a comprehensive study of the
Bank’s financial policies,

* An in-depth Bank-sponsored Agriculture Sector
Strategy Study of Nepal was completed.

* Major seminars on Co-Financing with Commercial and
Export Credit Sources and Equity Financing Operations
were held in Manila.

1979LENDING ACTIVITIES: During the year, ihe Bank approved 57 loans for 56 projects in 13 DMCs compared with
57 loans for 54 projects In 15 DMGs in 1981. Loans from ordinary capita! resources (OCR) amounted to $1,184.5
miiilon, an Increase of 3.3 per cent in nominal terms over
the corresponding figure of $1,147 million in 1981, while
loans from Special Funds (SF), amounting to $546.1 million,
showed an Increase of 2.9 per cent In nominal terms over
the 1981 concessional lending figure of $5371 million. In
1982, about 98 per cent of SF loans went to DMCs which
had a per caplta gross national product (GNP) of fess than
$300 tn 1980.

The total cost of projects approved — excluding seven
development finance institution (DFi) and two sector loans
— Is estimated at $3,337 million. Direct Bank financing accounted fos about 46 per cent of the total project costs. Of
the rest, co-financlers provided about 18 per cent while the
balance was provided by the DMCs themselves.

It ls estimated that the total cost of the subloan projects
io be financed by the seven DFi loans wil! be about $347.4
mililon. The projects to be flnanced by the two secior loans
will involve an estimated total investment cost of $127
milllon.

During the year, 26 projects Involved co-financing, with
$699 million contributed by co-flnanclers and $878 miltion
by the Bank. As in the past, most of the Bank’s co-financing
was with bilateral and multitatera! official sources which
together contributed $423 milion or 61 per cent of total cofinancing during the year. Co-financing provided by commerclal and export credit sources amounted to $276 million
or 39 per cent of the total compared with $146 milllon or 23
per cent in 1981,

LENDING BY SECTOR: Over the five-year period
1978-1982, Bank assistance to the Agriculture, Energy and
Social Infrastructure sectors has recorded sharp Increases,
reflecting the high priority given to these sectors by the
DMCs and the Bank. Correspondingly, Bank fending to
other sectors has grown at a slower pace or has tended to
decilne (see graph on page 3).

Durlng 1982, the Bank continued to Increase the range
and volume of Its lending for the Agriculture and AgroIndustry sector which accounted for 35.9 per cent of totai
lending compared with 32.3 per cent in 1981. Bank ioans
supported, among other things, Improvements to irrigation,
drainage and flood control facilities, agricultural support
services and feeder road networks, agro-processing and
marketing, cotton development, Integrated agricultural and
tural development, agricultural credit and the development
of forestry, fisheries and livestock.

The share of the Energy sector in total tending rose from
28.6 per cent In 1981 to 29.7 per cent in 1982. Bank loans
covered, among other things, development of indigenous
energy resources, especially hydropower, and the provision
of transmission and distribution factlitles for electricity
and naturai gas.

The share of Social Infrastructure projects — those
designed to improve water supply and sanitatlon systems,
provide low-income housing, develop urban infrastructure,
and upgrade educational and health and population programs In DMCs — fall from about 22 per cent of total Bank
lending in 19871 to about 10 per cent in 1982, This decrease
followed an unusually steep Increase of over 60 per cent in
Bank lending to this sector In the previous year.

Bank fending to development finance institutions (DFis)
— credit lines from which subloans are made to meet the
medium and long-term credit requirements of small and
medium-scale Industries — was aiso lower in 1982 and
comprised 8.6 per cent of total lending compared with 42.2
per cent in 1987.

Conversely, there was a significant increase In lending
for Transport and Communications, which accounted for
almost 15 per cent of total lending In 1982 compared with
4.3 per cent In 1981. Bank loans supported the construction, rehabilitation and Improvement of rural and provincial
roads, the provision of microwave tetecommunication links
and consultant services for the development of ports.

Agriculture and Agro-Industry: The Bank continues to
assign the highest priority to this sector because of itscrucial importance for the economies of most DMCs.

During the year, the Bank extended 22 project loans, including three technical assistance loans and one supplementary loan for a project previously approved. One
large loan was approved as a credit line to augment the
foreign exchange resources of an agricultural development
bank for financing agro-industrial projects in the private
sector, .

As part of the Bank’s efforts to assess the needs of its
DMCs in this sector, and in order to formulate the appropriate strategies for responding to such requirements,
Bank staff and consultants completed a comprehensive
Agriculture Sector Strategy Study of Nepal in association
with the Government of Nepal.

Bank lending to this sector in 1982 amounted to $621
million in 22 loans compared with $542 million in the same
number of joans in 1981.

Energy: The Bank's Regional Energy Survey (RES),
which was completed in 1981, clearly delineated the needs
and prospects of the DMCs in the Energy sector, and Bank
activities in 1882 also took into account RES findings and
recommendations. Five of the 11 loans approved in this
sector during the year were for the development of indigenous resources; four were for the provision of extrahigh voltage electricity transmission and distribution lines;
and two were for the transmission and distribution of gas.

Most of the projects included components for institutionbuilding and training.

The Bank also hosted an Energy Planning Coordination
Meeting in February, the objective of which was to promote
improved coordination of technical assistance activities in
the Energy sector among major donor agencies in the AsiaSouth Paclfic region. .

Bank lending to this sector in 1982 amounted to $514
million in 11 loans compared with $480 million in the same
number of loans in 1981.

Social Infrastructure: Bank lending for social infrastructure projects — water supply and sanitation
(sewerage), urban development, housing, education and
health and population facilities — declined in 1982 after
the steep rise of 60 per cent recorded in the previous year,
In terms of three-year averages, Bank lending to this sector
showed an increase from $181.9 million in 1977-1979 to
$255.4 million in 1980-1982, reflecting the high priority given
to social infrastructure projects both by the Bank and its
DMCs,

In the Water Supply and Sanitation sector, the Bank in recent years has supported simple water and sanitation projects in provincial or rural areas as well as major water supply and sewerage systems in large cities. This reflects its
strategy of promoting balanced growth and improving the
health of rural and urban communities. Bank foans in 1982

In the Urban Development sector, the Bank’s objective is
to support programs which are almed at improving living
conditions In crowded fow-income urban areas and which
lead to more efficient urban growth. One joan to this sector
in 1982 will provide a wide range of basic facilities for new
fown development as part of a major resource-based
regional development scheme.

Bank support in the Education sector has in the past
focused mainty on technical and vocational education.
Recently, however, the Bank has also begun to support ihe
development of general and science education in order to
help augment manpower resources and occupational skills
In DMCs. Bank loans to this sector in 1982 will help develop
vocailonai education in Indonesia, technical education in

1982 approved two foans in the Health and Population sector: one to improve an Integrated system for the delivery of
health and famlly planning services in Sri Lanka, and the
other to upgrade and equip health centers in rural areas in
Papua New Guinea.

During 1982, Bank lending for social infrastructure projects amounted to $173.5 million compared with $364.8
million in 1981, Of the 1982 iotal, loans for Water Supply
and Sanitation projects amounted to $57.9 million ($123.7
million in +984}, Urban Development to $30.2 million ($99.3

The Bank recognizes the importance of mineral resource
deveiopment in its DMCs, and in 1982 there was considerable follow-up work of earlier technical assistance for
upgrading national facilities for mineral resource surveys
and exploration programs. During the year, the Bani approved a $16.2 million loan for a tin mining project in Burma
compared wiih one Joan of $13 million to this sector in 1981.

Development Banks: Development finance institutions
{DFls}) remain the most suitable conduit for Bank
assistance to small and medium-scaie projects, mostly in
the private sector, which are not large enough to warrant
direct Bank financing. In addition, the Bank pays attention
to strengthening the managerial as weil as the financial
resources of DFis in order to make them more efficient instruments of national development. The Bank has aiso
helped establisn new DFIs. particularly in the South Pacific
region.

During 1982, the Bank made seven loans amounting to
$148.5 mitlion for six projects in this sector compared with
six loans amounting to $204 million in 1981. They ranged in
size from $1 million for the Development Bank of Vanuatu
to $50 million for the Small and Mediurn Industry Bank of
Korea.

Transport and Communications: Bank lending to this
sector increased sharply in 1982 after several years of
relative decline and an exceptionally low level of tending in
1981, when it accounted for only 4.3 per cent of total lending. in 1982, several road projects were taken up in DMCs
and the share of Transport and Communications accounted for nearly 15 per cent of Bank Sending.

Responding to the demand of DMCs for reliable low-cost
transportation infrastructure and services, the Bank approved loans in 1982 to help upgrade rural and national
roads in three DMCs and a major national highway in a
fourth. One loan for ports development was also approved.

After an interval of eight years, the Bank made its first
joan for telecommunications, $29 million for a new
microwave system linking, inter alia, two major cities in
Pakistan.

During the year, the Bank made six loans amounting to
$257.4 miliion in this sector compared with two loans
amounting to $72.4 million in 1981.

DISBURSEMENTS AND LOAN ADMINISTRATION:
Loan disbursements from OCR and SF totalled $795 million
in 1982 compared with $667 million in the preceding year.
Disbursements under OCR loans improved from $518
million to $620 million, while disbursements under SF loans
improved trom $149 million to $175 million. As of the end of
1982, cumulative disbursements were $3,442 million from
OCR and $1,062 million from SF.

A total of 375 loans were under administration in 1982.
Thirty-six projects were completed.

During the year, 189 loan administration missions were
undertaken to review the physical progress of projects and
deal with specific loan administration matters. In addition,
17 joan disbursement missions explained disbursement
procedures and helped expedite the submission to the
Bank of ioan withdrawal appiications, In response to the reGuests of certain DMCs, two special project implementa

Studies on the performance of three borrowing DMCs in
implementing projects were undertaken in 1982, bringing to
six the number of country profile reports prepared by the
Bank.

During the year, a number of measures to streamline internal procedures were instituted, including the implementation of some of the recommendations of a committee set
up in 1981 to examine loan administration practices. These
measures involve, among other things, greater delegation
of authority, simplification of procedures and streamlining
of workflows. j

Two regional seminars on procurement and one on project implementation management were held in Manila; °
country seminars on procurement were also held in three
DMGs. In addition, a Handbook on Procurement was completed and a Handbook on Recruitment of Consultants
prepared.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: The Sank provided
technical assistance (including technical assistance for
regional activities) for 80 projects in 1982 compared with 62
projects in 1981, while the total amount increased from
$16.6 million to $18 million in 1982. Of this, $15.5 million
was for project preparatory and advisoryfoperational
technical assistance for 56 projects compared with $14.8
million for 49 projects in 1981. The overall increase in the
number and amount of technical assistance projects largely reflected the greater emphasis now being given by the
Bank to regional activities, for which grants rose from $1.8
million for 13 projects in 1981 to $2.5 million for 24 projects
in 1982.

On a sectoral basis, 51.8 per cent of the total amount of
technical assistance approved in 1982 was for Agriculture
and Agro-Industry compared with 56.2 per cent in 1981.
About 28.7 per cent was provided to the Energy sector, and
the rest to Transport and Communications, Development

POST-EVALUATION: Post-evaluation of completed
Projects provides vaiuable information for policy making
and for gulding operational activities and improving subsequent project Implementatlon. Post-evaluation has,
therefore, emerged as an important management tool for
the Bank and the executing agencies in its DMCs.

During 1982, 23 Project Performance Audit Reports
(PPARs) were prepared covering projects in 11 DMCs. As of
31 December 1982, a total of 81 PPARs had been prepared.
Of the 91 projects completed prior to the end of 1978, 57
have been or are being post-evaluated. The Bank proposes
to post-evaluate all projects completed since 1979 for
which Project Completion Reports have been prepared.
During the year, the Fourth Review of Past-Evaiuation
Reports was issued. It covered 22 projects post-evaluated
in 1981 and made a number of recommendations In relation
to future operations.

During the year, work began on four special studies to examine the effectiveness of certain operational activities
and to evaluate thelr Impact -~ a fisheries sector impact
study, and three studies on the effectiveness of executing
agency arrangements, project-related technical assistance
and training in DFIs.

POLICY REVIEWS: Durlng the year, the Board of Directors reviewed a wide range of operational and financial
policies of the Bank, including proposais for a third General
Capital Increase. The Board also submitted to the Board of
Governors for approval a Report and draft Resolution on
the third Aslan Development Fund replenishment (ADF 1¥).

Other policy papers considered by the Board in 1982 included: revisions to Ordinary Operations Loan Regulations
and Special Operations Loan Regulations, Allocation of Administrative Expenses Between Ordinary Capital
Resources and Asian Development Fund, Cooperation with
the European Economle Community, Co-Financing with
Gommerclai and Export Credit Sources, Equity investment
Operations of the Bank, Post-Evaluation Activities, Procedural Guidelines for Speciai Increases in Capital
Subscriptions, Annual Review of the Financial Policies of
the Bank, Lending Rate Review and Revised investment
Guidellnes.

LENDING RATE: The Bank's lending rate on ordinary
loans was increased from 10.10 per cent to 11.00 per cent
per annum effective 1 January 1982. This rate, which was
reviowed in August, remained In effect for the entire year,

ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES: The authorized
capltal stock of the Bank as of 31 December 1982 stood at
$7,985.1 million (SDR7,220,6 million), of which the subscribed portion amounted to $7,898.7 million (SDR7,160.4
Mlilion}.

As of 31 December 1982, total subscriptions under the
second General Capital Increase amounted to $4,511.4
million (SDR4,089.7 miition). An amount of $42.0 million
(SDR38.1 million) remained available for subscription.

During 1982, the Bank undertook 14 borrowings amounting to the equivalent of $881.8 million compared with a total
equivalent of $668.5 million in 1981. The Japanese market
remained the largest source of borrowings in view of the
availability of funds’ in that market on relatively favorable
terms. Over 35 per cent of the total borrowed in 1982 was
denominated in Japanese yen.For the third year in succession, the Bank undertook two
public bond issues in the Swiss capital market where interest rates were Comparatively low. The Bank also floated
three public bond issues in the Federal Republic of Germany and for the first time raised longer-term funds in the
Dutch domestic capitai market through two public bond
issues. The Bank also re-entered the US capital market
after 2 prolonged absence with a public offering in July ot
zero coupon notes. Two-year US dollar bonds totalling $68
million were placed with central banks and monetary
authorities in 27 member countries. Tne Bank also made a
private placement in the Middle East. The average maturity
of the year's borrowings, weighted by amount, was 8.93
years, which had the effect of increasing the average life of
outstanding borrowings from 7.03 years at the end of 1981
to 7.41 years at the end of 1982.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND: During 1982, negotiations were concluded for a third Asian Development Fund
replenishment {ADF IV) to finance the Bank’s concessional
lending program over the four-year period 1983-1986. The
developed member countries agreed to provide a total of
about $3,205 million. In addition, four developing member

 

countries agreed to make contributions totalling $9.5
miliion.

The fourth instalments of unqualified contributions to
the second ADF replenishment {ADF Ill) became available
to the Bank for loan commitments in February following
receipt of the third instalment of the United States contribution. The fourth instalment of the United States contribution was received by the Bank in December. in view of
a possible shortage of ADF resources by the end of the year
as a result of the continuing strength of the United States
dollar during the final quarter, the Board of Directors in
December approved three loans totalling $85.9 million subject to the condition that they would be signed only after
the necessary resources became available.”

During the year, the Bank received further payments
totalling $18.6 million from tne United States towards the
balance of its contribution to the first ADF replenishment
{ADF Il). These payments reduced the outstanding baiance
of the United States contribution to ADF Hl to $37.9 million.

Stitute fright), two of five high-priority institutes provided with facilities, equipment and training under the Applied Research
InStitutes Project in thé Republic of Korea for which the Bank hes approved a $33 miifion loan.OUTLOOK: Due to the duration and severity of the
global recession now afflicting the international economy,
the near-term economic prospects of the majority of the
Bank's member countries are not encouraging.

Therefore, 1983 ts envisaged as a year of consotidation
and internaf strengthening in which major efforts will be
directed to improvements in the Bank's work processes
and cosi effectiveness with a view to achieving greater
results with a rejatively small increase in internal
resources. Thess (mprovements will include greater delegatlon of authority, improved internal communications, making more effective use of available resources through staff
redeployment, work streamlining and procedural improvements and further advances !n computer and office
automation systems.

Along with these efforts, which are expected to lead io a
substantial improvement in the quailty of the Bank’s operatlonal activities, follow-up work will continue on a Study of
the Bank's Operationa! Priorities and Plans for the 1980s
which was completed in 1982. This will entall Board consideration of major policy Issues, improvements regarding
country and sector programming, modifications of Bank
regulations and procedures and upgrading of the Bank’s
analytical capacity. tmplementation of the recommendations emanating from the Study is expected to have a
significant impact on the thrust of development policy work
and the future direction of the Bank's operations.

A study of the Bank's financiat policies was also started
in 1982 and is nearlng completion. This Is Intended to provide guidance on longer-range financial policy formulation,
planning and management. Similarly, a study on the
streamlining of loan administration, completed in 1982, Is
expected to lead to greater efficiency and delegation of
authority in loan administration activities.

Policy dialogues with the DMCs will become a more Important part of the Bank’s operations in 1983 and beyond.
Within the Bank, this involves setting up analytical and
coordinating mechanisms for the systematic identification
and examination of policy issues and for determining the
Bank’s position with respect to such issues. Externally, It
requires the Identification of appropriate mechanisms In
each country for Initiating and conducting policy
dialogues. These will be initiated with member countries on
selected issues to the extent possible with existing Information, analyses and contacts. The growing diversity of the
Bank's development policy work and its impact on Bank
operations and the development efforts of DMGs will reguire greater accent on policy and operational coordination
within the Bank and further attention to aid coordination
with other development financing organizations active in
the region.

During 1983, the Bank will focus its research on those
issues that reflect the economic conditions and concerns
of the DMCs and are relevant to policy dialogues with these
countries. Expanded economic policy research and
analysis are planned and will include the major areas of
trade and industry, energy, regional cooperation, financial
development, aid flows, labor productivity and employment, as wel] as the international economic environment

and economic evaluation of projects. Efforts will also be
made to strengthen and computerize the Bank's statistical
Information system to allow quick and easy reference to
economic indicators of DMCs. During the year the Bank's
training and institution-building activities in its DMCs will
also Increase.

In 1983, a symposium on Development Strategies in Asia
will be organized In Manila on the eve of the Bank’s Sixteenth Annual Mesting. Also scheduled is a Development
Roundtable for senior policy makers from DMCs, developed
countries and Bank staff. During the year, the first semiannual edition of the Asian Devetopment Review wiil also
be published.

The Bank's future resource requirements for its ordinary
operations have been under study since 1980. A number of
papers concerning a third General Capital Increase were
discussed by the Board of Directors during 1982 and the
Board’s specific recommendations were expected to be
submitted to the Board of Governors In early 1983,"

As far as the Bank’s concessional lending program is
concerned, the Bank will not be able to make any further
loans until the third ADF replenishment (ADF iV) becomes
effective, or unless there Is a significant exchange rate
movement In favor of the Bank. The target date for the effectiveness of ADF IV ts 31 May 1983.

Recent developments have made it clear that not only Official Development Assistance, but also bond issues by
DMCs, syndicated loans by commercial banks, private
direct Investment and other new techniques will have to be
employed to increase the total capital inflow to developing
countrles.

The external resource requirements of the Bank's DMCs
are projected to rise from about $27 billlon in 1980 to
around $63 billion In 1990. As the Bank itself will be able to
mest only a fraction of these needs, considerable efforts
will be needed to attract co-financing in Bank-assisted pro}ecis, especially from commercial and export credit
sources. Subject to the approval of the Board of Governors,
the Bank also hopes to make a modest start in equity investment operations during 1983 with a view to catalyzing
the flow of funds, both domestic and external, to private
sector development in the DMGs?

At the end of 1982, the issue of greatest concern facing
the Bank was the size and composition of its third General
Capital Increase, which had been proposed to cover the
program of fending from its ordinary capital resources over
the years 1983-7987. It was expected that the capital increase as well as the third ADF replenishment (ADF iV)
would come into effect during the first half of 1983. These
developments will enabie the Bank, as an effective regional
development finance institution, to continue to perform a
vital role in the development of the region in the years
ahead, .

*ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

PARTI: THE REGION

JHE BANK’'s developing member countries (DMCs)
registered significantly lower economic growth in 1982
than in 1981. This was due to several factors, such as sluggish domestic and external demand, depressed export
prices for most primary commodities, a slowdown in new
investment, particularly in the private sector, and reduced
agricultural production in countries that suffered from
adverse weather conditions. The aggregate trade deficit of
the region widened. The combined gross domestic product
{QDP) of DMCs grew at 3.8 per cent in 1982. Though this
growth rate was considerably lower than the past trend, it
was better than that of some other major regions of the
world. The average rate of inflation in the region declined
and this relative price stability compared favorably with
that of other developing regions.

international Setting

The year 1982 proved difficult both for industrialized and
developing countries. Worldwide recession and high
unemployment continued during the year. Overat! world
output stagnated, while an upturn in investment was inhibited by sluggish demand, the existence of large
underutilized production capacity and high interest rates. It
was increasingly realized that structural problems affecting the world economy were deep-rooted and could not be
soived quickly.

The good performance of the food sector was a redeeming feature in an otherwise dismal! record of production. According to the estimates of the Food and Agriculture
Organization {FAO}, world cereal production in 1982
reached a record fevel of 1,553 million tons, compared with
the output of 1,513 million tons in 1981. Many countries
also achieved some success in moderating inflation rates
as a result of strict monetary and fiscal management and
low prices of foodgrains and many raw materiats.

Real gross national product (GNP) of the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) fell by 0.5 per cent in 1982 compared

with an increase of 1.2 per cent in 1981, Decline in industrial
production was widespread as prospects of an early
recovery dimmed. Weakened demand eased pressures on
prices and consumer prices increased by 7.5 per cent in
1982 compared with 9.4 per cent in the previous year.
Higher unemployment gave rise to increased demand for
protectionism in some industrialized countries. The volume
of trade of OECD countries declined during 1982, attributabie in part to reduced oil shipments. The aggregate
current account deficit of OECD countries is estimated to
have increased to $39 billion from $31 billion In 1981.

Oil exporting countries as a group experienced a sharp
decline of 4,7 per cent in real growth as their oi} production
fell for the third consecutive year, resulting in a marked
deterioration in their current account surplus.

Non-oil developing countries experienced a general
deterioration in their overall economic performance. Their
GDP growth rate declined sharply from 2.8 per cent in 1981
to 1.8 per cent in 1982. Reduced demand in OECD and oii
exporting countries depressed commodity prices and
limited the growth. of exports of the non-oil developing
countries. As a result, the domestic purchasing power of
non-oil developing countries was affected. High interest
tates aggravated the debt-service burden of many of these
countries, particularly those which relied heavily on commercial borrowings to finance their external deficits. International commercial banks adopted a cautious attitude
toward lending to developing countries because of the
uncertain economic prospects and a few cases of debt
rescheduling outside the region. As a result, doubts arose
regarding the capacity of the international financial system
to finance growing deficits of developing countries.

Economic Developments in DMCs

The overall economic performance of DMCs, as
measured by their GDP growth rate, reached one of the
lowest levels in the past two decades. Aggregate output of
15 DMCs" grew by 3.8 per cent in 1982, weil below the rate
of 6.4 per cent achieved in 1981.

 

1 At the time of writing this report, GDP estimates for 1952 were available
only for 15 DMCs, These countries together account for about 98 per cent
of the GDP of all DMCs,

GDP Growth

Of the DMGs listed in Table 1", only Burma and Pakistan
had higher rates of growth in 1982 than In 1981. Most DMCs
experienced a sharp dectine in their GDP growth, far below
their tong-term average growth rates of the preceding
decade. This was true even of those countries which experienced relatively fast growth in the past.

Some major factors responsible for adverse developments in DMCs can be Identified. In South Asia, GDP In
Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka grew at lower rates
principaily because of a decline In agricultural production
caused by poor weather. in Southeast Asla, Indonesia,
Maiaysla, Philippines and Thailand suffered economic
slowdowns mainly because of fow external demand for
thelr primary export commodities. The newly industrializing
countries (NICs)? recorded lower economic growth fargely
due to shrinking overseas markets for thelr manufactured
exports. High interest rates affected economic growth In
the DMCs through their adverse Impact on investment
activitles at home and reduced Inventory demand for their
exports abroad.

Sectoral Performance
The overail index of agricultural production showed a

much smafsler increase in 1982 than in the previous year for

1 The tables referred Lo in this chapter appear on pages 94 - 104.

2 Four DMCs (Republic of China, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea and
Singapore) are Included in this group on the basis of high shares of
manufacturing output in their GDP and exports.

a majority of DMCs for which data are available. Growth of
agricultural production was affected, particularly in some
of the large DMCs (Indla, Indonesia, Philippines and
Thalland) which faced drought conditions. Low prices and
declining export demand for most agricultural commodities
also affected growth.

The total output of major foodgrains' in DMCs — rice,
wheat and maize — feil below the record level of 285 million
tons In 1987 to 278 milion tons in 1982 {see Tables 2 and 3).
The dectine of 7 miilion tons was mainly due to a fall in the
production of rice {in terms of paddy) from 211 million tons
in 1981 to 263 million tons in 1982. India alone suffered a
decline of 9.5 million tons. Reduced rice production in other
countries such as Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and
Thaitand was more than offset by higher production in
Bangladesh, Burma, Republic of China, Indonesla,
Republic of Korea, Philippines and Viet Nam.

Wheat output, estimated at 54 million tons during 1982,
showed an Increase of 1.3 million tons over the level of
1981. The entire increase can be attributed to higher production in India whose output accounts for about 70 per
cent of the production of al! DMCs. Increases In production
in Afghanistan, Burma and Nepal were offset by a decline
in Bangladesh.

1 The estimates of outpul of foodgrains In this chapter are for the calendar
year, while GOP estimates ara for the fiscal year. This accounts for
discrepancies In the case of a DMC whose fiscal year Is different from the
calendar year (see footnotes to Table 4}.

GRAINS OUTPUT OF DNCs,
1975-1982

Index 1975 = 160
160Overall production of maize in DMCs decreased by one
million tons from 22 million tons in 1981 to 21 million tons in
4982. India's output of maize declined by 500,000 tons,
while that of Thailand and Indonesia fell by 400,000 tons
and 300,000 tons, respectively. The decline was partly offset by modest gains in the Philippines and some other
countries.

The production performance of other major agricultural
crops was also mixed. Production of natural rubber in the
DMCs grew by 2.3 per cent in 1982, with Malaysia coniributing about half of the total production of 3.4 million
metric tons. Coconut production picked up slightly (1.1 per
cent) in 1982. Most of the increase was accounted for by Indonesia and Philippines.

In marked contrast, sugar and palm oil production grew
by 36.4 and 23.5 per cent, respectively. India, Indonesia,
Philippines and Thailand were the major producers of
sugar, while Indonesia and Malaysia produced most of the
paim oil. Output of both jute and tea, mostly produced in
South Asia, declined by 11 and 5.5 per cent, respectively.
Cotten production, accounted for mostly by India and
Pakistan, increased by 5.6 per cent in 1982.

Growth in the output of the manufacturing sector in
DMCs was considerably lower in 1982 than in 1981. Siuggish demand for exports affected the growth of this sector
in the NICs. Their exports, most of which comprised
manufactured products, declined by 1 per cent in 1982 compared with an increase of 13.2 per cent in 1981.

In Southeast Asian DMCs, lower earnings trom primary
commodity exports led to sluggish domestic demand which
slowed down the growth of the manufacturing sector. Stagnant external demand for manufacturing exports was
another contributory factor.

In South Asia, poor performance in agricultural production affected the manufacturing sector both by weakening
the growth of domestic demand and by reducing the
availability of inputs to agro-based industries. The only exception was Pakistan where the growth rate of manufacturing output rose from 11 per cent in 1981 toe 13.2 per cent in
1982 because of improved capacity utilization in both the
public and private sectors.

Complete data on electricity generation in DMCs during
1982 are not available. Sased on partial information, it is
estimated that electricity generation increased by 4.6 per
cent during the yeat as compared to an increase of 6.7 per
cent in 1981.

Oil production in the region declined by 5 million metric
tons, from 411 million metric tons in 1981 to 106 million
metric tons in 1982 (see Table 4). Production in Indonesia
declined by 13 million tons to 66 million tons, which was
below the quota allocated to it by OPEC. Increased production in Burma (0.6 mitlion tons), India (4.8 million tons),
Malaysia (2.4 million tons) and Philippines (0.2 million tons)
partiy offset the decline in Indonesia.

Output of natural gas continued to increase in 1982.
Most of the nine DMCs which are significant producers of
natural gas reported gains in output. The largest increases
in natural gas production were registered by Bangladesh
(30 per cent) and Thailand (60 per cent). Output dectined in
Afghanistan (4 per cent) and Republic of China (18 per
cent).

Preliminary data indicate that there was a decline in the
total value of oil imports in the region from $41 billion in
1981 to $40 billion in 1982 (see Table 4). Lower petroleum
prices and a reduciion in the volume of imports contributed

to the decline. Oil imports declined by $0.7 billion in
Republic of China, $0.2 bitlion in Hong Kong, $6.3 billion in
India, $0.8 billion in Republic of Korea and $0.3 billion in
Thailand. However, the ratio of oil import costs to the total
export earnings of DMCs continued to be high as there was
simultaneous decline in exports. The ratio of total oil imports to total value of exports from the region stood at 27.9
per cent in 1982, ciose to the 28 per cent ratio in 1981.

Price Trends

The inflation rate in the region fell steadily over the past
two years. The weighted increase in consumer prices was
145.7 per cent in 1980, 13.1 per cent in 1981 and 8 per cent in
1982 (see Table 5). The fall in commodity prices (including
oil and foodgrains) and domestic stabilization polictes contributed to the decline in prices in most DMCs. Inflation
tates declined sharply in Republic of China, Cook Islands,
Fiji, India, Republic of Korea, Papua New Guinea, Sri
Lanka, Thailand and Vanuatu. Burma, Malaysia and
Singapore continued to maintain their good records of
price stability in recent years and experienced inflation
rates of 4 to 6 per cent. However, inflation rates significantly increased or remained at double-digit levels (despite
some declines) in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Hong Kong,
Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka and some of the South Pacific
DMCs. Inflation in Indonesia and Kiribati stayed at singledigit levels despite some increases during the year.

Domestic Savings, Investment and Resource Gap

Data on domestic savings, investment and resource gap
relating to 14 DMCs for the period 1979-1981 (Table 6) show
that gross capltal formation (GCF) as a percentage of GDP
averaged’over 26 per cent In nine DMCs, between 15 to 25
per cent in three, and below 15 per cent in two. However,
the ratio of gross domestic savlags (GDS) to GDP was considerably below that of Investment in most DMCs, reflecting their substantial dependence on external resources.
GDS averaged over 25 per cent of GDP In flve DMCs, between 15 to 25 per cent In five, and was below 15 per cent in
the other OMCs. The resource gap, measured as the difference between GCF and GDS as a ratio of GDP, averaged
over 10 per cent In two DMCs, 5 to 10 per cent In seven, and
fess than § per cent in five. .

The ratio of aggregate resource gap to GDP declined in
several DMCs in 1987. Of the 14 DMCs for which data are
available, seven showed a decline. The remaining seven
countries showed an increase, ihe increase being particufarly pronounced In the cases of Malaysia and Papua New
Guinea. In some cases, the decline in the resource gap was,
however, due to a fail in the investment ratio rather than an
improvement in the domestic savings ratio. Declines in investmentiGDP ratios in 1981 in several DMCs highlighted
thelr inadequate Investible resources and increasing constraints on their growth prospects, Although data for 1982
are not available, there are indications that the resource
gap of DMCs may have narrowed further, largely because
ot a decline in the ratio of investment to GDP.

External! Sector Developments

The combined trade deficlt of DMCs rose from $22 billion
In 1981 to $26 bililon in 1982 (see Table 7). The increase is
attelbutable largely to higher deficits in Mataysia, Pakistan
and Singapore and a sharp reduction in the trade surplus of
Indonesia, The total deflolt of these DMCs, excluding Indonesla, increased by $1.9 billion, while Indonesia’s trade
surptus plunged from $9 billion In 1981 to $2.2 billion in 1982.
For the first time in several years, Malaysia experienced a
sizeable trade deficit. The largest reductions in trade deficit
were recorded by Republic of Korea ($2.4 billion} and
Thailand {$1.2 billion}, Afghanistan and Republic of China
were the only DMCs which experienced an increase in trade
surplus.

Export prices of major primary commodities, except jute
and coffee, decreased in 1982. The greatest declines were
ragistered by rice and sugar (36 and 44 per cent, respectively) Compared with average prices during the period
1977-1880, export prices declined sharply. Copra went
down by 34 per cent, sugar by 29 per cent, jute and rubber
by 19 per cent, and tea and paim ol by 18 per cent.

The aggregate value of exports of DMCs decreased by
3.4 per cent from $148 bliiilon in 1981 to $144 billion in 1982.
The decline was mainly accounted for by Bangladesh,
Republic of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Pakistan, Philippines, Slngapore and Thailand where exports slgnificanily declined from the 1981 level. In contrast,
a few DMCs, including India and Republic of Korea, experienced significant increases In thelr exports.

RATIO TO IMPORTS

 

The total imports of DMCs decreased slightly from $170
billion in 4981 to $169 billion in 1982, Decreases in imports
were notable in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Republic of
China, Fiji, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea, Pakistan, Philippines and Thailand. However, a few DMCs (Indonesia,
Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka} recorded substantially
higher imports in 1982.

The terms of trade of DMCs during 1982 were generally
unfavorable. Data on export and import unit values
available for DMCs show that the terms of trade declined
significantly in Bangladesh, Maiaysia, Pakistan, Phitippines and Thailand, and improved in Republic of China and
Republic of Korea. Many of the other OMCs which depend
heavily on exports of primary commodities also appear to
have experienced worsening terms of trade during the year.

Data on the direction of trade flows of DMCs in 1981 —the latest year for which figures are available — show that
dapan and the United States remained their two largest
trading partners, absorbing 18.9 per cent and 19.3 per cent,
respectively, of the total exports of DMCs and accounting
for 20.9 per cent and 14.2 per cent, respectively, of the total
imports. However, trade of DMCs with oil-exporting countries (excluding indonesia) increased significantly,
accounting for 13.1 per cent of the total imports of DMCs,
and 7.2 per-cent of their total exports in 1981. More
significantly, there was a considerabie expansion of trade
among DMCs themselves. The share of intra-DMC exporis

in total exports increased from 19 per cent in 1976 to 26 per
cent in 1981, while intra-7DMC imports’ share in total imports increased from 15 per cent to 20 per cent.

fter many years, the international reserves of DMCs
showed a significant decline and amounted to $41 billion at
the end of 1982 compared with $46 billion at the end of 1981
(see Table 8). A number of countries experienced a decline
in reserves — Afghanistan, Burma, india, Indonesia,
Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea,
Philippines and Thailand. Only two countries — Repubtic of
China and Singapore — added to tneir reserves significantly. The level of reserves at the end of 1982 was equivalent to
3.4 months’ imports compared with 3.8 months’ imports in
1981.

The net flow of external resources to DMCs rose from $14
billion in 1980 to $20 billion in 1981, the latest year for which
data are available (see Table 9}. The increase is fully attributable to non-concessiona! flows which rose from $5.9
billion-in 1980 to $12 billion in 1981, while concessional
flows fell from $8.2 billion to $7.8 billion.

Reflecting the continued inflow of external resources,
the external public debt outstanding of OMCs is estimated
to have increased from $84 billion in 1980 to $94 billion in
4981' or by 12 per cent (Tabie 10). The corresponding debtservice payments increased from $9.2 billion in 1980 to $11

billion In 1981. There were wide differences in the debtservice ratios of Individual DMCs, ranging from 0.2 per cent
in the case of Solomon Islands to 40 per cent in the case of
Western Samoa. Since these ratios relate to official debt,
they understate the debt-service burden of DMCs, such as
Republi! of Korea and Philippines, which were able to raise
substantlal amounts in debits not guaranteed by governments. Nevertheless, the ratlos represent adequately the
debt-service burden of a majority of BMCs which rely mostly on officlal loans. For many of these DMCs, the debtservice ratio remains low due to a high grant element in the
total Inflow of thelr external resources. In some cases, an
Increase In the ratio was moderated or reversed by the
cancellation or rescheduling of debt repayments altowed in
racent years by some lenders.

Policy Initiatives of DMCs

The continuing chaifenge of sustalning economic growth
and improving distributive equity in DMCs was made more
diffloult by an unfavorable domestic and externa! environment In 1982. The DMCs took several policy Initiatives to
solve thelr problems. Some notable examples of these —
relating to fiscal and monetary policles, trade, energy and
human resources — are given below In order to Illustrate
the nature and dimensions of the DMCs’ efforts.

Fiscal and Monetary Pollcles

During 1982, the DMCs took a wide range of measures in
the areas of fiscal and monstary management to promote
economic growth with price stability. Several DMCs scaled
down non-essential current expenditure and low priority invesiment followlng reduction in revenues, while others
tried to increase government revenues to narrow thelr
resource gaps. Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are
notable examples of countrles in which public sector
developmental expenditure was curtalled because of
reduced availability of budgetary resources. Bangladesh
and indonesia reduced the use of budgetary resources for
subsidizing food and fuel. Philippines and Thailand
adopted reforms to improve their domestic resource
mobifization. A shift to taxation of gross salary and wages
in the Phillppines and a 10 per cent surcharge on import
dutles In Thaliand Illustrate this trend. India provided tax incentives to encourage domestic savings and to induce investment in the country by non-resident Indian citizens.
Malaysla raised the rates of taxes on a number of nonessential goods produced domestically or imported.
Republic of China, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia
and Singapore tried to pursue reflationary budgetary
policies to offset declines in private investment.

Monetary pollcies in most DMCs became more restrictive
during the year. Some DMCs (Bangladesh, Pakistan, Philippines and Sri Lanka) put resirictions on the expansion of
domestic credit fo public and private sector borrowers.
Republic of Korea and Philippines Introduced reforms to
Improve the workIng of their financial markets. The dectine

in Inflation rates improved the real Interest rates in many .

DMGs to positive levels.

External Trade Pollcies

Several DMCs, Including India, Philippines and Thailand,
maintained their import liberalization programs through
seduction in high rates of tariffs and easing of import
restrictions and administrative controls. However,’ declin
ing export earnings and lower availability of external
resources reduced the capacity of several DMCs to import.
Consequenily, some countries found It necessary to adopt
special measures to reduce thelr imports. The Philippines
Introduced a 3 per cent across-the-board increase in import
duties and Bangladesh, Fiji and Malaysia adopted
measures to discourage luxury imports. indonesia tightened controls over 126 import items.

Currencles of many DMCs depreciated against the US
dollar during 1982. Notable examples are Bangladesh (18.7
per cent}, Pakistan (16.4 per cent), India (8.1 per cent), Sri
Lanka (7.7 per cent), Philippines (7.6 per cent}, Nepal and
Republic of Korea (6.7 per cent), Burma (6.4 per cent), Indonesia {6.3 per cent), Republic of China (5.5 per cent) and
Thailand (5 per cent). Depreciation against the US dollar occurred in several countries due to a polley of maintaining
parity of currencies with the baskets of currencies to which
they were linked and depreciation of many of the currencies in the baskeis In relation to the US doliar.

Several DMCs Introduced speclfic measures in 1982 to
boost their sagging exports. Indla ltfted a ban on the export
of sugar and lowered income tax on export profits of firms
whose export turnover in FY 1983 would excsed that of the
previous year by 11 per cent. Indonesia reduced costs of export credit, established export Insurance and guarantee
facilities, simptified customs clearance procedures and terminated export earnings surrender requirements. it also introduced new regulations on the export of logs while taking
steps to increase the export of plywood. Malaysia
established the necessary infrastructure for exporting liquefled natural gas (LNG) by early 1983 from its Bintulu
plant in Sarawak. Singapore decided to set up a new Trade
Development Board to prepare and implement policies
conducive to natlonal trade promotion. The Philippines
stepped tip efforts to attract more foreign manufacturers of
semiconductors. Nepal promulgated the Industrial Enterprises Act and Trade Policy to promote private industrial investments and to expand exports. During the year,
Thalland, which fifted the ban on sugar exports, eliminated
cassava quotas and reduced taxes on rice in late 1981,
launched a structural adjustment scheme for several indusirles with a view to making them competitive in the international market.

Energy Programs and Policies

In spite of the relief provided by a moderate decline in the
price of oil, DMCs continued to assign high priority to
reducing their heavy dependence on energy imports. India
and Philippines made considerable progress in this regard.
Major investments In the Energy sector were undertaken by
several other DMCs (Bangiadesh, indonesia, Republic of
Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan and Thailand}.

In addition to pursuing projects to increase production of
Gomestic energy resources, many DMCs raised the prices
of petroleum and petroleum products to reflect the prevailing cost of oil in the international market. Republic of
Korea, Nepal and Republic of China sed others in this
regard, raising the price of a liter of gasoline to $1.34, $0.78,
and $0.73, respectively, by the end of 1981 — well above its
international price. In some other DMCs, the cost of
gasoline ranged from $0.64 a liter (in India) to $0.13 a liter (in
Burma). The price was still very low in Burma ($0.13 a liter),
while Indonesia increased the price in 1982 (by 60 per cent)
to $0.36 a liter, though it was still below the international
price. Some DMCs which continued to increase the price ofgasoline in 1982 as part of their energy conservation programs were Bangladesh, Hong Kong, India, Republic of
Korea and Thailand, While gasoline is not the most important petroleum product used in DMCs, the price of gasoline
usually sets the pace of adjustment in the prices of other
petroleum products. However, diesel oi] used in mass
transportation, industry and pump irrigation, and kerosene
used by the low-income groups continued to be relatively
low-priced in most DMCs.

Human Resources Development Policies

Humen resources development remained an important
goal in DMCs as a means of increasing national productivity and improving the standard of living of less privileged
sections of societies.

Investmenis in education and vocational training continued to receive special attention duriing the year in mast
DMCs. A number of countries initiated new programs in
these fields either on their own or with assistance from external sources. Singapore undertook measures to upgrade
labor skills and retrain a large portion of its tabor force to
suit the needs of its advanced industrial economy. The
Philippines stepped up its manpower development program. This included training in skills and apprenticeship
schemes. indonesia increased the construction of new
primary and secondary schools, additional classrooms and
houses for teachers. In Pakistan, emphasis was placed on
free provision of functional literacy education, expansion
of universities and manpower and skills training. Papua
New Guinea embarked on a priority project to improve and
expand technical education and apprentice training.

Several DMCs continued to emphasize family planning.
Bangladesh undertook a special project with the objective
of encouraging voluntary sterilization by over a million
couples by 1984. India increased its budgetary atlocation
for population programs by 35 per cent in FY 1983.
Singapore, which has successfully brought down its
population growth, used taxation and monetary measures
to discourage large families.

DMCs continued their efforts to accelerate the development of rural areas and improve the status of low-income
groups. Several DMCs took special measures in this regard.
Bangladesh launched a new experiment in decentralization
of development planning and administration by posting its
civil servants to rural administrative centers (thanas) where
they were required to work under the supervision of elected
representatives of ihe locality. A total of 55 such “model”
thanas were inaugurated during 1982. Indonesia embarked
on agricultural expansion plans geared to help small
farmers, including those in the remote regions of Sumatra
and Kalimantan. The Philippines doubled the initial provision of P14 billion ($117 million) for its Nationa! Livelihood
Program (known as ‘‘Kilusang Kabuhayan at Kauniaran” or
"KKK”), Launched in 1981, the program envisages popular
mobilization of productive and entrepreneurial energies at
the grassroots level.

Regional Cooperation

Efforts toward increasing regional cooperation continued in 1982. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations
{ASEAN) achieved progress in the areas of preferential
trading arrangements and the estabiishment of industrial
joint ventures in the private sector. As a result of a decision
taken at the Twelfth ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting

(AEM) in January 1982, the product-by-product approach to
tariff liberalization was dropped in favor af a modified
across-tne-board approach to tariff cutting subject to certain exclusions. The ceiling of total import value of $1
million on items subject to automatic 20-25 per cent margin
of preferences in intra-ASEAN trade, approved in January
1982, was increased to $2.5 million in May 1982 and to $10
million in November 1982.

Under the Basic Agreernent of ASEAN Industriai Joint
Ventures, any manufacture produced by a private venture
owned by investors from two or more ASEAN countrias wili
be accorded a 50 per cent tariff cut if at least two ASEAN
countries agree to extend this tariff preference. After a
three-year period, the product will be given preferential
tariff treatment by ali ASEAN member couniries. This joint
venture agreement is expected to be more flexibie than the
complementation scheme’ which needs the agreement of
all five ASEAN members for any tariff cut.

South Pacific countries continued to pursue cooperative
undertakings through the South Pacific Bureau for
Economic Cooperation and tne South Pacific Commission,
the major regional organizations of this subregion.

Agreement was reached at the Thirteenth South Pacific
Forum Meeting in August 1982 to improve the financial
status of the Pacific Forum Line. An amount of $12.6
million from members was pledged for this purpose as well
as to enable the Line to qualify for a loan of ECU 5 million
equivalent from the European Investment Bank for conlainer purchases. The members aiso agreed to study the
region’s air transport system.

At the Twenty-Second South Pacific Conference in October 1982, various regional projects were considered by
the South Pacific Commission. A decision was reached to
continue the second phase of the South Pacific Regional
Environment Program, subject to financial support from
member governments. This would include formulation of a
strategy on nuclear waste disposal by developed countries
in the region, conservation of coastal ecosystems and
monitoring of marine pollution,

At their Third Meeting held in August 1982, Foreign
Secretaries of South Asian countries agreed to hold a
ministerial meeting on South Asian regional cooperation in
1983. The meeting would consider areas such as com:
munications, rural development, agriculture, technology
transfer, meteorology and healt and population activities.
A trend of growing bilateral cooperation among South
Asian countries was also noted. A bilateral agreement was
conciuded in 1982 between Bangladesh and Nepal to set up
a jute factory, a pulp and paper plant and a fertilizer plant in
Nepal. India agreed to purchase from Bangladesh urea,
newsprint and bitumen and to extend a credit of $60 million
to Bangiadesh for purchase of capital goods from it.

International Cooperation

There were several important developments in international trade and finance relevant to DMCs during the year.
Loan commitments of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) to OMCs (the

Bangladesh

During Fiscal Year (FY) 1982 (ended in June),
Bangiadesh’s GDP is estimated to have grown by 0.9 per
cent compared with 5.8 per cent in the preceding year. The
value-added in agriculture declined by 1.9 per cent as a
result of prolonged drought. The value-added in the
manufacturing and services sectors increased at a much
slower pace because of shortages in domestic credit, raw
materials and imported inputs as well as low domestic and
export demand.

The crop failure and the large deficit-financed public expenditures in FY 1982 contributed to an increase in consumer prices of 12.8 per cent in 1982, as against 12 per cent
in 1981.

The balance-of-payments situation in 1982 became very
precarious. Import capacity was severely constrained by a
decline in export receipts and a reduction in aid
disbursements, particularly that of commodity assistance.
The terms of trade deteriorated by 14.8 per cent in 1981 and
again by 14.5 per cent in 1982. In view of the abnormat
shortfall in export receipts, the country received an ailocation of SDRE0 million from the IMF Compensatory Financing Facility. Another SDR71 million was received from the
same Facility to meet the cost of cereal imports.

Public sector resources from tax revenues and contributions of public enterprises registered substantlal shortfalls
compared with the budget estimates. The decline in imports of dutiable items affected Government revenues
which depended heavily on import duties. Consequently,
the Government took steps in the budget for FY 1983 to effect economies in both the recurrent and investment
expenditure, while maintaining development outlays in
priority sectors such as energy and food production.
Several measures were taken during 1982 to improve
economic managemeni. Restraints were imposed on expansion of credit to contain increases in domestic prices.
In addition to the food assistance provided by the international aid community, emergency imports of foodgrains
were arranged from Burma and India. Subsidies on food,
fertilizer, gasoline and utilities were reduced substantially.
Simultaneously, procurement prices of rice and wheat were
raised to maintain incentives for farmers. A law was
enacted to promote foreign private investment. Denationalization of some factofies formerly owned by
Bangladesh nationals was announced and the first private
jocal bank was inaugurated. These measures were expected to help promote the growth of the private sector and
increase domestic savings which, at about 4 per cent of
GDP, is one of the lowest among DMCs.

The economy of Bangladesh continued to face several
development problems in 1982. The industrial sector,
dominated by public enterprises, required structural adjustments and productivity improvements. There were large
imbalances between supply and demand for food and
energy, between the levels of imports and exports, between
domestic resource mobilization and investment requirements for minimal necessary growth in per capita income, and between the increase in the labor force and
growth of employment opportunities. The drain on limited
foreign exchange resources caused by imports of energy
and food to meet the requirements of a rapidly increasing

population resiricted the nation’s ability to finance imports
for development purposes.

The Government's development plans and policies were
aimed at correcting structural imbalances. Self-sufficiency
in food and energy, reduction in population growth rate, improved economic management of the public sector and
growth of the private sector were given high priority.
Various measures were also taken to promote exports as a
step towards increased self-reliance.

Burma

GDP growth in Burma during FY 1983 (ending in March) is
estimated at 7.1 per cent which is significantly higher than
the growth of 6.7 per cent recorded in the preceding year.
The somewhat lower growth in manufacturing and mining
was more than offset by higher growth in agricultural production. Although drought conditions prevailed in upper
Burma, agriculturai production in the rest of the country increased significantly following widespread use of highyielding varieties of rice and contributed to a much higher
overall agricultural sector growth. Also, growth rates of the
construction and services sectors were higher than in 1981.

Various official price indices have indicated increases in
prices of between 1 and 5 per cent in recent years. Consumer prices went up by 4.9 per cent in 1982. This modest
increase was due to arise in productivity, particularly in the
agriculture sector, and increased availability of essential
commodities, while expansion of the monetized sector absorbed some of the increase in money supply.

Budget estimates for FY 1983 anticipate an increase of 8
per cent, both in current revenues and expenditures of the
Government, teaving a surplus of K1,130 million ($145
million) — about one-fifth of total revenues — for financing
the estimated capital expenditure of about K1,900 million
($243 million). The remaining K770 million {$98 million) was
expected to be financed through capital receipts of K170
million ($22 million) and domestic and external borrowing.
The Government’s capital expenditure for FY 1983
represents an increase of about 38 per cent over the
previous year.

Burma's trade deficit fell marginally from $360 mitiion in
FY 1981 to $357 million in FY 1982. Exports increased by 13
per cent from $514 million in FY 1981 to $582 million in FY
1982, while imports increased by 7.4 per cent from $874
million in FY 1981 to $939 million in FY 1982.

In April, Burma embarked upon 3 new four-year plan. The
plan generally aims at furthering the objectives of the
twenty-year plan, started in FY 1975, which were: increasing per capita income, transforming the base of the
economic structure from agriculture to agro-based industries, and increasing the share of the state sector in the
net output. Increasing labor productivity and exports were
other targets. In the investment program of the Government
for FY 1983, the share of the processing and manufacturing
sector was 37.1 per cent of the total outlay. The share of
agriculture was 18.4 per cent; mining, 11.5 per cent; and
iransport and communications, 10.2 per cent.

Republic of China

The growth of GDP of the Republic of China in 1982 was
around 3 per cent, far below the planned target of 7.5 per
cent. The primary factor contributing to this low growth
rate was a 1.4 per cent reduction in exports in 1982 as
against a growth of 13 per cent in 1981. Government con
19sumption increased moderately by 5 per cent, refiecting its
cautious approach toward reflating the domestic economy.
Gross flxed capital formation dectined by 2 per cent, while
industrtal production increased by only about 1 per cent, as
the rapid rates of growth In mining and construction
achieved In 1981 slowed down, However, the service sector
~~ especiaily.banking and insurance — and real estate
fared better.

Inflationary pressures continued to abate significantly
from the high levels of 1980, Consumer prices increased by
only 4 per cent in 1982 as against 16.3 per cent in 1981 and
18 per cent in 1980. Depressed domestic demand and
declining prices of many imported goods and raw materials
were the principal factors responsible for this trend.

The trade surpius Increased from $2 bililon In 1981 to $2.8
billion in 1982 as imports declined more than exports. The
drop in Imports was Indicatlve of the depressed situation in
the manufacturing sector and low levels of new investment,
since about 99 per cent of total commodity Imports consisted of capital goods and raw ojaterlals needed for industrial production.

The Government recently enacted several measures to
stimulate private investment. These Included lowering of interest rates, providing tax credits and increasing funds to
small and medium-sized industries. tn addition, emphasis
was placed on new poilotes designed to expedite the merging of Smali and medium-sized industries Into larger, more
efficient units and developing high technology industrles
such as sophisticated electronics, computer sofiware and
machinery. .

Fijt

The GDP of Fijl was estimated to have grown at a rate of
0.4 per cent In real terms in 1982 as against 6.3 per cent In
1987. The slowdown was due to a substantial deciine In the
production of sugar, flsh and timber. The inflation rate continued to decelerate from 14.5 per cent in 1980 to 11.2 per
cent in 1981 and 7 per cent in 1982, mainly because of the
stable prices of Imported goods such as fue! and foodstuff.

Exports contlnued to deciine from $374 milllon In 1980 to
$307 milllon In 1981 and $305 million in 1982. Low prices of
principal export commodities (sugar, copra, fish and
lumber} adversely affected the country’s export earnings.
Earnings from tourism, however, grew by between 75 and
20 per cent In 1982. In order to restraln rapidly growlng imports, the Government-introduced high Import dutles, mainly on fuxury items, resulting in a substantial reduction in imports from $516 million in 1981 to $643 milllon in 1982. The
trade deficit, therefore, narrowed from $309 million In 1984
to $238 million in 1982.

Tax revenues declined mainly because of lower revenue
collections from import duties. The Government, therefore,
found it necessary to impose a 15 per cent cut in budgetary
expenditure.

Hong Kong

Hong Kong's GDP increased by 2.4 per cent in 1982,
marking a sharp drop from the double-digit growth of the
preceding years. Aimost all major sectors felt the impact of
worldwide recession in view of the highly open and exportoriented nature of the economy. Consumption expenditure
increased only by 1.7 per cent in 1982, after 12.2 per cent
growth in 1981 and 13 per cent growth a year earlier. Overall
investment showed no growth compared with an increase
of 13 per cent in 1981. Most of the impetus to praduction

and investment was provided by Government expenditure
which was mainly on construction activity. Expenditure increased by about 17 per cent in real terms.

The slackness in demand had some moderating influence on inflation. The increase in consumer prices during the year was 10.6 per cent, as against 15.4 per cent in
1981. Unemployment in manufacturing industries, especially in textiles, increased but was offset to some extent by
growth in employment in finance, banking and other service sectors.

The overall visible trade gap narrowed slightly in 1982.
While exports decreased by aimost $1 billion in 1982, imports fell even more as a result of weak demand in re-export
industries and a general slowdown in economic activities.

Revenues from land sales had increased sharply since
FY 1978 (ended in March) because of a continuous rise in
land prices. Consequently, ihe Government was able to
finance expanding public investment without raising taxes.
Low taxation rates stimulated investment in the private
sector, while the Government pursued poticies aimed at
making Hong Kong a major financial and industrial center.
The Government also played a key role in the provision of
infrastructure facilities. The FY 1983 budget envisaged
financlng of public investments mosily with revenues derived from land sales, which were estimated to yield 32 per
cent of the total revenues, However, the collapse of the
Property boom in 1982 caused a major setback in the
realization of this objective.

India

The growth rate of India’s GDP was expected to decline
during FY 1983 (ending In March) to about 2 per cent compared with 5.2 per cent In FY 1982, The lower growth in FY
1983 was caused principally by reduced agricultural productlon under the Impact of widespread drought and an irregular monsoon. Production of manufactured goods increased at a slower rate because of flagging export demand and prolonged labor unrest in the textile Industry.

Consumer prices were expected to Increase by about 8.1
per cent in FY 1983, considerably below the 13.1 per cent
rise in FY 1982, despite a substantial reduction in
agricultura! output. The Government’s policy of setective
credit controls and increasing the import of goods in short
supply helped restrain the increase in consumer prices.

The balance-of-payments position during 1982 remained
difficult. Exports were adversely affected by tow demand in
industrial countries and falling prices for its primary commodities and registered only modest growth from the
depressed fevel of 1981. At the same time, India imported a
substantial quantity of foodgrains to augment its buffer
stock, taking advantage of tow foodgrain prices. imports
also Increased as a result of a lIberalization of import
policy. The country was able to reduce its external deficit
somewhat below the high level of 1981 by trimming its oil
imports by about 2 million tons. External assistance — part
of the proceeds of a iarge IMF loan contracted in 1981 —
and some of the country’s foreign exchange reserves were
used to finance the large trade deficit.

Even though India depended on imports for only about 20
per cent of its commercial energy, the energy import bill
pre-empied nearly three-fourths of its export receipts. Action to remedy the situation was taken in 1982 through
policy measures designed to promote the development of
domestic energy sources. Crude off production was
estimated to have increased from 15 million tons in 1981 to20 miltion tons in 1982, while coal production increased
from 123 million tons to 132 million tons.

India nas for a long time pursued a policy of importsubstitution. Some of its manufactured products nave
become competitive in international markets. However, the
total export of such products remains small in relation to
the country's large GDP and import requirements. In recent
years the Government introduced policies to promote exports, particularly of manufactured goods, and to allow
liberal imports by industrial users to help in the fuller
utilization of productive capacity. The Government also increased incentives to the private sector to invest in industry. It also took steps to attract foreign private investors
by providing lideral fiscal concessions and atiractive terms
of repatriation of profits and capital. 
For a low-income country, india has maintained a high
level of investment of around 24 per cent of GDP, financed
mostly from domestic resources. However, the overall
growth rate was generally low. This, as was demonstrated
in 1982, was partly due to the vulnerability of the !arge agricultural sector to adverse weather conditions and partly to
low productivity of industrial investment. To overcome
these problems, the Government placed greater emphasis
on expansion of the irrigated area, increased use of fertilizer and efficiency in the utilization of water and other inputs by farmers. In the industrial sector, the Government
provided various incentives for increasing the productivity
of existing enterprises in both the public and private sectors, It also reduced tariff protection given to several
domestic industries with a view to making them more efficient and competitive.

indonesia

Indonesia’s GDP in 1982 is estimated to have increased
by about 4.5 per cent compared with an increase of 7.6 per
cent in the previous year. Agricultural output fell short of
the initial forecast because of drought conditions. Rice production is estimated to have gone up by only 3.14 percent as
against 11 per cent in 1981. Growin in non-rice agriculiure
was also sluggish in 1982. The mining sector’s contribution
to GDP was affected by weak demand for petroleum; its
output fell below the quota authorized by OPEC. However,
LNG production was higher than in the previous year.
Manufaciuring sector output decelerated, while that of construction, transport and utilities was maintained by public
sector investment.

The consumer price index in 1982 registered an increase
of 9.7 per cent compared with 7.1 per cent in 1981, in spite
of major upward adjustments in the prices of petroleum
products early in the year.

Since over two-thirds of budgetary revenues is derived
from oil and oil products, the financial position of the
Government became difficult during the year. The Government reduced the use of dudgetary resources for subsidizing food and fuel prices. The prices of wheat and sugar
were raised in 1981 and the prices of petroleum products
were increased by over 60 per cent in January 1982.

Indonesia’s external resource situation deteriorated in
4982 and the country is estimated to have incurred a current account deficit of $5.5 billion compared with a deficit
of $1.2 billion in the previous year. Revenues from both oil
and non- oil exports declined. Indonesia borrowed substantial amounts from foreign sources and drew upon its
reserves to meet ihe current account deiicit.

in January 1982 the Government introduced a number of

measures to promote exports. These Inciuded reduction in
interest rates on export credit, establishment of export insurance and guarantee facilities and simplification of
customs clearance procedures. A counter-purchase policy
was introduced which required foreign suppliers of certain
goods to the Government to import goods of equivalent
value or find other foreign buyers for the purpose.

In the light of the deteriorating balance-of-payments
situation, Indonesia tightened controls over 126 import
items. While these measures imposed no outright limitation on total imports, they were expected to slow down the

growth of imports. A sixfold increase in the tax on overseas”

travel was introduced. A policy measure requiring shipment
of Government cargoes in Indonesian vessels was also expecied to provide some relief to the balance-of- payments
situation.

The temporary deterioration in ihe external resource
situation gave added impetus to Government efforis to
diversify the production structure and to improve domestic
resource mobilization. At the same time, Government efforts to promote exports, reduce subsidies and improve
productive efficiency in various sectors would have to be intensified.

Republic of Korea

The Republic of Korea’s GDP increased by about 6 per
cent in 1982, compared with 7.1 per cent growth in 1981 and
2 goal of 7 per cent in the Government's Economic Management Plan. The growth rates of agriculture and manufacturing sectors were 5,5 per cent and 3.1 per cent, respectively.
The increase in GDP was sustained by a strong recovery of
investment spending during the year, mostly.in the housing
industry. The annual number of permits for house construction increased by 40 per cent (by the end of September). The
Government’s construction sector was also active and
there was some recovery in investment by small and
medium-sized industries.

The deceleration in inflation, which started during 1980,
continued during the year. Consumer prices rose by about
7.3 per cent during 1982 compared with an increase of 21.3
per cent in 1981. Most of this reduction in inflation reflected
reduced prices of many imported raw materials, continued
stability in oil and food prices and only moderate increases
in wages. Another significant factor that promoted price
stability in the economy was the strength of the won. ft remained strong against all major currencies, other than the
US doilar against which it declined by 7 per cent.

AS a result of the general sluggisnness of demand in export markets, commodity exports increased by only 2.4 per
cent compared with 21.4 per cent in 1981. Commodity imports, however, registered a decline of 7 per cent. As the
deficit in the service account was also reduced, the current
account deficit narrowed from $4.4 billion in 1981 to about
$2 billion in 1982. The improvement in the balance of
payments stemmed mainly from a rise in earnings from
overseas construction projects, reduced imports of
foodgrains and petroleum and successful implementation
of import substitution measures in some heavy and
chemicai industries.

During the year, the Government introduced fresh policy
measures to stimulate economic activity and liberalize the
financia! sector. Under a policy package announced in
June, interest rates were reduced by 4 percentage points on
both loans and deposits to 10 per cent and 8 per cent,

21respectively. These rates will apply to al! deposits and
loans, thereby eliminating for the first time the complex
system of varying interest rates for different types of loans
and deposlis. in addition, the corporate tax rate was reduced from a varying rate, ranging from 33 per cent to 38
per cent, to a uniform rate of 20 per cent, and the highest
marginal rate of individual income-tax was cut from 76.5
per cent to 50 per cent, effective from 1983. Tax credits
were given to encourage equity investment by business.
Tax concessions were provided on purchase of cars and
color television sets to stimulate demand and heip the
indusiries.

The Government also announced a three-pronged reform
of the financial market. First, it decided to step up its
banking I!beralization program, gradually turning over
Government-controlled commercial banks to the private
sector. Second, measures were taken to enlarge the shortterm money market by including smaller secondary bank{ng Institutions such as securities and mutual savings companles, Finally, the tax and banking laws were to be revised
80 as to bring within the tax net loans provided by the curb
(informal) market.

The new economic incentives and financlal reforms are
expected to improve the growth performance of the
economy. However, given the heavy weightage of exports in
GDP, recovery of export demand would be crucial to the
revival of its growth momentum.

Malaysia

Malaysia's GDP increased by 3.9 per cent in 1982, Its
lowest rate of growth since 1975. The manufacturing sector
grew by 1.9 per cent, agriculture by 6.7 per cent and mining
by 4.6 per cent. A reflationary public sector budget,
together with revenue shortfalls, produced a large deficit
that was only marginally smaller than the large deficit of
1981. The Government resorted to heavy external borrowing
to maintain investment. However, revenue collections
dwindled progressively and planned Government expenditure had to be scaled down.

Aside from an austere budget for 1983, the Government
announced a number of revenue measures to increase
taxes on cars, cigarettes, liquor and other luxury items.

Inflation slackened to 5.8 per cent from 9.7 per cent in
1981, partly as a result of tight money and credit conditlons. Other coniributory factors were removal of import
dutles on selected commodities, depressed prices of many
domestic and imported goods and stabitizing measures
adopted by the Government.

The volume and prices of a broad range of major export
commodities, including rubber and tin, stagnated or fell further In 1982. However, Malaysia, which is not a member of
OPEC, was able to increase oil shlpments. The country aiso
completed the necessary infrastructure for exporting LNG
from its Bintulu plant in Sarawak. This Is expected to aug:
meni export earnings from early 1983.

The trade account in 1982 registered a large deficit of
about $1.1 billion compared with a deficit of $12 mililon In
4984. Large capital inflows, notably substantial external
borrowings and syndicated credits and bonds, reduced the
balance-of-payments gap to about $264 million, which was
lower than in 1981. Malaysia also drew from the IMF compensatory and bufferstock financing facilities during the
year. In spite of heavy external borrowings on commercial
terms, the external public debt-service ratio remained at a
modest level of 3.1 per cent in 7981.

The Malaysian ringgit depreciated by 4 per cent against
the US dollar but appreciated against most other currencies. Continued low inflation rates, compared with industrial countries, have tended to enhance Malaysia's competitive position in recent years.

The shortage of budgetary resources in the face of growing development needs, which became a serious problem
for the Government in 1982, is likely to persist for some
time. The Government is, therefore, likely to face a difficult
choice between maintaining overall development activity
and continuing the subsidies and price supports previously
provided through the budget.

Nepal

Nepai’s GDP grew by 3.8 per cent in FY 1982 {ended in
July) compared with 5.6 per cent in the previous year.
However, the domestic inflation rate fell to 10.4 per cent in
FY 1982 trom 13.4 per ceni In the previous year,

During the later part of 1982, a severe droughi seriously
affected agricultural production, particularly food output.
The Government secured rice assistance from some coun:

.trles in the reglon and requested emergency food

ass|stance from the international aid community.

The domestic savings rate in Nepal !s tow, constituting
only 8 per cent of GDP. About two-fifths of its total investment Is financed by externai assistance. The rote of exter
nal assistance Is particularly large in the public sector in
which it finances nearly two-thirds of total development expenditure, with the budgetary resources providing the remalning one-third.

Nepal's exports during 1982 decilned. Export of rice was
banned due to drought. An earller ban on the clearing of
forests affected the export of timber. Tourism, which has
been a dynamic source of foreign exchange earnings for
Nepal in recent years, was aiso adversely affected by the
world recession. The current account deficit of Nepal increased In FY 1982 and stood at $31 million. The overall
balance of payments, however, recorded a $38 million
surplus In the same period because of a fairly large inflow
of externat assistance.

The Government Inltiated a special Economic Program in
early 1982 to focus attention on the components of the
Sixth Pian which wiil be of immédiate benefit to small
farmers, small-scale manufacturers and the poorer
segments of society. The Program also aimed at limiting
the role of Government corporations and mobllizing the
energles of the private sector. The Industrlal Enterprises
Act and the Trade Policy of 1982 were promulgated to promote private industrial investments and expand exports.

Despite sustained efforts of the Government to mobilize
resources and improve the performance of the economy,
the country continues to suffer from several constraints on
Hs economic development, The major obstacles include an
inadequate institutional base, low productivity, paucity of
managerial and technical skills, and relatively limited
natural resources. These handicaps have been compound:
ed by the ecological deterloration of land through deforestation and soll eroston.

The Government is taking steps to ralse agricultural productivity, make greater use of abundant hydropower
resources and promote smali-scale resource-based jndustries. However, progress in this regard has been slow in
view of Nepal's various constraints. This can only be improved through greater domestic efforts coupled with continued and expanded external assistance.Pakistan

Pakistan registered a GDP growth of 6.2 per cent during
FY 1982 (ended in June} compared with 6.1 per cent in FY
4981. Value-added in manufacturing increased by 12.4 per
cent and in agriculture by 2.5 per cent. In the Energy sector,
the output of gas, coal and crude oil increased. The
economy has been consistently registering a high-growth
performance since FY 1978. Factors contributing to the
resilience of the economy included a continuous period of
good weather and large annual increases in workers’ remittances which largely offset the impact of higher oil prices.
The Government took steps to improve productivity, curtail
public sector expansion and create an environment conducive to the recovery of the private sector. At the same
time, demand management policies helped to reduce the
relative size of budgetary deficits, Government borrowing
from banks and the rate of monetary expansion.

Fiscal and monetary policies during the year were restrictive. Restraints on Government borrowing, together with
higher domestic output. helped reduce the inflation rate to
about 9.6 per cent in FY 1982 compared with 11 per cent in

- FY 1981. By the end of 1982, the inflation rate had dropped

to an annual rate of about 5 per cent.

The export sector was depressed, marking a sharp break
from the recent trend. Decline in demand for Pakistan's
manufactured exports —— textiles, cotton yarn and carpets
— and the low prices for its primary commodity exports —
rice and cotton — reduced its export earnings in FY 1982 by
about 18 per cent compared with the level of FY 1981. The
decline in export receipts was accompanied by a slowdown
in the growth of remittances from Pakistanis working
abroad. Despite continued access to the IMF’s Extended
Fund Facility, a larger-than-expected drawdown of Pakistan’s international reserves was necessary to fill the
balance-of-payments gap during the year.

The budget for FY 1982 did not provide for a substantial
increase in tax rates. Instead, growth in tax revenue was expected from higher receipts from import duties on a larger
volume of expected imports and further improvements in
tax administration. On the expenditure side, a major attempt was made to reduce subsidies on wheat, cement and
petroleum products.

The actual budgetary situation was tighter than initially
anticipated. The increase in receipts from import duties
failed to materialize as import volume was lower than anticipated, while a sharp dectine in exports led to a large
shortfall in export duty collections, The current budget
surplus was reduced from an estimated Rs7.3 billion ($616
million) to Rs3.8 billion {8321 million). In order to hold down
deficit financing within the limits prescribed by monetary
Policy, the Government implemented across-the-board cuts
in budgetary allocations, which ted to a drastic reduction in
development expenditure for the year.

Despite its high growth rates of GDP in recent years, the
country faced several domestic and external problems.
Domestic savings contributed less than one-third of investment expenditure, whlie external sources provided the rest
of the requirement. Pakistan's export earnings met only
half of its import bili and its debt-servicing obligations have
Temained high. Continued efforts would, therefore, be required to increase domestic savings, enhance productivity
in both agriculture and industry, utilize the scope for efficient import substitution, expand domestic sources of
eneray and promote exports.

Papua New Guinea

Papua New Guinea's GDP recorded no growth in 1982. As
the aggregate growth in the preceding two years was
negligible, per capita income steadily declined over the
three-year period. Production and prices of important
minerals (mainly comprising copper and gold) also declined. On the whole, agricultural production was stable.

The increase in consumer prices during 1982 was 5.9 per
cent, substantially below the increase of 9.9 per cent in the
preceding year.

Government expenditure was estimated to have declined
in real terms in 1982, with further downward adjustment
budgeted for 1983, These adjustments became necessary
as 2 result of a reduction in Government revenues, While
overall current and investment expenditures were curtailed,
adequate provision was made to ensure sustained development of the minerals and energy sectors as well as major
agricultural projects and effect general improvements in
the support services designed to raise the productivity of
the smallholder sector.

Due to a fali in the prices of principal export commodities, export earnings were considerably lower in 1982
than in 1981. Imports increased, but at a somewhat lower
rate than in 1981. The trade deficit was a record $462
million in 1982, significantly above the deficit of $288
million in 1981.

Philippines

According to provisional official estimates, GDP of the
Philippines grew by 3 per cent during 1982, which was less
than the low rate of 3.8 per cent recorded in 1981. Production in agriculture, fisheries and forestry increased by
3.5 per cent and there was a 4.8 per cent growth in rice
production . °

‘industrial growth decelerated to 2.7 per cent from 4.5 per
cent in the previous year, as mining output fell by 1.5 per
cent. Construction, encouraged by Government spending,
grew by 4.4 per cent.

Consumer prices increased by 10.2 per cent compared
with 12,4 per cent in 1981.

Merchandise export earnings declined substantially due
to weak foreign demand and low prices for the country’s
major exports — coconut products, sugar and copper. imports also decreased, but at a slower rate than exports.
Reduced foreign demand, depressed commodity prices and
high interest payments on foreign loans contributed to a
larger current account deficit, despite the mitigating effect
of increased remittances by overseas workers. In ihe
course of the year the peso depreciated by 7.6 per cent
against the US dollar, but remained firm against other major currencies.

The Government continued the process of interest rate
deregulation, which was started in 1981, and initiated
several fiscal reforms including a shift to gross taxation of
salaries and wages. These measures were intended to improve domestic resource mobilization. With the World
Bank's structural adjustment assistance, rationalization of
the textile and cement industries commenced in 1982. !mport liberalization continued as scheduled for the period
4981-1985. An additional 600 items were removed from the
fist of banned items and allowed to be imported, subject to
the prescribed import duties and taxes. However, early in
4983 an additional ad valorem tax of 3 per cent and advance
import deposit requirements were imposed to slow down

23|

imports. At the same time, the Government lifted the tax on
copra and modified restrictlons on logging with a view to
promoting exports. A growing fiscal deficit came under the
Scruilny of {MF in the course of the country’s negotiations
for a standby credit facility and lad to limitations on public
expenditure projected for 1983,

A slowdown in foreign borrowing and a self-imposed $2.4
bition celting on approvals for 1982 adopted by the Central
Bank, as well as jower foreign investment coupled with
larger amortization payments, reduced the level of net longterm capital inflow during 1982.

A heavier debt-service burden was associated with low
export demand and a large decline in the prices of primary
exports. The debt-service ratio, as defined according to national law, was almost 20 per cent in 1982. The external
resource situation appears to have become a serious conStraint on the pursult of the country’s high-growth strategy
to alleviate poverty and ameliorate under-employment in
agriculture and industry.

Singapore

Singapore achieved a GDP growth rate of 6.3 per cent in
1982 compared with an increase of 9.9 per cent in 1981, in
the manufacturing sector, which accounted for nearly 25
per cent of GDP, output declined by 5.6 per cent compared
with a growth of 9.8 per cent In 1981. The construction sector, where the Government piays a significant rofe, grew by
as much as 36 per cent. Value-added in transport and communications increased by 11 per cent and in financial and
business sectors by about 14 per cent.

The Government increased Its development outlays, partly to offset inadequate private Investment. Pubtic housing
construction was accelerated through the provision of tax
incentives and low-cost financing.

The rate of inflation during 1982 felt to 3.9 per cent from
8.2 per cent in 1981. This deceleration was mainly attributable to a general weakenIng in import prices,
especially essential commodities.

Recelpts from merchandlse exports declined by 0.9 per
cent while Imports rose by 2.1 per cent. The decline in exports was targely attributable to weak foreign demand,
diminished competitive edge due to steep wage increases
during the past three years and continued firmness of the
Singapore dollar. The deficit in the balance of trade widened from $6.6 billion in 1981 to $7.4 billion in 1982.
However, the surplus in the service account from tourism
and other services more than offset the trade deficit. This
together with large capital Inflows improved the overall
balance-of-paymenits surplus.

The general policy of the Government has been to accelerate the transition to a skill-intensive, high-technology
economy. The development of the manufacturing and service industries, which utllize higher skllis and generate
larger value-added per unit of output, continued to recelve
high priority. Maintenance of wage Increases in line with
productlvity gains was also stressed. In addition, efforts
were continued to upgrade tabor skilis and retrain workers.

In view of its small domestic market, Singapore has pursued a policy of outward orientation and vigorous trade
promotion. In 1982, it was announced that a Trade Development Board would be set up in 1983 to strengthen export
promotion.

Despite some deceleration in economic activity in 1982,
ihe economy continued to be dynamic and adaptabie. Recent Government initiatives toward promotion of

technological sophistication, skill upgrading and research
and development are expected to enhance the country's
flexibility in deating with a rapidly changing external
environment.

Solomon islands

The GDP of Solomon Islands is estimated to have declined by about 2.3 per cent in 1982 mainly because of
reduced domestic production and low demand for its exports. However, the country’s inflation rate decreased from
16 per cent in 1981 to about 13 per cent in 1982, mostly asa
result of lower Import prices of fue! and foodstuffs.

The country's exports decreased from $65 million in 1987
to $58 miltion in 1982, Fish — one of its major export Items
— suffered a subsiantlal decilne. Exports of timber and
palm oi! increased but could not fully offset the loss. The
value of copra and cocoa exports remained at-about the
same level as in 1981.

Notwithstanding the decrease in exports, the trade
deficit narrowed signlflcantly from $10 million in 1981 to $3
million in 1982. This was because imports of fuel,
machinery and transport vehicles were substantially reduced, decreasing overall Imports by 19 per cent, from $75
million in 1984 to an estimated $61 million in 1982. As a
result of higher external assistance, the overall balance of
payments turned from a deflcit in 1981 to a modest surplus
In 1982,

Srl Lanka

Sri Lanka’s GDP growth In 1982 was about 5 per cent
compared with an Increase of 5.4 per cent in the preceding
year. Growth of agricultural production dectined as a result
of drought. The plantation sector was Particularly affected.
Production increases of processing industries were affected by lower output from the plantation sector, Growth
in the services sector was also lower with banking,
transport and tourism remaining stagnant. The manufacturing sector, however, recorded a higher growth rate of 9.1
per cent in 1982 compared wlth 5.2 per cent In 1981.

The budget deficlt widened as more expenditure was Incurred on salaries of Government. emptoyees and on
drought-reilef measures, while Government revenue did not
show much improvement. Drought-rellef expenditure was
estimated at Rs50-60 million ($2-3 million) a month, and the
increase in the Government's payroll In 1982 was considerably more than that initially budgeted.

In 1982, the trade deficit increased to $936 million from
$819 million in 1981. Despite ihe cutbacks of non-essential
imports, the import bill was higher than in 1981, while exports registered a dectine of about 3.6 per cent from the
level of 1987.

As part of a short-term stabilization measure, the Government deferred a planned increase in the value of food
Stamps and called for reduced expenditures by its
ministries. The Central Bank took steps to reduce the excess liquidity of commercial banks. As a result, consumer
prices increased by 11 per cent in 1982 compared with 18
per cent in 1981.

In view of the shortage of investible resources, the
Government placed emphasis on the Implementation of
selected, high-priority projects, inciuding the Accelerated
Mahaweli Project, but it drastically reduced expenditure on
several other sectors, including the housing Program.
Despite these measures, the Government found it
necessary to raise a $100 milllion Eurodoliar loan in June to
help finance the reduced outlay.Thailand

Thailand’s GDP grew by 4.5 per cent in 1982 compared
with 7.0 per cent in the previous year. Agricultural output
stagnated after a iarge increase in 1981, while industriai
production increased modestly. As the year progressed,
construction activity also became sluggish.

Inflation, as reflected in consumer prices, eased to 5.2
per cent from 12.7 per cent in 1981.

Exports of several commodities grew in volume during
the year because of good agricultural production in 1981.
The high volume of exports more than offset the adverse
terms of trade. However, total earnings from exports and
the value of imports declined. The trade deficit narrowed to
$1.8 billion in 1982 from $3 billion in 1981.

Depressed commodity prices and shortfalls in tax collections prompted the Government to take a number of
measures. Various short-term measures were adopted to
improve public finances as the country continued to pursue
a medium-term strategy of structural adjustment. Some of
these, including improvements in tax administration and a
40 per cent surcharge on certain import taxes, are fully
compatible with the program of long-term reforms.
Thailand's budget for FY 1983 (ending September) envisages a nominal increase of about 10 per cent in expenditure. The Government began various tax revisions, covering personal and corporate income-tax and property sales
tax and initiated an overhaul of the system of protection by
narrowing the range of nominal tariff rates.

During FY 1982 the Government took several measures to
promote exports. These include improving the support
price of paddy and reducing by 50 per cent the premium on
rice exports, removing the ban on white sugar exports,
eliminating cassava quotas and reducing export taxes on
ruober. The discovery and exploitation of significant off
shore natural gas resources and potential oil-bearing structures in the northeast part of the mainland raised hopes of
significant substitution of oil imports in the coming years,
despite some technical problems encountered in the
Erawan field in the Gulf of Thailand.

The Government found it difficult to implement various
restructuring measures needed to improve economic efficiency during 1982. High unemployment, depressed
agricultural incomes and inadequate public resources are
likely to delay vigorous implementation of economic
reforms.

Conclusion

During 1982, an adverse international environment anda
decline in agricultural production led to a considerable
slowdown in the GDP growth of DMCs. However, the overall
growth achieved during the year was much higher than in
other developing regions of the worid. This may be attributed to sound policies and pragmatic measures
adopted by DMCs in response to several adverse
developments in the international economy.

Slow economic growth, stack domestic and external demand and a fall in the prices of primary commodities considerably affected Government revenues and overall investment in practically all DMCs. This situation made it difficult
for DMCs to effect structural adjustments in their
economies. Increased external resources are, therefore,
necessary to facilitate such structural adjustments in linge
with economic realities and augment the supply of investible resources.

The Bank remained responsive to the needs of its DMCs
during 1982. Its role during the year in providing external
assistance to them is discussed in the following chapters.

Lending Operations

TOTAL LOAN approvais during the year amounted to $1,731
million compared with $1,678 million in the previous year.
Loans from ordinary capital resources (OCR) in 1982
amounted to $1,184.5 million, an increase of 3.3 per cent in
nominal terms over the corresponding figure of $1,146.7
million in 1981, while loans from Special Funds (SF),
amounting to $646.1 million, showed an increase of 2.9 per
cent in nominal terms over the 1981 figure of $530.9 million.

Bank tending (OCR and SF} increased by 3.2 per cent in
nominal terms in 1982, while over the five-year period
4978-1982 the annual increase averaged 14.3 per cent in
nominal terms. Annual growth rates should be viewed in
the context of a longer-term trend, however, and the decline
in the rate of growth in 1982 was mainly due to exceptional
factors, including adverse exchange rate changes which
resulted in a significant reduction in available ADF
resources. It was also a reflection of growing domestic
resource constraints and reductions in development expenditures by some of the Bank's developing member countries (DMCs) as they attempted to adjust to the effects of
the continuing recession in the world economy.

During the year, 57 loans for 58 projects in 13 DMGs were
approved compared with 57 loans for 54 projects in 15
DMGs in 1981. Of these, one project — the Fourth Industrial
Development Bank of Pakistan — received a blended ioan,
or, in other words, financing from both OCR and SF.

The average size of loans increased marginally from
329.4 million in 1981 to $30.4 million in 1982. While the
average size of OCR loans decreased from $38.2 million in
1981 to $37 million in 1982, the average size of SF loans increased from $19.7 million to $21.8 million over the same
period.

In 1982, about 98 per cent of SF loans went to DMCs
which had a per capita gross national product (GNP) of less
than $300 in 1980.

During the year, five DMCs received loans exclusively
from OCR: Indonesia ($371.1 million), Philippines ($253.8
million), Republic of Korea ($205.5 million), Thailand ($171.6
million} and Malaysia ($92.6 million).

Two DMCs received loans from both OCR and SF:
Pakistan, $238.1 million ($78 million from OCR and $160.4
million from SF), and Papua New Guinea, $23 million ($12
miilion from OCR and $11 million from SF).

Six DMCs received loans exclusively from SF:
Bangladesh ($223.7 million), Sri Lanka ($60.6 million), Burma ($56.2 million), Nepal ($32 million), Cook Isiands ($1.5
million) and Vanuatu {$1 million).

Funds contributed by official and commercial cofinanciers in 1982 amounted to $689 million compared with
$627-million in 1981 and substantially added to the Bank's
own assistance to its DMCs.

Over the five-year period 1978-1982, Bank assistance to
the Agriculture, Energy and Social infrastructure sectors
has recorded sharp increases, reflecting the high priority
given to these sectors by the DMCs and the Bank. Correspondingly, Bank lending to other sectors has grown at @
slower pace or has tended to decline (see graph on page 3}.

In 1982, Bank lending to the Agriculture and Agroindustry sector accounted for 35.9 per cent of total lending
compared with 32.3 per cent in 1981. In nominal terms, lending to this sector in 1982 increased by about 15 per cent.
Bank loans supported, among other things, improvements
to irrigation, drainage and flood control facilities, related
agricultural support services and feeder road networks;
agro-processing and marketing; cotton development; integrated ‘agricultural and rural development; agricultural
credit; and forestry, fisheries and livestock development. A
large loan was also approved to augment the foreign exchange resources of an agricultural development bank for
financing agro-industrial projects in the private sector.

The share of the Energy sector in total lending rose trom
28.6 per cent in 1981 to 29.7 per cent in 1982. Lending for
energy-related projects during the year covered, among other
things, development of indigenous energy resources such as
hydropower, thermal power and natural gas, rehabilitation
and expansion of power distribution and transmission
systems and extension of rural electrification.

During the year, however, there was a marked decline in
the share of lending for social infrastructure projects.
These accounted for about 10 per cent of total lending compared with about 22 per cent in 1981. This is-explained in

DF! foans and two sector loans — is estimated at $3,337
million, Direct Bank financing accounted for about 46 per
cent of the total project costs. On the basis of the Bank's
past experience, it is estimated that the total cost of the
subloan projects to be financed by the seven DFi loans will
be about $347.4 million. The projects to be financed by the
two sector loans will involve an estimated total investment
cost of $127 million.

At the end of 1982, the Bank's cumulative lending had
reached $11,501.5 million for 565 projects in 26 DMCs. of
this total, loans amounting to $7,983.9 million were from
OCR and $3,517.6 million were from SF.

In 1982, Loca! Cost Financing (LCF) amounted to $148.6
million for 19 projects in seven DMCs. Of this, $38 million
was from OCR and $110.5 million from SF, representing 3.2
per cent and 20.2 per cent, respectively, of OCR and SF
loans approved during the year. At the end of 4982, the
Bank had provided a total of $610 million in LCF.

Co-Financing

In 4982, greater emphasis was placed on co-financing of
development projects with other external sources. in view
of the increasing difficulties in mobilizing official ald, opportunities for co-financing with commercial sources were
more vigorously pursued than in the past.

During the year, a total of 25 projects involved cofinancing, with co-financiers contributing $699 million and
the Bank contributing $878 million. This compared with 23
projects co-financed in 1981 for which co-financiers provided $627 million and the Bank $827 million. The relatively
high amount of co-financing in 1982 was to a large extent
due — as was the case in the previous year — to the inclusion ot a few large projects in the Sank’s lending operations having unusually large co-financing components.
These included the Ashuganj Thermal Power Generation
Project in Bangladesh which involved co-financing of $205
million and the Telecommunications Project in Pakistan
which involved $101 million in co-financing, both from official sources.

As of the end of 1982, co-financing had been arranged for
436 Bank-assisted projects, with funds provided by cofinanciers amounting to $3,241 million and Bank financing
for these projects amounting to $3,855 million.

As in the past, much of the Bank's co-financing in 1982
was with bilateral and multilateral official sources, both in
terms of number of projects (16, compared with 19 in 1984)
and amount ($423 million, compared with $481 miflion in
4981). However, the share of official sources in the total

; amount of co-financing dropped from 77 per cent in 1981 to
61 per cent in 1982, Five member countries — Canada,
Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Sweden and
Switzerland — provided $136.8 million, and Kuwait provided $46.5 million in co-financing with the Bank. Multilateral
sources, comprising the European Economic Community
(EEC), International Fund for Agricultural Development
(IFAD), OPEC Fund for International Development, United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World
Bank, including the International Development Association
(IDA), contributed $240 million.

Co-financing with commercial sources increased sharply
in 1982, totalling $260.6 mittion in respect of nine projects
and accounting for 37 per cent of all co-financing during
the year. This compared with commercial co-financing of

Co-financing with export credit sources, however, was
limited to $15 million for a single project, mainly due to the
absence of suitable projects in the Bank’s lending pipeline
for the year.

In March 1982, a Co-Financing Unit was created in the
Country Department to stimulate the interest of, and to
serve as @ focal contact point for, official as well as commercial co-financing sources. On the eve of the Bank's Fifteenth Annual Meeting, a Workshop on Co-Financing with
Commercial and Export Credit Sources, attended by
representatives from DMCs, commercial banks, the Bank
and export credit organizations, was held in Manila. The
Workshop provided a valuabie opportunity’ for an exchange
of views on ways of intensifying Bank efforts towards cofinancing with commercial and export credit sources (see
page 57).

During the year, a computer-based projects processing
information system was introduced to improve. monitoring
and control procedures for the processing .of projects and

{n recent years, particularly since the late 1970s, the
Bank has become increasingly concerned with activities
which will help alleviate poverty in its DMCs. While the
Bank recognizes that economic growth is the central factor in its developmental role, it is equally aware that
widespread poverty and inequitable income distribution
can disrupt and even negate economic gains by leading to
social or political instability. The Bank aims, therefore, to
combine employment creation and poverty reduction with
economic efficiency and viability as major objectives in its
development projects.

In this regard, there has been a discernible trend in Bank
operations since the mid-1970s in which the Bank has {i}
concentrated its concessional lending in the poorer DMCs;
(ii) emphasized investment in sectors which most benefit
the poor, such as small farm agriculture and social infrastructure; (iii) identified and designed individual projects
in such a way that their social impact would be high; and
{iv) Kberalized its modes of lending, Inciuding, for example,
the provision of focal cost financing in suitable cases. The
Bank takes care io ensure, however, that all its projects
meet the most rigorous tests of efficient resource allocation and sound management and banking practices.

The Bank-has tried to ensure that substantial benefits go
to its poorest borrowing couniries by directing almost ali of
its concessionai (ADF) iending to the low-income (Group A}
DMCs. During 1982, 98 per cent of the Bank's $546 million in
ADF fending went to the poorest countries — Bangladesh,
Burma, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The only middleincome {Group B) country to receive any ADF funding was
Papua New Guinea, which received $11 miilion for its
development bank for relending to agricultural, fisheries,
livestock, forestry and processing projects.

The Bank has also focused its lending in sectors where
most of the project benefits go directly to the poor,
especially agriculture and rural development and social Infrastructure, which includes urban development and housing, education, health and population, and water supply
and sanitation.

Bank-financed projects for agricutture and rural development, excluding agro-industry, received 34 per cent of total
Bank lending in 1982. Since the majority of the poor live in
tural areas and engage in agricuitural activities, Bankassisted agriculturai projects have a significant impact on
them. In order to ensure that project benefits actually reach
the intended beneficiaries, the Bank recently introduced a
Project Benefit Monitoring and Evaiuation {PBME) system
{see page 48).

Although the scope and emphasis of individual projects
differ according to national needs and priorities, they share
the common characteristic of helping the rural poor increase their productivity and incomes. Most projects concentrate on increasing agricultural production through the
expansion of irrigated land, multiple cropping and, in the
case of area development projects, the provision of credit
and fertilizer, health services, vocational training and
feeder roads. Examples of this type of Bank-assisted project for which loans were approved in 1982 are the Northwest Rural Development, Bhola Irrigation and Second
Tubewell projects in Bangladesh, the Pahang Barat integrated Agriculture Developmeni Project in Malaysia and
the Second Hifi irrigation Project in Nepal.

In many OMCs the rural poor depend on wood for heating
and cooking and in some timber-producing DMGs forestry
is an important income-generating activity for the landless
and smaliholder poor. in 1982, the Bank provided two loans
for forestry development, $10 million for the Community
Forestry Project in Sri Lanka and $25 million for the Second
Forestry Project in Burma.

Bank-assisted livestock projects are aimed at improving
the production capacity of the stock and increasing the
availability of animal protein for local villagers. In 1982, the
Bank approved loans of $25.7 million for the Sind Livestock
Project in Pakistan and $16.2 million for a Livestock
Development Project in Sri Lanka.

Bank loans for fisheries development also constitute an
important method of directly assisting the poor, as a large
percentage of Asia’s poor depend upon fishing for their
livelinood. In 1982, the Bank provided $92.4 million for three
fisheries projects. The Brackishwater Aquaculture Project
in Indonesia, for example, is expected to more than triple
the average income of 7,700 smallholder farmers from $600
to $1,900 per year. The Second Irian Jaya Fisheries
Development Project, also in indonesia, is designed to improve the living conditions of 2,800 low-income artisanal
fishermen and their families in Irian Jaya’s Sorong area,
and the Baluchistan Fisheries Development Project is ex
e

 

oopected to improve the standard of living of about 9,400
flshermen tn the least developed province in Pakistan.

Social Infrastructure projects, particularly those in the
Water Supply and Sanitation and Health and Population
sectors, are particularly well-suited to improving the standard of living of the very poor in that they provide — often
for the first time — the basic services so badly needed by
fow-Income groups.

During the year, the Bank made four loans in the Water
Supply and Sanitation sector, each of which will have an
impact on the poor of the recipient OMCs. In Bangladesh,
for example, improved water supply facilities in five district
towns are expected to serve around 850,000 people by 1990.
in Burma, a loan for a water supply project in Mandalay, the
country’s second iargest city, is expected to benefit nearly
500,000 people. Other Bank loans in this sector ~ to the
Republic of Korea and Thailand — are also expected to
benefit the urban and rural poor through integrated water
resource management and the elimination of waterborne
diseases.

During 1982, the Bank also supported two rural health
services projects. In Papua New Guinea aboui one million
people are expected to benefit from a project which aims to
provide basic health services in poor rural areas, and In Sri
Lanka it is expected that the rural population in eight
underserved districts will be provided with primary health
care and family planning services.

 

In addltton to providing assistance to sectors that directly ald the poor, the Bank also supports many projects that
produce indirect benefits. In 1982, the Bank approved road
improvement projects in Indonesia, Republic of Korea,
Malaysia and Phillppines which will provide access to
numerous rural areas which are at present inaccessible.
These roads will provide outlets for smalinolder farm produce, decrease the cost of agricultural Inputs and allow
greater mobility to the people Ilving In the project areas.
Another exampie Is the Bank-assisted Mini-Hydropower
Sector Project In Malaysia which wil bring electricity to
some 375,000 people living in remote villages in four states
of Peninsular Malaysia.

Each year the Bank continues to refine its strategy of
providing a greater level of assistance to the poor in its
DMCs, In the recent Study of the Bank's Operational
Priorities and Plans for the 1980s, an approach has been
outtined for the remainder of the decade that seeks to
enhance the Bank’s role in reducing poverty (see page 54).

First, the Bank’s poverty-reducing and employmentcreating efforts must not be confined to agriculture and
social infrastructure projects, but should be incorporated,
wherever feasible, into projects in other sectors such as
Development Banks and Transport and Communications.
Second, close attention must be paid — especiaily in projects addressed to the needs of the poor — to sociological
and cuitural factors and, most importantly, to institutionbuilding to correct administrative and management deficiencies. Third, poverty issues should be made an important part of the Bank's policy dialogue with its DMCs, In
summary, the Bank's objectives should be to support an appropriate blend of growth, employment creation and poverty alleviation throughout its broad range of development
activities.Support for Private Sector
Activities in DMCs

The private sector plays a significant role in the growth
of the Bank’s DMCs, accounting for a large proportion of
their gross domestic product. In view of this, it is essential
that private sector initiatives should be encouraged and
private investments promoted.

The Bank has been utilizing development finance institutions (DFls) as an effective conduit for loans to the private
sector. Since its very first loan in 1868, which was made toa
DFi, the Bank has consistently supported small and
medium-scale industries, many of them in the private sector, through credit lines. These enable the Bank to disperse
medium and long-term development funds to a large
number of smaller projects. the individual financing requirements of which are not iarge enough to warrant direct
Bank supervision.

The Bank, as of the end of 1982, had approved 70 such
foans totalling $1.46 billion to 28 DFIs in 19 borrowing countries. These loans accounted for about four-fifths of Bank
assistance io the industrial sector and about 13 per cent of
total Bank lending. The DFI loans were, in turn, farmed out
io 7,600 subprojects, 95 per cent of them in the private sector. covering a wide range of manufacturing industries such
as textiles, chemicals, paper, building materials, transport
equipment, iron and steel, metal and wire products, wood,
cork and food processing.

A significant ieatura of these credit Ilnes is that they
have proved to be perhaps the fastest vehicles for Bank
assistance. They lead to a quick transfer of resources to
ihe borrowing countries as well as to rapid generation of
economic benefits. Almost two-thirds of the Bank’s loans
to DFis have already been drawn down.

As an additional tool to promote private investment, the
Bank is now actively exploring the possibility of undertaking equity financing on a modest scale.' In this.connection,
the Bank hosted a Regional Seminar on Equity Financing in
Manila in February, at which the subject was exhaustively
discussed by senior representatives of DMC governments,
BFis and industrial groups (see page 56).

Aside from equity investment operations, the Bank also
initiated a study on how it could further diversify its operational activities to assist the private sector more effectively. Subject to the findings of this study, the methods that
May warrant examination include unguaranteed loans
{loans not guaranieed by the government of the recipient
DMC), guarantee operations, subordinated loans, and additional flexibility in allowing credit lines to DFls to be used
for equity financing, etc. This study is expected to be completed in 1983.

\n addition, the Bank is preparing to undertake a study on
capital markets in selected DMCs as a regional technical
assistance project in 1983. The study is expected to examine the status of capital market developments and identify possible areas for Bank assistance through technical
or financiai assistance.

During 1982, the Bank also continued to suppori the
private sector in its DMCs through more traditional forms
of assistance, such as its lending and technical assistance

operations in the Agriculture and Agro-Industry and Energy
sectors, as well as its support for infrastructure projects —
roads, ports, shipping. communications and utilities —
upon which private enterprises so frequently depend for
their efficient operation.

Bank operations in the Agriculture and Agro-lndustry
sector, for example, have helped assist the region's fargest
singie bloc of private entrepreneurs, the millions of smalt
farmers who have directly benefited from Bank-assisted irrigation and rural deveiopment and fertilizer projects. Many
other private enterprises have indirectly benefited as well
— particularly those firms involved in the hauling, trucking,
barging, milling. distribution or retailing of produce from
Bank-financed agriculture projects.Training Activities

The Bank's DMCs are becoming increasingly aware of
the need to develop human resources as an Integral part of
their economic development planning. In fact, the development of such resources represents a key factor in promoting economic growth, The DMCs are thus endeavoring
to evolve a balanced, rational approach to human-resource
planning atong with a well-designed strategy for better
organization, fuller development and more efficient use of
the human resources of their countries.

There are many factors which determine a country's
capacity for achieving economic growth and development.
Broadly speaking, they can be grouped Into three main
categories: human, physical and financial. The human
resource factor Is particularly important. A country may
possess abundant natura! resources and the necessary
machinery and capital equipment, but unless there are
people who can mobilize, organize and harness these
resources for the production of goods and services, It wil
not be able to make rapid strides towards economic and
social advancement. Thus, one of the major tasks confront.
ing the DMCs is the buliding up of “human capital.”

Since its inception, the Bank has been actively assistIng
its DMCs to augment such capital through Its training activities. These activities have included project-related tralning provided under Bank loans; training to support
institution-building activities under advisory and operatlonal technical assistance grants; general training activities offered on a regionaifnational basis through
regional technical assistance; and on-the-job training in the
Bank for seconded DMC officiats.

Because human resource and Institutional capabliitles
are essentia} in the implementation of projects, the Bank

energy in many DMCs — was included in the Fourth

provides project-retated training assistance in a variety of
ways. For instance, It offers training to the staff of executing agencies through consultants. In 4982, 12 ioans included such training components amounting to $9.7
million, more than double the amount allocated in the
previous year. Similarly, the Bank provides overseas training and fellowships for executing agency staff. This has involved Identifying specialized needs of key officials connected with project impiementation and then arranging offthe-Job training for them overseas, In 1982, 22 Bank loans
entailed overseas training and fellowships totalling $8.8
miltion,

The Bank has also provided training support under advisory and operational technical assistance grants to
estabiish or strengthen government institutions. These
granis included provisions for both on-the-job and off-thejob training assistance, In 1982, ten such grants totalling $4
millon were extendad by the Bank.

The Bank's regional technical assistance grants have
been for seminars and workshops dealing with procurement, project implementation, development banking, and
project appralsal methods and techniques. In 1982, the
Bank provided funds amounting to $1.2 million for 13
regional tralning activities which invoived a total of 442 par.
ticipants from 25 DMCs.

in pursuing its critical role In human resource and institutional development for its DMCs, the Bank will switch from
a project-oriented approach for training #0 an integrated
one serving a wider range of training needs. One reason for
this is that a strong executing agency will help ensure successful project Implementation; accordingly, the Bank will
step up still further Its institutlon-buliding efforts.

A key aspect of this strategy will be a new emphasis on
institution-buiiding associated more directly with improved
Bank tralning activities. This new initiative will be based on
an increasing recognition that the transfer of capital and
technology fs frequently not sufficlent to ensure Success,
whether at the macro-economic or at project fevel, and that
such capital transfer must be accompanied by measures to
bulld up effective focal institutions that can manage financlal and human resources In a cost-effective manner.

Environmental Activities

In Its efforts to promote socio-economic development
and improve environmental quality, the Bank recognizes
the need to avoid serious and irreversible damage to
natural resources and the environment. in this regard, the
Bank usually takes one of two approaches. Either the environmental aspects are systematically integrated in a
development project or they take the form of an environmental project per se.

Jn 1982, some 123 loan and technical assistance projects
in 21 DMCs were reviewed to assess their environmental
impact. Although most reviews were conducted at the appraisal stage of the project cycie, there were also sustained
efforts to introduce environmental considerations at earlier
stages — the planning of country programs, project identifleation and preparation and sector studies. It is expected
thai the environmental! dimension will be viewed eventually
as @ routine and integral part of project appraisal.

The primary objective of environmental review Is to identify potential! impacts, predict their magnitude, and devetop
protective measures to minimize environmental degradation. Examples of this in Bank-assisted projects include anair quality monitoring study to determine optimum stack
heights for a power plant in Thailand; an investigation of
land-based disposa! options for effluent discharges
generated by a proposed pulp and paper mill in Nepal; and
development of environmental planning and design criteria
for a hydropower project in the Philippines.

In undertaking these and other projects, the Bank works
closely with DMC government agencies. international institutions and non-governmental organizations in the environmental field. It has also establisned training programs
for Bank staff in aspects of environmental planning and
management.

Resource management is a matter of growing concern,
especially in the Bank's tropical DMCs which are inherently
more susceptible to environmental degradation and
ecological disturbances. Moreover, these countries tend to
have rapidly growing populations whose need for food. fuel
and shelter invariably strains the supporting capacity of
the local environment. This often resuits in overgrazing,
deforestation, lack of water, and increased disease
transmission.

Consequenily, developing country governments have
given greater attention to projects involving environmentaliresource planning (reforestation, shifting cultivation,
multiple water-usage. and poilution) and a growing number
of components have been included in Bank-assisted pro}ects ic heip meet these needs. Consistent with this approach, the Bank in 1982 approved a loan to formulate a.
basin-wide development and environmental plan in
southern Thailand for sustained development of water and
other natural resources, agriculture, urban and rural infrastructure and industry. This will help ensure the
systematic and orderly implementation of priority deveiopment projects and the optimum use of naturai resources
while minimizing environmental disturbance.

Sectoral Review

Agriculture and Agro-Indusitry

The largest portion of the Bank’s lending in 1982 went
once again to the Agriculture and Agro-Industry sector.
Lending to this sector amounted to $621.3 million (35.9 per
cent of lending overail), an increase of 14.7 per cent over
the level of 1981.

More than 50 per cent of the Bank’s technical assistance
in 1982 also went once again ta this sector.

These figures retiect the continued emphasis placed by
the Bank on assisting its DMCs in this vital field. For most
of the DMCs, agriculture accounts for between 25 and 60
per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and provides
employment for between 50 and 90 per cent of the labor
force. A major part of export earnings, from about one-third
to 90 per cent of all merchandise exports (including processed products}, also originates in this sector.

The achievement of major DMC development objectives
— such as increased tood production, employment creation, foreign exchange earnings and savings, and amelioration of poverty — remains heavily dependent on continued
development in this sector.

Tne Bank extended 22 project loans in this sector in 1982.
These included three technical assistance ioans and one
supplementary loan jor a project previously approved.

Within the sector, nearly half the tending (49.7 per cent}
went to irrigation and rural development. Agricultural support services, including agricultural credit, received the
next largest share (18.3 per cent}, followed by fisheries (14.9
per ceni), livestock (6.6 per cent}, forestry (5.6 per cent) and
industrial crops and agro-industry (4.9 per cent).

The Bank approved 28 technicai assistance grants in the
Agriculture and Agro-Industry sector in 1982 amounting to
$8 million. The largest portion of this — 19 grants for $4.2
million — went to irrigation and rural development.

As part of the Bank's efforts to examine the needs of its
borrowing DMCs in this secior and in order to formulate appropriate strategies. for responding to such requirements,
‘Bank staff and consultants compieted a comprehensive
Agriculture Sector Strategy Study of Nepal during 1982.
The siudy was financed by Sank technical assistance approved in December 1980.

Total lending te this sector as of the end of 1982
amounted to $3,427 million for 194 projects, white technical
assistance amounted to $58.8 million for 240 projects.

irrigation and Rural Development: The primary objectives of Bank-assisted agriculture projects continue to be
raising food production, diversifying agricultural output
and developing the rural economy. The centrai factor in
crop intensification strategies is irrigation, combined with
flood control and drainage measures. Close attention is,
however, also pald to increasing employment opportunities
and raising rurai incomes. An integrated approach to
agricultural and rural development projects is emphasized
and special emphasis is placed on strengthening rural institutions and designing brojects to achieve increased participation of smalihoiders and landless workers.

Emphasis is aiso piaced on smaller-scale schemes involving relatively simple technology which can be implemented fairly quickly and, for simiiar reasons, projecis

During 1982, the Bank approved a $77 million loan for an

Irrigation Package Project tn Indonesia under which ex:

isting irrigation systems will be rehabilitated and upgraded,
directly benefitting 82,460 farm families and indirectly
benefitting another 138,700 rural families in Java, of which
the majority are in the low-income bracket.

Three concessiona! loans were extended to Bangladesh,
all aimed at increasing agricultural output and alieviating
poverty among the landless and rural poor. The rapid
development of minor irrigation facilities under individual
and private group ownership and operation is the main
thrust of the Government's Medium Term Foodgrain Production Plan, which. is aimed at achieving self-sufficiency
in foodgrains. The primary objective of the Bhola Irrigation
Project {for which the Bank approved a loan of $27.2 million)
and the Second Tubewell Project ($56.5 million) is to help
achieve the Plan targets for minor irrigation, while the
Northwest Rural Development Project ($45 million) includes
a specific program to assist the landless.

Two projects involved co-financing with the International
Fund for Agricultura! Development (IFAD). These were the
Northwest Rural Development Project in Bangladesh (for
which IFAD provided $14.5 million) and the supplementary
joan for the Kirindi Oya irrigation and Settlement Project in
Sti Lanka (for which IFAD provided $6 million). The latter
also involved co-financing of $7.6 million from the Federal
Republic of Germany.

(n 1982, the Bank approved ten loans amounting to
$308.7 million in this subsector. This accounted for almost
50 per cent of the Bank’s total lending for Agriculture and
Agro-Industry during the year and raised the cumulative
lending for the subsector to $1,816.8 million.

industrial Crops and Agro-Industry: The Bank’s activities in this subsector cover the development and/or
related processing of plantation crops — such as tea, rubber, ofl paim and coconut — and that of field crops — such
as sugar, jute, cotton and rice. Assistance for fertilizer production is also included.

Buring the year, the Bank extended two toans to this
subsector amounting to $31 million, The first ($26.7 million
tor the Cotton Development Project in the Philippines) will
assist over 35,000 farm families to grow cotton to help meet
growing domestic demand and save foreign exchange used
for the import of cotton. The second ($4 million for the
Paper Mill Technica! Services Project in Nepal) will involve
the investigation, design, supervision and monitoring of the
construction of a mill which wifi produce printing and
writing paper, using local paddy straw and sabai grass as
basic feedstock.

As of the end of 1982, the Bank had provided a total of
$588 million in loans for 37 projects in this subsector.

Fisheries: The Bank has emerged as an important
source of financing of fisheries development projects in
Asia and the South Pacific. These projects have emphasized the importance of this subsector as a source of highProtein food, particularly for the lower-income groups, and
highlight its significant impact on economic growth,
employment generation and its potential for foreign exchange earnings.

During 1982, the Bank made three loans amounting to
$92.4 million for the fisheries subsector — the Second Irian

Jaya Fisheries and the Brackishwater Aquaculture Projects
in Indonesia and the Baluchistan Fisheries Project in
Pakistan.

As of the end of 1982, the Bank had made 32 loans
amounting to $460 million for fisheries and aquaculture
development.

Livestock: The Bank's experience in this subsector is
stil! rather limited, but the number of loans is increasing
and the scope of projects is broadening to encompass
almost all aspects of livestock development, including the
strengthening of government support services. The major
target group in most recent projects has been the smail
farmer.

During the year, the Bank approved two livestock loans
— the Sind Livestock Development Project in Pakistan and
the Livestock Development Project in Sri Lanka. Both are
designed to increase mainly smalinolder livestock output
and the supply of animal products to meet domestic
demand.

Forestry: in the forestry field, the Bank has assisted
projects relating tc log extraction, processing and afforestatlon for industrial use, fuelwood production and environmental protection. Due to diminishing wood supplies
and the increased cost of alternative sources of fuel, afforestation has become particularly urgent for many DMCs.

During 1982, the Bank approved two loans for forestry
totalling $36 million. The first — the Second Forestry
Development Project In Burma — is aimed at maintaining
Burma’s rich forest resources while increasing timber extraction, reducing transport losses and Improving recovery
and the quality of wood during processing. The United Natlons Development Programme (UNDP) will co-finance this
Project with $650,000. The second — the Community
Forestry Project in Srl Lanka — is designed to increase the
supply of fuelwood fos low-lncome rural dwellers.

As of the end of 1982, the Bank had provided seven loans
amounting to $88.7 million to the forestry subsector.

Agricultural Support Services: The Bank recognizes the
importance of agricuitural credit and other support services (such as research, extension, marketing and storage}
in promoting expanded agricultural productlon and improvIng the condition of the small farmer.

In 1982, three loans totalling $114 million were extended
In thts area. Two were for agricultural credit — $27.57
million for the Second Agricultural Credit Project In Indonesia which wil! also be supported by Switzerland with
$430,000 in co-financing, and $50 militon to the Agricultural
Development Bank of Pakistan. The third — $36 million for
the Agro-Processing and Marketing Project in the PhilipPines — wlll augment and modernize post-harvest and
marketing facilitles In the rlce and frult and vegetable
sectors.

Seven technica’ assistance grants totalllng almost $1

As of the end of 1982, the Bank had provided 24 loans for
agricultural support services projects (including
agricultural credit} totalling $340.5 million.

Energy

Activities in the Energy sector during 7982 reflected
policies that evoived fargely from the findings and recommendations of the Bank’s Regional Energy Survey (RES).
Completed in 1981, the RES recommended, Inter alia, that
the Bank increase its lending and technical assistance activitles, including co-financing, in the Energy sector. It also
recommended that the Bank broaden its portfolio by increasing support to the development of renewable and indigenous energy resources, the promotion of energy conservation and the enhancement of the capabilities of national energy planning institutions to formulate and tmpiement effectively comprehensive energy development pians
and policies. In order to cope with the increased and diversified work load, the Energy Planning Unti within the Industry and Development Banks Department served as the
focal point for the planning and development of Energy
Sector activities and for the formulation of policies and
strategies for the Bank's lending and technical assistance
operations.

The main thrust of the Bank's landing operations during
1982 in the Energy sector continued to be power development. However, increased emphasis was placed on the
development of indigenous, mostly renewable, energy
resources. Of the 11 loan projects approved during the year
in this sector, five were for the development of indigenous
resources. These loans, amounting to $198.6 million, will
assist in the installatlon of about 580 MW of hydropower
generating capacity in Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand.
Bank projects aiso envisage the utillzation of natural gas
for power generation, Two loans made during the year will
provide for the installation of 500 MW of gas power
generating capacity in Bangladesh and Pakistan.

Apart from the development and utilization of indigenous
resources, Bank activities were also aimed at the development of transmission and distribution facilities for electricity and natural gas. These included the rehabilitation
and reinforcement of existing distribution lines, expansionSPECIAL FUNDS LOAN APPROVALS

of extra high voltage and other transmission lines as well
as construction of new ones. In all, about 4,172 km. of extra
high voltage, transmission and distribution lines of various
voltages will be provided by Bank financing in Indonesia,
Republic of Korea, Philippines and Thaiiand. A gas project
in Bangladesh will help devetop onshore transmission and
distribution gas pipelines, while another, in Thailand, will
assist in the construction of offshore pipelines and an onshore compressor unit to enable the transmission of additional gas supplies.

Most of the Energy sector loans made in 1982 inciuded
components for strengthening institutional capability of
the executing agencies in such fields as manpower training, assistance in demand forecasting, hydrological
studies, project evaluation, inventory control, system pianning and load management activities. The implementation
of the generation and transmission and distribution projects is expected to result in reduced losses in distribution

and transmission and lesser dependence on ail use. Indirectly, these projects will also heip the growth of balanced regionat development and help alleviate balance-ofpayments problems.

Although the number of loan projects approved.in 1982
was unchanged from the previous year, the amount increased from $480.1 million to $513:7 million, The share of
the Energy sector in total Bank lending rose from 28.6 per
cent in 1981 to 29.7 per cent in 1982. Co-financing to the extent of $421.1 million was arranged tor eight projects:
$264.5 million from bilateral and multilateral sources for
four projects and $156.6 million from commercial and export credit sources for five projects. Total cumulative lending to the Energy sector amounted to $2,957.1 million at the
end of 1982,

“During 1982, technical assistance cperations in this sector underwent significant changes both in quantitative and
qualitative terms. Energy planning was promoted through
two technical assistance projects in Bangladesh, one for
national energy planning and the other for power system
planning. Renewable indigenous energy promotion through
hydropower development, both major and minor, wil! be
undertaken under three technical assistance grants ap
proved for Indonesia and Philippines. Development of.

another indigenous resource, coal, in the Philippines will be
undertaken in a feasibility study financed by a technical
assistance grant. Industrial energy audit and conservation
technical assistance grants were approved in order to help
Republic of Korea and Philippines to formulate more effective policies and programs for energy conservation.

Through another technical assistance project, rural electrification in the DMCs wiil be surveyed to help in tne
assessment and evaluation of rural electrification programs. Similarly, a review of refinery rationalization needs
in the DMCs will be undertaken to provide a broad assessment of the existing and prospective petroleum product imbaiances and, in the light of the future demand, to formulate strategies tor meeting the projected situation.

During the year, two major energy-related meetings were
held at the Bank: the Energy Planning Coordination
Meeting, which was aimed at coordinating Energy sector
technical assistance activities in the Bank's region; and the
Regional Power Utility Tariff Symposium, at which rational
approaches to determining appropriate power utility tariffs
were discussed (for additional details, see pages 56 and
58).

Othér related projects in the pipeline for 1983 include the
processing of the ASEAN Coal Development Study which
will look into projected demand and supply potential and
options in the ASEAN region and propose preliminary
strategies. Preparatory work was done on a Sail Boat Motor
Propulsion Project which aims to investigate the energy
saving potentials through retrofitting sails on motorpowered vessels used in inter-island shipping in the South
Pacific region. Preparatory work was well advanced on a
Second Natural Gas technical assistance project in
Bangladesh, an Energy Conservation technical assistance
project in Thailand and a Rural and Renewable Energy
Development technical assistance project in indonesia
aimed at examining the prospects of replacing oil with
local resources.

During 1982, the Bank’s technical assistance to the
Energy sector amounted to $5.23 million comprising $4.46
million for ten projects in the DMCs and $774,000 for six
regional Energy sector technical assistance grants.

industry and Non-Fuel Minerals

The majority of the Bank's DMCs continue to assign high
priority to industrializatlon as a strategy for achieving
balanced and accelerated soclo-economic development.
Although Industrial growth In many borrowing countries
has been affected in recent years by the rising costs of fuel
Imports and widespread recession, indusirialization remains a focal point in the economle development of the
reglon.

(mprovemenis in balance of payments through import
substitutlon and/or export diversification, higher employment generation, more equitable income distribution and a
wider dispersal of the ownership of the means of productlon are among the benefits sought by DMCs from industrialization. However, due to their diverse economic
conditions and cultural backgrounds, the potentlat for Industrial development In Individua! DMCs vartes greatly.

The Bank’s fundamental strategy Is to help DMCs
develop their industrial capacity and Industrial infrastructures, taking into account such factors as thelr individual
level of economic development, resource endowments, size
of domestic markets and Internatlonal trade. Traditionally,
the Bank has helped its DMCs to Industrialize by providing

and industrial management training for supporting
indusirial development, the Bank has also extended
assistance for the establishment, expansion and upgrading
of Industrial research institutes and industrial management training institutes, thereby helping small and
medium-scale industries achieve greater operational efficiency, higher productivity, better quality standards and
improved technology.

The development of non-fuel mineral resources for export and domestic consumption can make a significant
contribution towards Increasing foreign exchange earnings
and domestic revenues fn some DMCs, thus serving both to
improve balance of paymenis as well as stimulate
economle activity In other sectors. Severa! DMCs are
known to have significant amounts of untapped mineral
resources, but a major constraint In their development to
dats has been lack of basic Information and data for
assessing and evaiuating mineral deposits. The Bank
recognizes that systematic geological, geophysical and
gsochemlcal surveys can help facilitate more rapid mineral
resource development in DMCs through generation of

sector in 1982, therefore, focused on follow-ups to earlier
technical assistance for the development and upgrading of
national institutional capabilities and facilities for conducting mineral resource surveys and expioration programs.

During the year, the Bank approved a foan of $16.2 million
to Burma for a tin mining project, bringing cumulative Bank
lending to the Industry and Non-Fuel Minerals sector as of
the end of the year to 24 loans amounting to $391.44 million
for 22 projects in nine DMCs. The Bank had also extended
22 technical assistance grants amounting to $3.767 million
to this sector for 21 projects in nine countries (including
two regional studies).

Development Banks

During the year, the Bank continued to promote the
growth of smalf and medium-scate industries through
credit lines to DFis. In this way, the Bank is able to make
assistance available to comparatively small development
projects, the financing requirements of which are not individually jarge enough to warrant direct evaluation, financIng and follow-up. The Bank uses the DFis as channels to
reach specific target groups; It also augments the

 

resources of the DFis themselves and enables them to
assist a much larger number — and a much wider range —
of enterprises than might otherwise have been possible.

The Bank’s assistance to DFis is aiso directed towards
promoting financially sound and well-managed institutions
which can make significant contributions to the
developmental efforts in their respective countries. DFls
can do this by effectively mobilizing domestic and external
resources and efficiently aliocating them among carefully
chosen development projects. Apart from actively
strengthening and reorienting existing DFls in the region,
the Bank has also assisted in the establishment of new
DFls, particularly in the South Pacific.

The Bank has provided technical assistance to DFis for
institution-building purposes, Such assistance is extended
together with loans, or separately, as may be appropriate
and is utilized by DFls to-secure the services of experts to
advise and guide them in organizational and operational
matters and for staff training.

In 1982, the Bank extended credit fines of $1.5 million to
the Cook Islands Development Bank (C!DB) and $1 million
to the Development Bank of Vanuatu (DBV), the first time
the Bank had assisted these two South Pacific DFls. The
Bank’s Joan to CIDB — for which it had earlier provided
technical assistance — includes for the first time a component for financing low-cost housing construction. The loan

11,501.49to DBV was combined with a technical assistance grant of
$100,006 to facilitate Instltutlonal development.

The Bank aiso made four other loans to assist private inGustrlal enterprises: the Smal} and Medium Industry Bank
In the Republic of Korea ($50 million), the Industrial
Devetopment Bank of Pakistan ($40 million}, the Private
Development Corporation of the Philippines ($45 million),
and the Papua New Guinea Development Bank ($11 miilion,
combined with a technical assistance grant of $210,000 for
institution-bullding purposes). The Bank had previously extended sirnilar credit lines to each of these DFis.

Two of the credit lines approved in 1982 Involved cofinancing wlth commercial banks, the Seventh Smail and
Medium !ndustry Bank ($15 million) and the Sixth Private
Development Corporation of the Philippines ($26 miition). in
addltlon, $50 million in commercial co-financing was artanged In respect of the Fourth Korea Long Term Credit
Bank, for which the Bank extended a $60 million credit tine
in 1981, bringing to $100 million the total of commercial cofinancing for this Project.

in all, the seven loans for sIx prolects approved by the
Bank In this sector during the year amounted to $148.5
milllon. As of the end of 1982, the Bank had approved 70
such credit (Ines amounting to $1,459 million, representing
12.7 per cent of total Bank lending.

Transport and Communications

Bank lending to this sector showed a marked Increase
during the year foltowing the sharp but temporary decline
in 1981 when — due partly to special! circumstances including the cyclical! nature of Bank fending In some sectors
— the share of Bank lending for Transport and Communica:
tlons felt to only 4.3 per cent of total Bank lending for the
year.

In 1982, however, the Bank made six loans amounting to
$287.4 million or nearly 16 per cent of total fending, more
than three times the $72.4 miilion approved for thls sector
{nm the preylous year. Thls was In response to the demand
within DMCs for rellable low-cost transportation infrastructure and services with a view to reducing regional
disparities and promoting the closer Integration of rural
and national economies.

Bank loans to Indonesia and the Philippines approved
during the year wili help to construct, or upgrade and improve, nearly 2,000 km. of rural roads, in addition to about
850 km. of national roads. The projects are located in
diverse regions and cover numerous districts in these two
archipelagic DMCs. By comparison, only about 800 km. of
Tura] roads had been Improved with Bank assistance during
the entire preceding decade. Both projects included maintenance components and consultant services for
insiitutlon-building. Technical assistance grants for the
preparation of similar projects in the future were also extended to both countries with the aim of further systematic
improvement of roads In selected provinces.

Arising from earlier Bank technica! assistance, a loan for
upgrading the eastern section of the East-Wesi Highway in
Malaysia will complement Government investments in
agriculture, irrigation and land development in the fess
developed east coast states of the country, thereby helping
to reduce regional socio-economic disparities. Another
Bank-assisted project for the improvement of 400 km. of national roads and 27 bridges wif! result in the completion of a
pian io upgrade the primary national network of roads in

the southern part of the Republic of Korea.

One joan approved in 1982 will provide for consultant services for the preparation of a detailed engineering design
for the second phase development of Surabaya Port, as
well as for the development of Balikpapan and Banjarmasin
Ports in Indonesia where, over the years, the Bank has
financed many projects In this sector. In addition, master
plans and feasibility studies covering seven trunk ports in
central Indonesia will be prepared, followed by detailed
engineering designs for some of these ports on a selective
basis.

The Bank made its first loan in eight years for telecommunications — $29 million for a new microwave system
linking, inter alia, the cities of Karachi and Peshawar in
Pakistan.

Four projects approved for the Transport and Communicatlons sector in 1982 invoived co-flnancing amountIng to $146.5 million. The Tetecommunications Project in
Pakistan will be co-financed by the World Bank, the Federal
Republic of Germany, Japan and Governmentiother
sources. Assisiance from the Kuwait Fund will support the
Philippine road project, while funds from commercial
sources will be harnessed for the road projects in Malaysia
and Republic of Korea.

The Bank approved six technica! assistance projects for
this sector in 1882 — two for roads, three for ports and one
for a regional study. The latter will, in the light of relative
energy efficiencies of different modes of transport and the
need to conserve energy, assess the impact of energy costs
on transportation and the emerging priorities for future investment in this sector (see page 72).

As of the end of 1982, the Bank had made 96 loans
amounting to $4,611.2 million for 87 projects in the
Transport and Communications sector. Roads and ports
projects received the maior share (58.6 per cent and 30,1 per
cent, respectively), foltowed by airports {8.7 per cent),
tallways (2.9 per cent), and telecommunications (2.7 per
cent). Cumulativety, the share of lending to the sector as a
proportion of total lending since 1968 stood at 14 per cent.

Water Supply and Sanitation

It has been estimated that 80 per cent of all illness In
developing countries is linked to contaminated drinking
water and lack of adequate sanitation facilities. Moreover,
at any given time there are about 150 million Asians suffering from gastro-enteritis, a disease directly linked to dirty
water. To alleviate this situation, the United Nations has
declared the period 1981-1990 the International Drinking
Waiter Supply and Sanitation Decade. Its goat is to provide
access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitary
facilities for everyone by the end of the decade.

Formerly, the Bank's lending activities in this sector were ”
concentrated In assisting metropolitan and large urban
water supply and sewerage systems. However, the emphasis has recently shifted to more balanced development
in both urban and rural areas in order to promote social
equity and Improve the health conditions of rural, as well as
urban, communities. Reflecting this, the Bank in 1982 approved loans for the provision of water supply facilities in a
provincial capital, for the provision of water supply and
sanitation facilities in five district towns and for the treatment of human waste in 102 rural towns. tt also approved a
technical assistance program loan for a planning study involving an integrated approach to water resource manage-LABORATORY technicians at the Bedok Sewage Treatment Plant in Singapore, where a Bank loan will help to
double capacity to 116,000 cubic meters per day.

ment and economic and social development in a less
developed region. This trend is expected to continue and
several small town and rural water supply and sanitation
projects are being prepared for possibile Bank financing in
1983 or later.

During the year, a concessional loan was approved for a
project in Mandalay, Burma's second largest city. This will
provide clean and reliable water to 90 per cent of
Mandalay’s population of 500,000 and a phased investment
program for improving wastewater disposal and sanitation.
A concessional loan was also provided to Bangladesh for a
Project designed to improve and expand the existing water
supply facilities and commence the provision of adequate
sanitary facilities in five district towns with populations
ranging from 68,000 to 159,000. Some 102 rural municipalities with populations ranging from 5,000 to 57,000 in the
Republic of Korea will benefit from a $25.5 million Bank
loan which will provide some 66 cost-effective facilities for
treatment and disposal of human waste. In Thailand, more
balanced regional development and a more widespread
distribution of the benefits of economic growth will result
from a technical assistance program loan approved during
the year. This will finance an integrated study for water
resource management and economic and social development of the Songkhla Lake Basin and be followed by a
detaiied feasiblity study of selected high priority projects.

Two of these projects involved co-financing arrange
ments: the Mandalay Water Supply Project, for which the
OPEC Fund for International Development will provide $7
million; and the Songkhla Lake Basin Planning Study, for
which UNDP will provide $500,000.

The Bank approved five project preparatory technical
assistance grants in this sector in 1982 — in Bangladesh,
Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Nepal and Thailand. It aiso
approved one advisory and operational technical
assistance grant in Burma, as well as technical assistance
for a seminar which will address the problem of improving
the control of urban water supply distribution systems in
general and the problem of controlling unaccounted-for
water in particular.

The Bank approved four loans amounting to $57.9 million
for this sector in 1982. As of the end of 1982, total lending to
the Water Supply and Sanitation sector amounted to $887.4
million, covering 44 projects in 14 countries.

Urban Development

The Bank's approach in this sector has been to support
programs which are aimed at directly improving living conditions in low-income areas and which lead to more efficient urban growth. Consistent with the tatter objective, the
Bank has supported, in appropriate cases, development of
new towns or growth centers with rural hinterlands. Such
development, apart from providing essential services to the
predominantly low-income population, also serves to improve the spatial balance of economic infrastructure and
growth and thereby reduce pressure on large cities. The
Bank lays emphasis on pollcy issues and institutional

aspects, including financial management, in order to im- .

prove the capabilities of agencies responsible for urban
and regional development. While Bank-assisted Water Supply and Sanitation sector projects contribute directly to its
objectives in the Urban Development sector, increasing importance is also attached to complementarity of services
and an integrated approach towards urban development
and housing. . .

During 1982, the Bank approved $30.2 million for an urban development project as well as technical assistance
granis of $50,000 for a country urban sector profile and
$80,000 for a regional seminar.

The Second Trengganu Tengah Development Project in
Malaysia is designed to provide development roads and
basic settlement-related facilities in new towns as part of a
large resource-based regiona! development scheme in the
state of Trengganu. The Project, complementing two earlier
Bank loans related to that regional development scheme,
will provide for the construction of about 52 km. of new
roads and town development works in six new
towns/growth centers. On completion, the Project will
benefit about 40,000 people, mostly belonging to lowincome groups.

In Indonesia, a technical assistance grant for an urban
sector study will provide a comprehensive urban sector profile, including a review of experiences and impact of urban
sector programs/projects, which would enable the identification of potentials and priorities for Bank assistance in
the short and medium-term. The regional technical
assistance grant will bring together, through a seminar on
Financing of Low-Income Housing, senior officiats from
public, quasi-public and private agencies for discussions
on policies and financing of low-income housing. This will
lead to the identification of constraints and problems and

45their possible solutions.

At the end of 1982, total fending for the sector amounted
to $269.5 million for ten projects and $774,500 for six
technical assistance projects, excluding contributions
amounting to $854,500 from UNDP for three technical
assistance projects.

Education

The development of education in DMCs remains an important area of the Bank’s operational activities. In the
past, the Bank’s lending In this sector was channelled
mainly Into vocational and technical education and tralnIng. More recently, however, the Bank has played an Increasingly important role In a broader spectrum of educational activities,

in addition to the more traditional engineering craft and
technictan training, the Bank's Involvement in vocational
and technica! education now extends to agricultural educatlon, vocational courses for business, commercial art,
home economics and a variety of traditional crafts. Such
vocational and technical education projects support educatlonal development consistent with overall regional and natlonal economic development needs. Project components,
which are delineated In accordance with each country's
manpower and development needs, Include the development of curricula, teacher training, provision of equipment
and technical consuitants, fellowships for statf development, and management and institutional Improvement.

During the year, a separate Education Division was
established in the Bank in recognition of the crucial role
which education plays In the economic and social deveiopment of its DMCs.

The Bank provided $64.1 million !n three loans for education In 1982. In addition, the Swedish International Deveicpment Authority {SIDA} provided co-financing of $2.79
million and the United Nations Development Programme

(UNDP) a totai of $2.85 million.
The Vocational Education Project in Indonesia is designed to improve the: quality of vocational education and

.allevlate the country's shortage of skilled manpower. The

Project wili upgrade 26 vocational schools and provide for
the construction of 22 new schools. in addition, two vocatlonal education development centers wif! be established to
train vocational school teachers and improve the quailty of
vocational schools curricula. The Project is expected to
help increase the number of students enrolied annuafly in
business, home economics, and arts and crafts schools by
&0 per cent — from about 20,008 at present to about 30,000
on completion of the Project at the end of 1987.

The Technical Education Project in Sri Lanka — for which
the Bank has agreed to provide $16.1 million — has three components: (I) estabiishing'a National Technical Teachers Training College; {ii) fully upgrading ten technical institutes and providing laboratory facilities at ten other technical institutes;
and {ii} Improving the relevance and efficiency of technical
education in areas such as curricula, evaluation, inspection
and institutional resources development. As a result of the
Project, the craftsmen and technicians passing through the
technical institutes will be more highty skilled
In trades needed by the country for its planned
economic development. A smail increase in the number of
engineering graduates is expected because the Improvement
of the technical institutes should lead to a reduction in student drop-out rates.

The Science Education Project in Nepal — for which the
Bank has agreed to provide $8 million — is aimed at improvtng the quailty of sclence teaching in secondary schools in
Nepal. This should have the effect of Improving the quality
of students entering post-secondary technician training
centers and Institutions of science and technology. Under
the Project, 25 Science Education Development Units will
be established io provide In-service training programs for
sclence teachers and six existing pre-service science
teacher training institutes (which are campuses of
Tribhuvan University} will be upgraded. It is estimated that
about 180,000 secondary school students will benefit from
the Project. in addition, about 2,500 secondary science
teachers will have thelr knowledge and pedagogical skills
upgraded,

The Bank approved @ technical assistance grant to
prepare an agricultural educatlon project in indonesia.

At the end of 1982, Bank assistance for the Education
sector amounted to $360.4 milllon for 24 loans and $3.52
million for 19 technical assistance projecis.

Health and Population

High population growth rates continue to cause concern
in many OMCs. The trends In birth and death rates are
closely interrelated with the countries’ social and
economic development, including developments in the
heatth status of their populations. Delivery systems for
health and family planning services are closely linked .
In many.countries, and the Bank continues to adopt an
Integrated approach to population programs and heatth
Improvements.

Durlng 1982, two projects amounting to $21.3 milion
were approved for the Health and Population sector, one of
which resulted from previous Bank technical assistance.
The Health and Population Project in Sri Lanka, which the
Bank is supporting with a $9.3 million concessional loan,
constitutes the first phase of Government plans to improve
the country’s Integrated delivery system for health and
family planning services. The Project is to be implemented
In elght underserved districts and includes provisions for
the constructlon, upgrading and equipping of health
centers, support of In-service training programs and con
sultant services.
A Bank loan of $42 million was extended for the Rural

Health Services Project in Papua New Guinea which is
almed at improving the heaith services delivery system in
six of the country’s 19 provinces. The Project will belp in the
construction and upgrading of health centers and aid posts
and provide them with essential medical and communicatlons equipment. A provision has also been made io improve the avaitability and quality of water supplies and
sanitary facilities to rural communities as well as Government institutions such as health facitities and schools.
During the year, the Bank approved a itechnicat
assistance grant of $150,000 to Burma for preparation of
the Rangoon General Hospital Project and a grant of
$50,000 to Indonesia to help prepare a Health and Population sector profile. The study is expected to result in the
identification of potential areas for Bank support for this

_ sector in Indonesia.

At the end of 1982, the Bank had approved eight loans in
the Health and Population sector amounting to $134.7
million and $1.3 million for eight technical assistance
projects.ae . CONTRA (ARDE ISBURSEMEN
Loan Administration a paers ww Say ae TS

During 1982, 57 loans were approved and 60 loans had
become effective, including 48 loans approved in previous
years. This brought the total number of loans under administration to 375 compared with 357 in 1981. Of the projects being supervised, 103 involved co-financing with other
external sources.

Bank staff continued to monitor closely individual projects. During the year, 189 loan administration missions
visited 287 projects in the field to review the physical progress of projects and deal with specific loan administration
matters. In addition, 17 loan disbursement missions were
undertaken to explain disbursement procedures and help
expedite the submission to the Bank of loan withdrawal applications. Furthermore, in response to the requests of certain borrowing countries for periodic discussions on Bankfinanced projects, two project implementation review missions were sent to a borrowing country. In the course of
these, high-level review meetings were held with’ senior
government officials on broad institutional, financial and
procedural issues related to ongoing projects. Similar missions to other borrowing member countries will be carried
out in 1983.

Continuing an activity started in 1981, studies on the performance of three borrowing member countries in impiementing projects were undertaken by the Central Projects Services Office, bringing to six the total number of
country profile reports prepared by the Bank, These reports
identify and analyze country specific implementation problems and issues which are then discussed with central
government authorities. Enhancing the absorptive capacity
of the countries concerned is the main objective of this
exercise,

In 1982, measures to streamline internal procedures were
instituted In order to achieve greater efficiency in the
Bank's loan administration activities. A committee set up
in 1981 tc undertake a comprehensive review of loan administration practices and procedures completed its work
and made varlous recommendations invelving, among
other things, greater delagation of authority, simplification
of procedures and streamlining of work flows. Most of the
recommendations of the committee have been approved by
Management and adopted for implementation by Bank
staff. Others requiring the approval of the Board of Directors will be considered early in 1983, To complement these
efforts to streamline loan administration, computerization
of loan administration data and reports was initiated and a
Loan Financial Information System was started. This
system Is now being expanded to include additional project
data which will facititate the Bank's project monitoring activitles. Likewise, in order to avoid delays in selecting consultanis for project implementation, computerization of
consultants’ data through use of the Data on Consultants
{DACON) form has been accelerated. With regard to cofinanced projects, which are often more difficult to supervise, improvements in recording and reporting systems
were Introduced during the year.

in 1982, the Bank also provided assistance to project executing agencies to improve their project implementation
capabilities. Two regional seminars on procurement and
one on project Implementation management were condusted at the Bank’s Headquarters. in addition, three country seminars on procurement were held in Burma, Malaysia
and Srl Lanka. A total of 295 senior and middle-level officials participated in these seminars. To provide additional
guidance on procurement activities, a Handbook on Procurement was completed and Is now being provided to staff
of executing agencies. Likewise, sample tender
documents, prepared jolntiy with the World Bank and the
(Inter-American Development Bank, were finalized and will
be made available to Bank borrowers. With respect to consuftants, a Handbook on Recruitment of Consultants is
under preparatlon and is expected to be completed in earty
1983.

Two major indicators of overall project performance are
the totaf value of contracts awarded and disbursements.
Contracts for the supply of goods and services recorded a
substantial increase of 79 per ceni from $646 million in
1981 to $1,758 million In 1982. More than 16 per cent of the
total value of contracts awarded in 1982 went to suppliers
and consultants from DMGs, bringing the cumulative share
of DMCs in Bank-financed procurement to 13.6 per ceni
compared with 12.9 per cent in 1987.

Disbursements in 1882 amounted to $795 million compared with $687 million in 1981. Disbursements under ordinary loans amounted to $620 million, representing a 20
per cent increase over the 1981 figure of $518 million. With
respect to Special Funds loans, $175 million was disbursed, 17 per cent more than the $149 million disbursed in
1981 and a substantia! improvement over the marginal
reduction registered in that year. However, the 1982 figure
for Special Funds loans was still short of an earlier projection of $213 million and this was due primarily to large
shortfalls in three projects which experienced implementation difficulties. The increase of $128 million in ordinary
and Special Funds toan disbursements is significant considering the problems that most of the projects faced
because of budgetary difficulties.

Projects Completed

Thirty-six projacts were completed in 1982, bringing the
total number of projects completed to 208 out of 565 projects approved as of the end of the year, Project Completion
Reports (PCRs) are prepared for completed projects and 28
such PCRs were prepared in 1982 of which 13 have been
submitted to the Board of Directors and 15 are to be circulated in early 1983. A total of 81 PCRs have been
prepared up to the end of 1982.

Project Benefit Monitoring
and Evaluation

For many Bank-assisted projects additional activities
beyond those connected with project implementation are
required to ensure that benefits are achleved and sustained. In most irtigatton projects, for example, several
complementary activities are required for the accrual of
benefits, Including (i) delivery of irrigation services, {ii}
delivery of supporting agricultural services, and {iii}
marketing services and pricing Incenilves. Through loan
covenanis and assurances the Bank seeks fo ensure that
these necessary services are provided and that an appropriate policy environment is also present. However, experience indicates that additional efforts are required to ensure that benefits are actually achieved, particularly in
complex projects and in most Agriculture and Rural
Development projects.

To help ensure that development services are received by
intended beneficiaries and that project benefits actually
accrue, the Bank recently introduced Project Benefit
Monitoring and Evaluation (PBME) into many projects. The
Agriculture and Rural Development Department developed
Guldeiines on Logical Framework Planning (LFP) and Pro}ect Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation (PBME) in August
1980, appointed a Project Economist (PBME) in August
1982 and heid an in-house seminar/workshop on PBME in
November 1982.

PBME Is an organized sequence of activities that provides information to concerned agencles to (i) measure
socio-economic benefits in the project area; {ii} specify

‘ those areas where corrective action-is needed; and (iii)

assist policy makers examine the influence of various
policies and procedures concerning the achievement of intended project benefits. PBME data also serve other purposes. PBME benchmark surveys, if completed prior to appraisal, assist executing agencies and Bank staff in project
formulation and appraisal. Information generated through
PBME activities wilt also be used by executing agencies
and the Bank in PCRs and in evaluation studies conducted
by the Post-Evaluation Office.

In 1983, PBME will be more thoroughly incorporated into
Bank practices and a Regional Seminar on PBME is also
planned. Methodologies for specific categories of
agricultural and rural development projects are being
developed and will be incorporated into project preparation. As required, Agriculture and Rural Development
Department staff conduct PBME missions in addition to
normal loan administration missions. Educational
materials and programs for Bank staff and for personnel in
appropriate DMC agencies will be offered.

Work has also commenced on developing PBME systems
for infrastructure projects and a regional seminar is pro-posed to be convened in 1983 to discuss PBME
methodology for education projects.

Post-Evaluation

The Post-Evaluation Office (PEO) is organized as a
separate unit and it reports direct to the President. Independent assessment of Bank projects in the Project Performance Audit Reports (PPARs), which that office
prepares, embraces all aspects of the Bank's operational
activities including project preparation, appraisal, implementation, operating performance, economic returns,
the Bank's monitoring performance and achievement of
project objectives. Lessons derived from the postevaluation of compieted projects are, where appropriate,
translated into inputs for poticy making, for shaping the
operational activities and improving project implsmentation in subsequent activities in the sector and in the DMCs.
The Board of Directors attaches particular importance to
the post-evaluation function and its Audit Committee is required, among other things, to satisfy itself that the postavaluation activities are adequate and efficient. in its Annual Report to the Board, the Audit Committee welcomed
the continued strengthening of the post-evaluation activities of the Bank.

During 1982, 23 PPARs were prepared. These covered
projects in Burma (one fisheries and one general
agriculture project), Indonesia (two irrigation projects),
Republic of Korea (one irrigation, one water supply, one
road and one industrial project), Malaysia (one rural
development, one road and one water supply project),
Pakistan (one power project), Panua New Guinea (one road
project), Philippines (one power, one road and one port project), Sri Lanka (one fisheries and one irrigation project),
Thailand (one education and one development bank project}, Tonga (one telecommunications project) and Western
Samoa {one telecommunications and one development
bank project). As of 31 December 1982 a total of 81 PPARs
had been prepared. Of the 91 projects completed prior to
ihe end of 1978, 57 have been or are being post-evaluated.
The Bank proposes to post-evaluate all projects completed
since 1979 for which Project Completion Reports have been
prepared.

The Fourth Review of Post-Evaluation Reports was
issued in April 1982. This Review covered 22 projects {involving 29 loans, including two supplementary loans and
five blended loans) post-evaluated during 1981. These projects involved a total investment of about $733 million, of
which the Bank provided about $250 million. The Review
found that 13 projects (about 60 per cent) were successfully
implemented and fulfilled their objectives, some
remarkably well; seven projects (approximately 30 per cent)
only partially achieved their objectives; and two projects
(about 10 per cent) could be considered as marginal,
although even these did have some positive impact on the
borrowing country. These 22 projects were approved between 1970 and 1975, and a large proporiion suffered from
the effects of the unsetiled conditions and more severe inflationary trends of the mid-1970s after the energy crisis.

The Review brought to light a number of factors that had
an impact on successful project implementation, including
project preparation, designs, cost overruns, delays, and
capability and experience of executing agencies. The
Review focused on the experience of the Bank in
institution-buiiding during the 1970s. In many cases, it was

   

concluded, this experience had been satisfactory and improvements had been made in the administration and technical caoabilities of executing agencies. It was often found
that Bank monitoring played a crucial role in strengthening
the executing agencies and in avoiding delays. Based on
the post-evaluation findings a number of recommendations
were made in reiation to projeci preparation, impiementation schedules, financial covenants and forecasts,
institution-Duilding aspects of tne Bank's operations and
follow-up action on some post-evaluation findings.

in 1982. the role of the PEO was expanded to inciude the
preparation of effectiveness and impact studies. During the
year, work was initiated on four special studies to examine
the effectiveness of certain operational activities and to
evaluate their impact. These comprised a fisheries sector
impact study and three studies on the effectiveness of executing agency arrangements, project-related technical
assistance and training in DFis.

The fisheries subsector has presented difficulties, some
of which are attributable to the energy crisis, and the
fisheries sector impact study will focus on a review of the
Bank's experience and issues to be resoived in its future
operations as well as common problems in this sector. The
objectives of the study of executing agency arrangements
are to assess those arrangements which have been
adopted for the Bank’s {can and technical assistance
projects and to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of
alternative implementation arrangements. Technical
assistance, financed by grants or under loans, is an important component of the Bank's assistance to its DMCs. The
study of this assistance aims at evaluating its effectiveness. in strengthening institutions and improving their
planning, design and implementation capabilities.

To date, the Bank has organized 24 regional training programs for personnel of DFls. The strengths and
weaknesses of these training activities are being assessed
under a special PEO study.

During the year, the practice was initiated of inviting PEO
staff to attend meetings concerned with the processing of
new loan proposals, with a view to ensuring that the experience gained from completed projects — as determined
through post-evaluation studies — is appropriately taken
into account in the formulation of new projects. This is a
useful and timely development which should have a
beneficial impact on the Bank's assistance to its OMCs.

Technical Assistance
and Regional Activities

During 1982, the Bank provided $18 milllon in technicat
assistance (including technica? assistance for regional actIlvitles) for 80 projects compared with $16.6 mililon for 62
projects in 1981. Of this, $15.5 millton was for project
preparatory and advisory/opsrational technical assistance
for 56 projects in 12 DMCs compared with $14.8 million for
49 projects In 16 DMCs In 1981.

About 61 per cent of the increase in the number and
almost half the increase in the amount of technical
assistance projects approved during the year were due to
the greater emphasis being given to reglonail activities —
such as training programs and workshops, seminars and
surveys — for which grants ross from $1.8 million for 13
projects in 1981 to $2.5 million for 24 projects in 1982.

the Bank or from other sources.

In broad terms, the Bank provides three types of
technical assistance: project preparatory, advisory and
operational (including project implementation/supervision),
and regional. Project preparatory technical assistance is
aimed at helping a borrower to formulate viable investment
projects for subsequent financing by the Bank or other
sources. Advisory and operational technical assistance is
directed towards assisting executing agencies in
institution-bullding and in the supervision, implementation
and operation of Bank-financed projects. This includes the
tralning of local personne! and Improvements to technical,
flnancial and administrative management. It is also provided for studies on sectoral pollcles or for formulating natlonal development ptans.

Reglonal technical assistance, on the other nand, is addressed to needs that are common to more than one DMC.

In recent years, roughly 40 per cent of the Bank’s tota!
technical assistance has been for project preparation, 50
per cent for advisory and operational, and the remaining 10
per cent for regiona: activities.

During 1982, project preparatory technical assistance
amounted to $7.9 million for 43 projects, while advisory and
operational technical assistance amounted to $7.6 miltion
for 13 projects. These amounts included technical
assistance grant components incorporated in 20 Bank
loans amounting to $6.5 miilion, of which $1.8 million was
for project preparation and $4.7 million for advisory and
operational {including implementation).

Technical assistance grants are financed mainly from
the Sank’s Technical Assistance Special Fund (see page
84). In addition, the Bank acts as Executing Agency for
technical assistance projects financed from other
multilateral and bilateral sources such as UNDP and the
Government of Switzerland. The Bank also cooperates with
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on a costsharing basis in providing technical assistance for the
preparation of projects in the agriculture sector.

In 1982, eight technical assistance projects amounting to
$5.1 million were wholly of partly financed from other
sources with the Bank acting as Executing Agency, comprising six projects for $4.3 million from UNDP and two projects
for $0.8 million from the Swiss Government. In addition, four
projects received assistance from FAO on a cost-sharing
basis.

Twelve DMCs received project preparatory and advisoryfoperational technical assistance from the Bank
amounting te $15.5 million for 56 projects in 1982,
Technical assistance grants provided to South Pacific
DMGs in 1982 amounted to $1.2 million for seven projects
compared with $576,000 for five projects in the previous
year.

On a sectoral basis, 51.8 per cent of the total amount of
technical assistance approved in 1982 was for Agriculture
and Agro-Industry compared with 55.2 per cent in 1981.
Technical assistance in this sector involved, among other
things, irrigation, agricultural credit, rural development,
forestry, livestock and fisheries, smallhoider agriculture,
aquaculture, integrated area development, foadgrain
storage and cotton development, About 28.7 per cent was
provided to the Energy sector to cover mainly rural eiectrification and mini-hydropower development, 5 per cent to
the Transport and Communications sector and the rest to
Development Banks, industry and Non-Fuel Minerals,
Water Supply and Sanitation, Urban Development and
Education.

The importance of technical assistance to the Bank’s
lending program is underscored by the fact that by the end
of 1982, 229 Bank loans amounting to $4,558 million had
resulted from earlier technical assistance amounting to
$55.9 million provided by the Bank. in 1982, 33 loans amounting to $976.3 million resulted from earlier technical
assistance; of this $585.5 million was from OCR and $390.8
million from SF, representing 49 per cent and 72 per cent,
respectively, of total loan approvals from each of these
sources in 1982. This aiso highlights the importance of
technical assistance in the Bank’s concessional lending

operations to the low-income DMCs, and those DMCs which
are fully etigible for SF !ending received $8.1 million for 22
projects compared with $9.5 million for 26 projects in 1981.

A total of 36 technical assistance projects, mostly approved in previous years, were completed in 1982, 32 projacts for project preparation and four projects for advisory
and operational purposes, bringing the total number of
technical assistance projects completed to 330 projects.
The total amount of technical assistance grants provided
to DMCs as of the end of 1982 stood at $106.8 million.

Regional Activities

Study of the Bank’s Operational Priorities and Plans for
the 1980s: In November, the Study of the Bank’s Operational Priorities and Plans for the 1980s was completed.
The main objective of this Study was to review the entire
tange of policies and procedures that affect the Bank's
operationai programs and to develop strategies and
guidelines for Bank operations in the medium-term up to
the end of 1987, especially in the context of the resources
constraints that are expected to prevaii in this decade. This
was the first time in the Bank's 16 years of existence that
such a comprehensive review had been undertaken.

Although the Study was essentially carried out by Bank
staff, it benefited from guidance by an Advisory Group of
five eminent outside experts on the conduct of the Study.
The Advisory Group comprised Prof. John P. Lewis of
Princeton University (Chairman), Dr. Nurul islam of the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Prof. Kiyoshi Kojima of Hitotsubashi University, Japan, Prof. Mohammed

Operational and Financial Policies

During 1982, the Board of Directors considered a number
of operational and financial policies. On the resources side,
the Board considered several papers concerning the third
General Capitat Increase (GCI) of the Bank. It is envisaged
that the Board’s findings and recommendations on the GCl
would be submitted to the Board of Governors in early 1983."

During the year, the Board also submitted to the Board of
Governors for approval a Report and draft Resolution on
the third Asian Development Fund replenishment (ADF IV).

In December, certain revisions, both to the Ordinary
Operations Loan Regulations and the Special Operations
Loan Regulations, were adopted by the Board. The objective of the revisions, in the case of the Ordinary Operations
Loan Regulations, was to implement the Exchange Risk
Pooting System, and, in the case of the Speciai Operations
Loan Regulations, was to enable ADF loans to be
denominated in SDR.

The Board also reviewed the formula for the Allocation of
Administrative Expenses between Ordinary Capital
Resources and ihe Asian Development Fund. lt was decided to continue the present formula as it reflects
reasonably the shares of administrative expenses allocable
to both resources.

During 1982, the Board approved a recommendation that
the Bank apply to the International Monetary Fund (iMF) for
prescription as an authorized holder of special drawing
rights of the IMF. The Bank was formally prescribed as a
hoider of special drawing rights by the IMF on 15 October
1982 and accordingly is authorized to accept, hold, and use
special drawing rights in transactions and operations in accordance with terms and conditions established by the
IMF.

During the year, the Board approved revised arrangements
for cooperation with the European Economic Community
(EEC), it was decided that co-financing between the Bank
and the EEC would in future be on a parallel basis, with the
EEC directly responsible for the administration of EECfinanced project components under the Bank’s general coordination.

in addition, several other operational and financial poticy
issues were considered by the Board in 1982, including CoFinancing with Commercial and Export Credit Sources,
Equity Investment Operations of the Bank, Post-Evaluation
Activities, Procedural Guidelines for Special Increasés in
Capital Subscriptions, Annual Review of the Financial
Policies of the Bank, Lending Rate Review and Revised Investment Guidelines.” Some of these issues will receive turther consideration in 1983.

Co-Financing with: Commercial
and Export Credit Sources
The Bank's policy on co-financing with commercial and

export credit sources was reviewed in May. Incorporating
various views expressed in the review, a policy paper was

 

1 in March 1983, the Boara of Direclors submitted to ihe Board of Governors
for approvai a draft Resolution lor a third Genera: Capital Increase of 105
per cent with a 5 per cent paic-in portion.

Guidelines for Speciai Increases in Caplial Subscriptions (page 75}, Annual
Raview of Financia: Pol of the Bank (nage 76); Revised investment
Guide'lnes (nage 77}; anc Lending Rale Review (page 78).

 

    

 

 

approved by the Board of Directors in August as an acceptable working basis for promoting co-financing with these
sources.

. The Board generally endorsed the need for increased efforts
in promoting co-financing with commercial and export credit

. Sources. It was recognized that co-financing with such

sources could complement the Bank's assistance to its DMCs
and enhance its catalytic role in development. In order to augment resource transfers to the DMCs, such co-financing would
be over and above the Bank’s planned lending levels. However,
the decision to accept such co-financing should be that of the
DMCs and should not be a condition for the Bank’s own loans.

It was felt that the Bank should create a positive and conducive environment for co-financing with commercial and export credit Sources. Measures that could be taken in this
direction include: identifying suitable projects for cofinancing in country prograrnming; widening the eligibility of
co-financing for all DMCs, including low-income countries;
expanding co-financing publicity programs, including
seminars and workshops; hoiding frequent consultations
and systematically exploring co-financing possibilities with
both DMCs and potential co-financiers as early as possible
in the project cycle; and providing coordination and ~
technical services to co-financiers and to DMCs.

Several promotional measures were supported. These included, among other things, strengthening the arrangements relating to the optional cross-default clause,
adopting complementary financing schemes, adjusting
maturities of Bank loans, and using lines of credit from cofinanciers for specific projects or programs and consideration of loosely connected parallel financing schemes. The
Board also endorsed the need for the Bank to take a flexible
approach to the promotion of such co-financing.

Equity Investment Operations by the Bank

During the year, a preliminary examination on equity invesiment operations was made by the Board of Directors
and reported to the Board of Governors ai the Fifteenth Annual Meeting. The examination followed a Regional
Seminar on Equity Financing held at the Bank’s Headquarters in February (see page 56). The Board considered
the Issue !n greater detail following the Annual Meeting.

it was recognized that in the light of recent developments
in the international economy and the prospective changes
in the economic situation of the DMCs, there was a need for
the Bank to supplement the efforts of the OMCs in mobilizing additional financial resources to meet their development needs. A possible equity investment facility was seen
as enabilng the Bank to provide assistance directly to a
wide range of productive ventures in the private sector and
could complement the Bank's indirect lending to industrial
projects through DFls.

The Board considered various aspects relating to the
possible undertaking of equity investment operations. A
revised Board paper, taking into account the Board discussion, was circulated to the Board towards the end of 1982
and is expected to be considered by the Board in early 1983
for a final decision and further report to the Board of
Governors.!

Policies Under Consideration

A polley paper on Review of Arrangemenis for Lending
from the Asian Development Fund (1982-1988) was scheduled for consideration by the Board in early 1983. At the end
of the year, several major policy papers were being finallzed
or were under preparation for circulation and consideration
by the Board in early 1983, including Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditures on Projects, Program Lending and Technical Assistance Operations. Other
important policies are to be reviewed later in the year.

Inter-Agency Cooperation

During the year, the Bank strengthened its links with
other major International institutions Involved In the socioeconomic advancement of the Asia-Pacific region. tn pasticular, contacts were increased and strengthened with the
World Bank group, the International Fund for Agricuitural
Development, the OPEC Fund for International Development, the United Nations Development Programme, the
Food and Agriculture Organization, the European
Economic Community as well’ as several other major international institutions. Several computer systems and’ programs developed in the Bank were transferred for use by
ihe Islamic Development Bank.

Meeting of International Financial institutions

{n September, the President of the Bank attended a
meeting of international Financial institutions (iFIs} in
Toronto, Canada. The meeting was also attended by the

ly confronting the IFls was discussed, including the effects of current resource constraints on the planned level
of lending operations of IFls over the next five years, the
progress of capital resource replenishment of multilateral
financial institutions, the role of the donor agencies in

facilitating greater non-concessional flows to developing

countries and new initiatives in co-financing.

World Bank Group

During the year, the Bank maintained close contact with
the World Bank. The fourth annual ADB-World Bank highievel coordination meeting was held in Manila in May 1982
at the Bank’s Headquarters. At the meeting, overall policy

and other arrangements.

The President of the Bank attended the Nineteenth
Development Committee meeting in Toronto, Canada, in
September. The meeting, which reviewed the issue of
transferring real resources to the developing countries,
focused attention on the replenishment of resources by the
IDA in the World Bank group and on the efforts of the World
Bank and the Regional Deveiopment Banks to secure additional non-concessionat flows of funds to developing countries through co-financing with private sources.

Agricultural Development

Under the aegis of the Coaperation Agreement between
the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)
and the Bank, concluded in 1978, close cooperation and
consultation between the two bodies was maintained in
4982. Although no projects were appraised by the Bank for
exclusive financing by IFAD during the year, two Bankfinanced projects were co-financed by IFAD in an amount
of $20.5 mittion.

OPEC Fund for International Development

The close cooperation between the Bank and the OPEC
Fund for International Development continued in 1982. The
Assistant Director-General of the OPEC Fund had meetings
with delegations from several DMCs and Bank staff during
the Bank's Fifteenth Annual Meeting and discussed
possibilities of development assistance from the OPEC
Fund. in 1982, the OPEC Fund provided $74.5.million in cofinancing for four Bank-assisted projects. Bank representatives visited the OPEC Fund to exchange views on future

and improve the cooperative procedures and modify the
cost-sharing arrangements. Annual reviews of the
cooperative program between the Bank and the FAO Investment Centre took piace in January (for 1982) and December
(for 1983). Four projects were prepared by the Centre under
the cost-sharing arrangements during the year.

Aid Group Meetings

Bank representatives participated in the annual Aid
Group Meetings organized by the Worid Bank for
Bangladesh, Burma, Republic of Korea, Pakistan, Philippines and Sri Lanka. The Bank was also represented at the
Annual Meeting of the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) organized by the Government of the
Netherlands.

European Economic Community

Due to the policy reorientation in the manner of the
Bank's cooperation with the European Economic Com
61munity (EEC) (see page 59), 1982 was a year of consolidation and preparation for future relationship between the
two bodies. A grant of $2.8 million equivalent was provided
by the EEC jor the Bhola Irrigation Project in Bangladesh.
in addiilon, a technical assistance grant of about $1.1
milllon equivalent was provided to the Bank under a chanrel financing arrangement for tinancing technical
assistance to eligible DMCs.

Other International Organizations

The Bank maintained close contact with other
multilateral and bilateral agencies in 1982 through discussions and meetings, exchange of information, attendance
at conferences and seminars as well as through specific
project and sector activities.

The United Nations Fund for Population Activities
(UNFPA} was Included, for the first time, in the Bank’s list
of Officiai Observers invited for the 1982 Annual Meeting of
the Board of Governors. The World Health Organization
(WHO) and UNFPA were associated with the Bank in formulating and preparing the Health and Population Project
in Sri Lanka. Similar interaction will continue during project
imptementation, particularly wlth UNFPA, whose aciivities
in Srl Lanka will complement this Bank-assisted Project.
WHO participated In a joint review of population, health
and nutrition in the Philippines in association with the
World Bank, the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) and the Bank. The Rural Health Services Project in Papua New Guinea, also approved in 1982,
resulted from a feasibility study prepared by WHO under
earlier Bank-financed technical assistance. Staff of the
United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) asslsted the Bank in studies

relating to the evaluation and benefit monitoring of education projects trom which a regionai activity is expected to
emerge. The third meeting of the Committee of international Development Institutions on the Environment (CIDIE)
was among the more important conferences at which the
Bank was represented as a member. The Committee is an
important link between the Bank and the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP),

Cooperation with Bilateral Sources

Reftecting the Bank’s increased emphasis on cofinancing, consultations with bitateral aid agencies were
stepped up during 1982 with the aim of promoting even
closer cooperation with these sources. A Bank delegation
visited Abu Dhabi Fund, Kuwalt Fund, Saud! Fund and the
islamic Development Bank to establish working arrangements with these agencies and consultations were
held in Manila with the Islamic Development Bank and the
Saudi Fund.

Bilateral contacts with European financing sources also
increased. !n addition, under the cooperation arrangement
entered into in 1980 between the Bank and Switzerland
relating to Swiss financing of technical assistance, two
technica! assistance projects amounting to $0.8 million in
Indonesia and Thailand were approved by the Bank in 1982.
This brings the cumulative total of assistance under the
agreement to $5.1 miilion, equivalent to about SwF10.7
million.

Representatlves from the Australian Development
Assistance Bureau, the Canadian International Development Agency and the Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund also visited the Bank during the year to discuss cofinancing opportunities.

and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966. Since the coming
into effect of the Second Amendment to the Articles of
Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on 1
April 1878, currencies no longer have par vaiues in terms of
gold. The implications of this change for the valuation of
the Bank's capital stock are under examination by the

Bank. Pending a decision on this matter, the value of the
Bank's capital stock is expressed, for purposes of the
Bank's financial statements, in terms of the SDR on the
basis thai each share has the value of SDR10,000. The
mutual obligations of each member and ihe Bank with
tespect to maintenance of value of currency holdings is
also measured by the same standard, but settlement of
such obligations is being held in abeyance. For purposes of
the financial statements, the SDR is translated into current
United States dollars at the rate computed by the IMF. As
of 31 December 1982, the rate was $1.10311 per SDR. Fur
_ ther information on valuation of capital and maintenance of

vaiue is given in Notes A and D of the Notes to Financial
Statemenis of Ordinary Capita! Resources, Appendix I-Vil.

Proposed Third General Capital Increase

Pursuant to Board of Governors’ Resolution No. 134, the
Bank in 1982 continued to review future resource requirements for its ordinary operations. A number of working papers on the subject were considered by the Board of
Directors. As of the end of the year, however, the basic
issues of the size and composition of the proposed Capital
increase were sti} pending. It was anticipated that a consensus would emerge early in 1983. Depending on such
consensus, it was envisaged that the Board of Directors’
findings and recommendations on a third General Capital
Increase could be submitted to the Board of Governors in
March 1983."

Special Increases in Subscriptions

During the year, the Board of Directors considered procedural guidelines for special increases in capital subscriptions of individual members, and approved a procedure for
muitilateral consultation in this regard. The Bank received
a number of requests for special increases, and the Board
of Directors held several informal meetings to consider
possible criteria for dealing with such requests. However,

 

1 in March 1983, the Board af Directors submitted tc the Board of Governors
for approvai a cra‘t Resotutior for a third Generai Capttal Increase of 105
per cent with a $ per cent said-in portion.

FOREGROUND: Low-income housing units under construction in Seoul, Republic of Korea. The Bank-assisted Second Low
income Urban Housing Project will eventually benefit over 43,000
Beopie in Seoul and five other cities.76

no conclusions had been reached by the end of the year
and further discussions were expected to be held tn 1983 to
resolve outstanding issues.

Progress of Second General Capital Increase

In May, the Board of Governors adopted Resolution No.
153 whereby the final date for subscriptions to the second
General Capital Increase was further extended to 30 April
1983. As of 31 December 1982, ali except two members had
subscribed to their entitlements, bringing the aggregate of
subscriptions under the second General Capltal increase to
$4,511.4 million (SOR4,089.7 milfion}. An amount of $42.0
million (SDR38, 1 million) remained avallable for subscription.

Financial Policies

The annual review of the Bank's financial policies was
undertaken early In the year and covered, among other
things, lending and borrowing programs for the year, financtal objectives and indicators, and policies relating io liquidity, Income and reserves. Subsequently, the Bank commissioned an Independent consultant of high International
standing to prepare a comprehensive study of its financial
policies. To facilitate discussions on the third General
Capital Increase, the consultant in Apri! submitted an Interim report on two financial pollcy issues, namely, special
reserve and gearing ratio. The final study, which !s expected to be available In early 1983, will serve as a basis for
the Bank’s financial policy formutation and for Its financlal
planning and management. Pending completion of the
study and the Bank's review of Its findings, the existing
framework of the Bank’s flnanclai policles Is to continue
unchanged.

in vlew of the Increasing Importance of reviewing the
Bank’s financial policles, plans and projections on a continulng basls and the need to examine critically the Bank’s
longer-range financial management poilcies In the context
of Its overall development financing objectives, the appropriate organizational management for handling this
function was reviewed and strengthened during the year
(for additional detaits, see page 88).

Borrowings

Ouring 1982 the Bank made 14 borrowings amounting to
the eguivatent of $881.8 million compared with a total
equivalent to $668.5 milion raised in 1981. Details of the
year’s borrowings are shown in the table on page 77.

In pursuance of its continuing efforts to diversify its borrowings and in view of its expanding borrowing program,
the Bank made its first public offerings in the Dutch
domestic capital market and re-entered the United States
capital market after an interval of six years. In the Dutch
domestic market the Bank made two public bond issues, in
February and August, each for {100 million, while in the
United States market it undertook a public offering in July
for a principal amount of $400 miilion of zero coupon notes
sold at a deep discount from face value.

The Japanese market remained the largest source of borrowings in view of the availability of funds in that market on
relatively favorable terms throughout the year. Over 35 per
cent of the total amount borrowed in 1982 was
denominated in Japanese yen, consisting of two public
bond issues in Japan in March and September, each for ¥20
billion; a direct borrowing of ¥20 billion in May provided by a

public bond issue in July in the international capital
markets outside Japan and the United States for ¥15 billion.

For the flrst time the Bank made three public bond Issues
In one year In the German capital market. These issues,
floated In April, August and November, were each for
DM 150 mililon.

The Bank again made two public bond issues in the
Swiss capital market where interest rates were comparatively low, These Issues, in May and August, were each
for SwF100 million.

in April, Two-Year US Dollar Bonds totalling $68 million
were piaced with central banks and monetary authorities in
27 member countries, replacing the maturing Two-Year US
Doilar Bonds of 1980. :

The Bank was again able to tap funds from oil exporting
countries for the benefit of its DMCs by making a private
placement in the Middle East. The placement, with the
Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, was for SwF75 miilion.

The average maturity of the year's borrowings, weighted
by amount, was 8.93 years, which had the effect of increasing the average life of outstanding borrowings from 7.03
years at the end of 1981 to 7.41 years at the end of 1982.

investments

At the end of 1982, the Bank’s OCR investments were
denominated in 23 currencies and amounted to the
equivalent of $1,957.3 million ($1,670.1 million at the end of‘cranes iimee igen cyan ects percent Sno re PRR et

1981), including investments of Special Reserve Fund
assets. Of the total investments, 61.1 per cent (28.4 per cent
at the end of 1981) was held in securities issued or
guaranteed by member governments, obligations of other
multilateral development banks and of approved government agencies of member countries. The remainder was invested in time deposits and certificates of deposit of banks
in member countries and the Bank for International Settlements. The average yield on the Bank's OCR investments
over the year increased to 11.42 per cent from 10.56 per cent
in 1981.

BORROWINGS, 1982

In September, the Board approved revised investment
guidelines, designed to improve the Bank's flexibility tn
balancing liquidity and income objectives. The major
changes included (i) allowing the Bank to invest in a wider
range of obligations; (ii) extending the permissible maximum maturity of investment securities; (iii) limiting the
Bank's investments in each of several classes of investments; {iv) extending the general limitation on the investment maturity and range of bank-related investments,
and (v) providing a more flexible guideline tor investment in
bank obligations.

Lending Rate

An interim review of the Bank’s lending rate was undertaken early in the year. On the basis of this review, the lending rate was increased from 10.10 per cent per annum to
11.00 per cent per annum with effect from t January 1982.
The annual review of the lending rate was undertaken in
August. As a result of this review the Board decided to retain the lending rate unchanged at 11.00 per cent per
annum.

Exchange Risk Pooling System

tn August 1981, the Board of Directors approved the
adoption by the Bank of an Exchange Risk Pooling System
to equalize the exchange risk among the borrowers in
respect of currencies repayable under loans financed from
the Bank's ordinary capital resources. Preparatory work on
the implementation of the system has been proceeding
satisfactorily and the system was introduced from 1
January 1983.

Loan Disbursements and Repayments

Disbursements from ordinary capital resources during
the year amounted io $619.6 million, bringing cumulative
disbursements from this source up to the end of 1982 to
$3,442.2 million. Repayments in 1982 totailed $148.0
million, consisting of $146.7 milllon on joans held by the
Bank and $1.3 million on portions of loans solid to participants. Cumulative loan repayments up to the end of
1982 reached $656.1 million, consisting of $638.1 million on
loans held by the Bank and $17.0 mitlion on portions sold
to participants.

Income and Expenses

The Bank's gross Income in 1982 was $413.7 million, an
increase of $66.6 million or 19.2 per cent over the $347.4
million gross income figure in 1981. The increase was due
mainly to a rise in income from loans and income from investments by $22.4 million and $43.6 million, respectively.

Reserves

The Bank’s Ordinary Reserve rose from $512.0 million as
of 34 December 1981 to $665.7 million as of 31 December

1982. The increase was due to (i) the transfer to the Ordinary Reserve of the accumulated net income as of 31.
December 1981 amounting to $139.7 million; and {ii} the net
credit to Ordinary Reserve amounting to $14.0 million consequent to the restatement of the Bank’s capital stock for
purposes of the Bank’s financial statements in terms of the
SDR.

The Special Reserve increased from $99.9 million as of 31
December 1981 to $123.3 million as of 31 December 1982 as
a result of appropriations of commissions earned on loans
during the year.

79SPECIAL FUNDS

Major Developments in 1982

DURING 1982, negotiations were concluded for a third
Asian Development Fund replenishment (ADF IV) to finance
the Bank's concessional lending program over the four-year
period 1983-1986. The developed member countries agreed
to provide a total of about $3,205 million, whiie a further

* $9.5 milion was agreed to be provided by four developing
member countries.

The fourth instalments of unqualified contributions to
the second Asian Development Fund replenishment (ADF
\} became available to the Bank for loan commitments in
February foliowing receipt of the third instalment of the
United States contribution. The fourth instaiment of the
U.S. contribution was received by the Bank in December.

During the year, the Bank also received further payments
totalling $18.6 million from the United States towards the
balance of its contribution to the first Asian Development
Fund replenishment (ADF !}). These payments reduced the
outstanding balance of the U.S. contribution to ADF Il to
$37.2 million.

During 1982, Indonesia made its first contribution to the
Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF} and iurther contributions were made by 11 other member countries.

Third ADF Replenishment (ADF IV)

During the year, the Bank successfully concluded
negotiations with ADF donor countries for a third Asian
Development Fund replenishment (ADF IV} to finance its
projected concessional fending program for Its poorer
developing member countries over the four-year period
1983-1986. The negotiations had commenced in 1981 when
formal meetings aitended by representatives of all 17
developed mernber countries were held in Geneva and
Canberra. Further meetings were held in 1982, in Paris,
Washington D.C, and Manila. The meetings were all chaired
by Sir John Chadwick. Special Adviser to the President of
the Bank. Although the Bank's initial replenishment target
of $4.1 billion was broadly supported at these meetings, the
economic and financial difficulties facing donor countries
made it necessary for the replenishment target to be re
vised. The level finally agreed on by the developed member
countries was about $3,205 million (at the average of daily
exchange rates during the first quarter of 1982).* In addition, four developing. member countries, namely, Republic
of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Repubiic of Korea,
agreed to make contributions totalling $9.5 million to the
replenishment.

Resolution No. 154, authorizing the Bank fo receive contributions to ADF IV in accordance with the terms and conditions thai had been agreed on, was adopted by the Board
of Governors in July, The Resolution provides that in order
for the replenishment arrangements to become effective,
the Bank would have to receive unqualified contribution
commitments from developed member countries totalling
at least $1.6 billion. The target date specified for this purpose ts 31 May 1983. The Resolution envisages that contributions would become available for loan commitments in
four equal annua! instalments over the period 1983-1986. As
of 31 December 1982, instruments of Contribution to the
teplenishment had been received from Republic of China,
Denmark and Republic of Korea.

Second ADF Replenishment (ADF iI!)

The second ADF replenishment (ADF iil} was authorized
by Governors’ Resolution No. 121, adopted in July 1978, to
cover the Bank’s concessional lending program over the
four-year period 1979-1982. The total amount authorized
was $2,159 million (at 1 April 1978 exchange rates), to be
released to the Bank for loan commitments in four equal
annual instalments over the replenishment period. At the
beginning of 1982, the third instalment of the United States
contribution became available to the Bank for loan commitments. Although the amount of the instalment was $3
million short of the fuil $111.25 million required by Resotution No. 121, the Board of Directors, pursuant to the provisions of the Resolution, agreed to the release of the fourth
instalments of the other contributions. Such release

Bank. By the end of the year, therefore, contribution commitments for the full amount of ADF {Il, except for the $3
million balance of the U.S. third instalment, had been
received by the Bank.

Resolution No. 121 requires that payments of ADF lil
contributions should be completed by 31 December 1982.
As of that date, the $3 million balance of the United States
third instalment was still outstanding together with the
fourth instalment payment of Canada. The Board of Directors therefore recommended that the Board of Governors
approve an extension of the final payment date to 31
December 1983.’

First ADF Replenishment (ADF 1)

The Bank was authorized to receive contributions to the
first ADF replenishment (ADF 1I) by Governors’ Resolution
No. 92, as amended, to finance its concessional lending
program over the three-year period 1976-1978. By the end of
4978 unqualified contribution commitments to ADF {! had
reached $701 million with the last $60 million of the United
States contribution still to come. Of this amount, the
United States paid $3.5 million in January 1981, $7.8 million
in January 1982 and $10.7 million in December 1982. The
outstanding balance of the contribution at the end of 1982
was therefore $37.9 milllon, The deadline for payment of the
U.S. contribution was extended by Governors’ Resolution
No. 145, adopted in October 1981. The Resolution provides
that the Governors will flx the final date for payment when
the United States Government informs the Bank of a new
payment ‘schedule. .

Availability and Utilization of ADF Resources

At the beginning of 1982, the net ADF resources availabie
for concessional loan commitments, after allowing a provision for exchange rate fluctuations, was about $90 million.
During the year, additional resources of $647 million
became available under ADF fi! and ADF Ill. In addition, net
income accrued ta ADF amounting to about $29 million.
However, principally because of changes during 1982 in the
values of some of the major contributors’ national currencies against the United States dollar, the net increase in the
value of resources available for loan commitments was only $404 million, The net amount available for loan commitments in 1982 was, therefore, $494 million.

During the final quarter, in view of the continuing
strength of the United States dollar against the currencies
of other ADF contributors, it seemed possible that
available ADF resources would prove insufficient to cover
the full concessionat lending program for the year. Consequently, during December the Board of Directors approved
three loans totalling $85.9 miliion subject to the condition
that they would be signed only after the necessary
resources became available.2 New concessional loans approved during the year, including loans conditionally ap

proved, totalled $546 million. After allowance for cancellations, repayments and exchange rate adjustments, net loan
commitments during the year amounted to $476 million.
The net resources available for further loan commitments
at the end of the year were, therefore, $18 mitlion.

As of 31 December 1982 the cumulative amount of net
foan commitments was $3,404 million. Disbursements from
ADF resources during 1982 amounted to $175.5 million,
bringing total cumulative disbursements to $1,062.4
million. Repayments during the year and cumulative
repayments up to the end of the year amounted to $11.4
million and $51.9 million, respectively.

Denomination of Loans in SDR

In December, the Board of Directors reviewed the Bank's
practice of denominating ADF loans in terms of the U.S.
dollar. it was noted that this practice had caused difficulties and uncertainties to the Bank in matching ADF
loan commitments with ADF resources availabie to cover
such {oan commitments, because ADF resources, consisting of various currencies, fluctuated in value in terms of
the U.S. dollar depending on exchange rate movements.
The Board decided, therefore, that. in order to significantly
reduce fluctuations between ADF resources end ADF loan
commitments and to overcome these difficulties and uncertainties, ADF loans to be negotiated after 1 January 1983
would be denominated in ierms of the SDR.

Organization

A new Co-Financing Unit was established In the Country
Department In line with the Bank's new emphasis on promoting Its co-flnancing actlvitles. The Country Department
itself was reorganized to strengthen country economic and
program work with the redistributlon of DMCs from seven

into six Country Divisions. The Bank's first Resident Office
was established in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with a view to
facilitating ihe Bank’s operations in that country.

The diversificatlon and volume of activities such as
education, urban planning and health in the Infrastructure
Departmen led to the bifurcation of the Social Infrastructure Division and the creation of a separate Education
Division.

A Financial Policy Division, headed by a Financial Advisor, was established in the Treasurer's Department to
devote full-time attention to fInancial policy and financial
planning and management functions and to coordinate
work on capital increases, Special Fund replenishments
and related matters as well as on financial issues of a
general nature. The responsibility for coordinating financial
policies was transferred to this Division trom the Controller’s Department. The Securities Division and the
Finance Division were restructured by merging borrowing
and investment functions undar a Treasury Operations Division and by grouping back-office and international payment functions under a combined Treasury Services
Division.

The Coordinator of Spectal Projects and his staff were
separated from the Office of Administrative Services and
established as a separate Special Projects Office to coordinate the Bank's new Headquarters Buliding and Staff
Housing projects. The responsibilities of the Information
Office were also broadened to include a wider range of
public relations, internal communications and audio-visual
activities.

" Special Activities

{nternal Audit: Internal auditing provides Management
with periodic, independent and objective evaluation of the
adequacy and effectiveness of managerial controls and

related systems and procedures in the financial, account:

ing, administrative functions and loan and technical
assistance and data processing activities of the Bank, The
overall objective is to assist Heads of Departments and Offices and Managers at other levels in the effective
discharge of their responsibilities. The internal Audit Office
{IAO) reports to the President.

The resuits of audits, comprising findings, analyses, conclusions and recommendations, are conveyed to Management and departments or offices concerned by separate
report, for information and action as appropriate. Copies of
such audit reports are also conveyed to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which may review selected
reports with the representative of the [AO and/or departments or offices concerned. The Audit Committee also
reviews the status of implementation of [AO’s recommendations and {AO’s annual work program.

in performing the audits, the IAQ examines and
evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of management
controls, the reliability and integrity of financial and
operating information, the adequacy of safeguards for the
Bank's resources — funds, property and personnel — and
the economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of
such resources. The IAO aiso reviews the extent of compliance with the Bank's policies, guidelines. systems, procedures and agreements, including the adequacy and effectiveness of controls inherent in the computer environment, It reviews and tests computer systems which are
operational and/or in the process of conversion from
manuai systems.

Recently, [AO’s involvement in the Bank's toan project
operations has included reviews of compliance with provisions in loan covenants, evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls over joan income on
disbursements, and participation in the Bank’s review missions. increased IAO attention was placed on audits for
achieving economy and efficiency and on computer
systems review and testing of computer systems which are
operational or in the process of conversion from the existing system. A major initiative has been taken to
strengthen and enhance the efficiency of JAO with the
preparation of a comprehensive and up-to-date audit
manual.

Computer and Office Automation Programs: During
the year, considerable progress was made in implamenting
the Bank’s computer program. The initial establishment of
the Bank's central data base was completed and a number
of computer applications were implemented in the areas of
lending, accounting and finance, and administrative
management. An intensive program of staff training was
carried out and computer terminals were installed in
various user areas for direct input to and information
retrieval from the data base. Severai computer programs
are operational on the main computer and on
microprocessors which will meet the analytical and
statistical needs of Bank staff in project appraisal, financial analysis, economic evaluation, personnel management
and forecasting and financial projections.

presented to the Board in January. During the second haif
of the year, 20 word processors were instalied in various
Bank units. After extensive training of Bank staff, the word
processors were brought into use in the Bank’s operations.
in 1983, the computer facility will be ennanced to achieve
productivity improvement in computer operations, better
service through the use of microprocessors, word processors, computer terminals and graphics facilities. Future
plans include increased activities in the areas of program
maintenance, data base administration, network control
and somputer operations. The progressive introduction of
office automation and computer-based information
systems will result in greater work efficiency and better
management information for the Bank's operations.

Research: The focus of the Bank’s research activities during 1882 was on analysis of major economic
issues for DMCs during the 1980s, review and analysis of

89current socio-economic developments in the DMCs,
strengthening the economic evaluation methodology in
project appralsal and improvements to the quality and
coverage of statistical data compiled by the Bank.

A large number of studles in the flelds of domestic and
external resource mobilization; medium and small-scale industries; trade and external debt; energy; economic
forecasting and methodologies for economic evaiuation of
projects were completed during the year. Most were
published for clrculation, either as Asian Development
Bank Economic Staff Papers or as Economics Office
Reports. Gonsiderable work was also done for the launching — early in 1983 — of a new publication entitled Asian
Development Review. A new format was also devised for
the Key indicators of the Developing Member Countries of
ADB.

Bank staff also attended several national and international seminars on economic development issues during
the year.

MAINTAINING the serviceability of low-lift pumps which
are crucial for the mechanical irrigation of fields in the dry
season is the major objective of the Low-Lift Pump
Maintenance Program in Bangladesh, for which the Bank
approved its first program loan in 1978.

 

Office Accommodation

In view of the anticipated delay in the availability of the
Bank's new Headquarters building (now envisaged in 1987),
ihe Bank during the year reviewed its office space needs for
the period 1983-1987. Preliminary findings indicated a need
to rent considerable additional office space as an interim
measure. A more detailed assessment of the requirements
up to 1987 will be completed dusing 1983. Such assessment
will take into consideration the additional space required to
prevent further fragmentation of departments and offices,
to relocate dispersed units in one building and to accommodate the Bank's ongoing computerization and office
automation programs.

New Headquarters Building

While appraisal of the joint Bank-Philippine Government
Headquarters building project in the proposed Financial
Center Complex (FCC) was being completed, the Govern:
ment Informed the Bank in mid-1982 of the need to limit fts
financial involvement in the project. The Government inGicated, however, that it would support the Bank In any efforts to construct ihe’bullding on another site. Consequentty, construction of the new Headquarters building on
another site was evaluated in comparison with the original
FCC project. The Board of Directors is expected to consider
the alternative site proposal early in 1983 to determine the
basis for proceeding with the project.

Staff

On 31 December 1982, the Bank's staff had reached a
toiai of 1,379 from 33 member countries. Of these, 517
belonged to the professional staff category and 862 to the
supporting staff category. There were 79 professional staff
appointments during the year, while 30 staff terminated
thelr appointments with the Bank. {n the supporting staff
category, 102 appointments were made and 29 staff resigned. Due to satisfactory progress in recruitment in 1982,
the Bank Is, for the first time in five years, very close to being fully staffed.

The annual review of staff salaries and benefits was condusted in the second half of the year. In order to keep staff
salaries In line with the rising cost of living and to maintain
fhe competitiveness of Bank compensation vis-a-vis com:
parable organizations, the Board of Directors approved
genera! salary increases for professional staff and supporting staff, effective 1 August.

During 1982, work on a number of programs initiated in
previous years to strengthen and improve the Bank's personnel management was continued or completed.
Foremost among these was the comprehensive review of
the Bank’s professional staff compensation systems which
had been conducted over a two-year period with the
assistance of management consultants. This study involved analyses of the structure and relationships among
professional staff positions, the effectiveness of the
Bank's salary practices in terms of external competitiveness and internal equity and abillty to motivate high
performance, and the adequacy and impact of the Bank's
allowances and benefits. The policy guldelines and programs developed in the course of this study are intended to
provide a systematic and integrated iong-term basis for attracting, motivating, developing and retaining the highlyPORT facilities at Honiara, Solomon islands, have been
expanded and improved with the help of a Bank loan,
substantially increasing the cargo-handling capacity of
this South Pacific istand DMC.

qualified professional staff needed to carry out the Bank's
programs during the remainder of the 1880s.

The central component of these programs is a new position evaluation system and related ten-ievel classification
structure which restructure professional stafi positions on
the basis of consistent Bank-wide assessments of job content and the relative worth of jobs. Conversion to the new
system and to the corresponding ten-level salary structure,
approved by the Board with effect from 1 May 1982, was initiated in September.

Based on the compensation study, the Board also approved significant changes in a number of professional
staff allowances and benefits. These changes had the
general objectives of encouraging longer service, maintaining international competitiveness and compensating for
specific cosis associated with the Bank's location.

With respect to other aspects of staff compensation,
agreement was reached: during 1982 on a pension
transferability agreement with the World Bank; employing
this arrangement as a iramework, negotiations for similar
agreements will now be undertaken with other international
institutions.

The implementation of the professional staff position
classification program (together with the earlier implementation of a comparable supporting staff system) provides
an improved framework for other personnel management
programs and activities on which developmental work continued during 1982. These include the design of manpower
planning systems intended to correlate program plans with
budgetary and staffing resources and requirements and to
support planning for recruitment, training and development, individual career paths and succession. The initial
portion of this system. a computerized personnel management information system, became operational in late 1982.

In 1982, substantial progress was also made.in staff
training, where an expanded program of internal and external workshops and seminars focused on Bank policies and
procedures and technical aspects of project evaluation
was designed and impiemented.

Staff Housing Scheme

The Bank's rental assistance scheme continued in force
during the year. A long-term solution to the housing problems of professional staff through a Bank-financed program of constructing housing and associated facilities for
lease to staff gained further progress with the signing in
mid-1982 of an agreement with the Philippine Government
confirming the Bank's right to own land for construction of
staff housing. A proposal for a staff housing scheme was
presented for Board consideration in November 1982. The
Board expressed agreement in principle with the proposal
but suggested a scaling down of the overall size of the
scheme. A revised proposal will be submitted for Board
consideration after a decision has been taken on the site of
the new Headquarters building.

Budget

Internal Administrative Expenses for 1982 amounted to
$62,749,716 against the original Budget of $68,585,000,
representing 21.5 per cent utilization of the fatter. The
underrun of $5,835,284 against the Budget is due mainly to
savings in staff salaries and relocation on account of lower
number of staff appointments, lower than projected professional staff general salary increase and economies effected in staff consultants and business travel.

The Administrative Budget for 1983, which was approved
on 22 December 1982, is summarized in Appendix 2. It provides for internal Administrative Expenses in 1983 amount
ing to $77,524,000, an increase of $14.8 million over actual
expenses in 1982, The increase is attributable largely to: {i}
additional staff required for ongoing and new activities programmed in 1983 and arising from positions which couid
not be filled in 1982; {ii) salary and benefit improvements
approved in 1982 and further improvements subject to consideration in 1983; {iii} increased business travel and additional overheads including office occupancy, contractual
services, depreciation, etc., required to support the Bank's
functions; and (iv) past and prospective price escalation.

Commitments for Services to Member Countries in 1982
amounted to $12,925,300, representing 99 per cent utilization of the budget of $13,000,000 and an increase of 85 per
cent over actuai commitments of $6,986,100 in 1981. Provision is made in 1983 for new commitments amounting to
$19,000,000, representing an increase of 47 per cent over
the actual commitments in 1982.aes

ie i ig i

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of members are functional currencles. The reporting currency is the United States
dollar, and the flnancial statements are expressed in
thousands of current United States dollars.

Capltal Stock

The capital stock is defined in Article 4, paragraph 1
of the Articles of Agreement ‘in terms of United
States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on
31 January 4986” (the 1966 dollar). The capltal stock
had historically been transtated into the current
Unlted States dollar (the Bank’s unit of account}, on
the basis of Its par value In terms of gold. From 1973
until 31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on this basis
was $1.20635 per 1966 dollar. Since 4 April 1978, at
which time the Second Amendment to the Articles of
Agreement of the Internatlonal Monetary Fund (IMF)
came Into effect, currencles no longer have par
values in terms of gold. The Bank is examining the
implications of this change on the vafuation of its
capltai stock but has not mada a decision on the matter. Pending such a decision, the Bank’s capital
stock has been valued for purposes of the accompanying financlal statements in terms of the Special
Drawing Right (SDR), at the value in current United
States dollars as computed by the IMF. As of 314
December 1982, the SDR was valued at $1.10311. (See
Note D. This note also shows what the vaiue of the
Bank’s capital stock wauld be If expressed in terms
of $1.20635 per 1986 dollar.)

Translation of Currencies

  

Assets and liabilities are translated from their functlonal currencies to the reporting currency generaily
at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a
reporting period. income and expense amounts are
translated for each quarter generalty at the rates of
exchange at the beginning of the quarter; such practlce approximates the application of average rates in
effect during the quarter. Translation adjustments,
other than those relating to maintenance of value of
currency holdings under Article 25 (see Note E) and
“Notional amounts required to maintain vaiue of currency holdings''{see Note F}, are charged or credited
to “Accumulated transtation adjustments”. Exchange gains or losses on currency transactions
among functional currencies are included in Income.

Loans

The Summary Statement of Loans (Appendix 1-IV)
presents, by country, total approved loans to be
financed from ordinary capital resources. Adjustments for loans not yet effective, refundings and
cancellations, payments received, loans agreed to be sold and translation adjustments are made to arrive
at effective loans.

$463,000 — 1981). Gains and losses on sales of investments are measured by the difference between
average amortized cost and the net proceeds of
sales. The annualized rate of return on the average
investments held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the end of each quarter, including realized gains and losses, was 11.42% (10.56% — 1981).

CAPITAL STOCK —

The authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of
722,057 shares, of which 716,037 shares have been
subscribed by members, Of the subscribed shares,
576,864 are “callable” and 139,173 are “paid-in”. The
“gailabte” share capital is subject to call by the Bank
only as and when required to meet the Bank’s obligations incurred on borrowings or on guarantees. The
“paid-in” share capital is payable or has been paid in
instalments, partly in convertible currencies and
partly in the currency of the subscribing member. In
accordance with Article 6, paragraph 3 of the Ar
ticles, the Bank accepts non-negotiable, noninterest-bearing demand obligations in satisfaction
of the portion payable in the currency of the member,

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ~ ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1982 and 31 December 1981

 

provided such currency is not required by the Bank
for the conduct of its operations.

In the Articles, the Bank's capital stock is deflned ‘In
terms of United States dollars of the weight and
fineness in effect on 31 January 1866”, and the value
of each share of stock Is defined as belng 10,000
1966 dollars. On 7 Apri! 1978, the Second Amendment
to the IMF Articles entered Into force, under which
gold has been abolished as a common denominator
of the international monetary system, currencles no
longer have par values, and ali caicuiatfons for the
purposes of the [MF Articies are made on the basis of
the SDR. Simultaneously, the provision of United
States jaw defining the par value of the United States
dollar In terms of gold was repealed, As a2 result of
these changes, the pre-existing basis for translating
the term "United States dollars of the weight and
fineness in effect on 31 January 1966” Into current
United States dollars, or Into any other currency, no
longer exists.

The Bank Is considering a proposal that Its capital
stock be redefined in terms of the SDR. A member
government has ralsed the question whether the
subsiftutlon of a new unit of value, Insofar as It
would give rise to any new obligations with respect
to maintenance of value and capital stock subseriptlon payments, should be made only by amendment
of the Articles. This member has also ralsed questions as to the appropriateness of substituting a unit
of value other than the SDR, the deslrabitity of retainIng the principle of maintenance of value, and the
form In which maintenance of value should be appiled.

The General Counsel of the Bank {ts of the opinion
that the SDR is the successor in the International
monetary system to the gold-based dollar, and that

pending the exercise by the appropriate authorities
of the Bank of their statutory powers under Chapter
IX of the Articles, references In the Articles to the
1966 dollar should be read as referring to the SDR as
defined from ilme to time by the IMF, In view of this,
and pending consideration and actlon on the issues
referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Bank has
for purposes of these flnanctai statements expressed the value of its capltal stock In terms of the SDR,
on the basis that each share has the value of SDR
10,000, For purposes of these financial statements, it
has also measured the mutual obligations of each
member and of the Bank with respect to
maintenance of value of currency holdings by that
standard. However, the appropriate authorltles of the
Bank could decide that the value of each share
should be fixed at $12,063.50, on the basis of a
substitutlon of 1.20635 current United States dollars
for each 4966 dollar.

When the SDR was Introduced into the IMF Articles
in 1988, It was expressed In terms of a specified
weight of gold equal to the gold content of the 1966
dollar. Since 1 July 1974, its value has been based on
the welghted relative values of a number of major
currencles (a “currency basket”). On 1 July 1974, the
value of the SDR, expressed in terms of United States
dollars was $1.20635, namely the same value as the
1966 dollar, but subsequently the value in current
monetary terms has varied from day to day. Effective
4 July 1978, the IMF made certain adjustments in the
SDR currency basket, and established a method for
further adjustments ai five-yearly intervals, to reftect
changes In the relative Importance of currencies over
time, while’ ensuring continuity and reasonable
predictability for the valuation of the SDR, The iMF
further revised the currency basket effective 1
January 1981 by reducing the number of currencies
from 16 to 5. The adjustments made at the time of theAPPENDIX 7-V1

CONTINUED

 

changes were such that the value of the revised
baskets in terms of any currency was exactly the
same under both the then existing and the revised
vajuations. As of 31 December 1982, the value of the
SDR in terms of the United States doliar was

$1.10311 giving a value for each share of the Bank’s

capital equivalent to $11,031.10.

If the capital stock as of 31 December 1982 had been
valued in terms of $12,063.50 per share, the
“callable"capital subscribed would have been
$6,958,999,000 ($6,924,039,000 — 1981) instead of
$6,363,444,000 ($6,680,735,000 — +981), the “paid-in”
capital subscribed would have been $1,678,913,000
($1,674,908,000 —1981) instead of $1,535,232,000
($1,618,053,000 —1981), the total subscribed capital
would have been $8,637,912,000 ($8,598,947,000 —
1981) instead of $7,898,676,000 ($8,296,788,000 —

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencles of contributing members are func:
tional currencles. The reporting currency is the
Unlied States dollar, and the financial statements
are expressed In thousands of current United States
doilars.

{b}  Transtation of Currencies

Assets and liabilities are transiated from their functional currencies to the reporting currency generally
at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a
reporting perlod. Income and expense amounts are
translated for each quarter generally at the rates of
exchange at the beginning of the quarter; such practice approximates the application of average rates in
effect during the quarter. Translation adjustments
relating to contributions are offset by increases or
decreases in the contribution accounts. Translation
adjustments relating to capital set-aside are recorded as receivable from or payable to ordinary capitai
resources. Other translation adjustments are
charged or credited to “Accumulated translation adjustments”. Exchange gains or losses on currency
transactions are included in income.{c) Contributions
Contributions by member countries are inciuded in
the financial statements as amounts committed from
the date instruments of Contribution are deposited
and related formalities are completed.

NOTE 3 —

INVESTMENTS

  

 

As of 31 December 1982, the market vaiue of in
vestments was $443,538,000 ($392,935,000 — 1981),
including investments not traded In the market which
were valued at their cost or amortized cost of
$317,659,000 ($228,593,000 — 198%). During the year
ended 31 December 1982, sales of investments
resulted in a net gain of $365,000 ($47,000 — 1981).
Gains and losses on sales of investments are
measured by the difference between average amortized cost and the net proceeds of sales. The annualized rate of return on the average investments
held during the year, based on the portfolio held at
the end of each quarter, including realized gains and
losses, was 11.17% {10.62% — 1981).

NOTE 4 —.

.LOANS®

The Summary Statement of Loans (Appendix 1-4)
presents, by country, total approved loans to be
financed from the Fund. Adjustments for loans not
yet effective, refundings and cancellations,
payments received and transiation adjustments are
made to arrive at effective loans.

NOTE 5 —

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND
ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

Administrative expenses include Administration
Charge to Special Operations amounting te
$27,410,000 ($25, 1 18,00 — 1981). The Administration
Charge to Special Operations is presently based ona

 

 

APPENDIX 7-6

formula which takes into consideration all administrative expenses (other than these appertaining
directly to ordinary operations and special operations) and the number of joans approved.

NOTE 6 —

SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph
(i), the Board of Governors fas authorized the setting aside of 10 per cent of the unimpaired
“paid-in” capital paid by members pursuant to Article
6, paragraph 2{a) and the convertible currency portion paid by members pursuant to Article 6,
paragraph 2(b) as of 28 April 1973, to be used as part
of the Special Funds of the Bank, The capital so set
aside was allocated and transferred trom the ordinary capital resources to the Fund as Set-Aside
Resources.

The capital stock of the Bank is defined in Article 4,
paragraph 1 of the Artictes of Agreement “in terms of
United States dollars of the weight and fineness in
effect on 31 January 1966" (the 1966 dollar).

~ Therefore, Set-Aside Resources had historically been

transiated into the current United States dollar (the
Bank’s unit of account), on the basis of its par value
in terms of gold, From 1973 untit 31 March 1978, the
rate arrived at on this basis was $1.20635 per 1866
dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at which time the Second
Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect, currencies no longer have par values in terms of gold.
The Bank is examining the implications of this
change on the vaiuation of its capital stock but has
not made a decision on the maiter. Pending such 2
decision, the Set-Aside Resources has been valued
for purposes of the accompanying financial
statements in terms of the Special Drawing Right
(SDR), at the value in current United States dollars as
computed by the IMF. As of 31 December 1982, the
SDR was valued at $1.10311, On this basis, Set-Aside
Resources amounted to $52,519,000. If the capital
stock as of 31 December 1982 had been valued in
terms of $12,063.50 per share, Set-Aside Resources
would have been $57,434,000.

NOTE 1 —

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a)

(b)

{c)

Functional Currency and Reporting Currency

The functional currency of the Technical Assistance
Special Fund (TASF) ls deemed, as a matter of convenience, to be the same as the reporting currency, the
United States dollar. The financial statements of
TASF are expressed in thousands of current United
States doilars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, tlabilitles and unexpended balances In currencias other than Unlted States dollars are
translated at the applicable rates of exchange at the
and of the year,

income and expense amounis In currencies other
than United States dollars are transiated for each
quarter generally at the applicabie rates of exchange
at the begInaing of the quarter; such practice approxImates the application of average rates in effect during the quarter.

Transiatlon adjustments are accounted for as exchangs gains or losses and are charged or credited
to operations.

Contributions

Contributions by member countries are included In
the flnancial statements as amounts committed from
the date contribution agreements become effective.
As to those member countries which have agreed to
consider specific requests for financing, the
amounts shown in the financial statements as
amounts committed are based on the specific requests approved at the end of the year.

NOTE 2 —

INVESTMENTS

an

As of 31 December 1982, the market value of investments was $15,151,000 ($15,666,000 — 1981), in
cluding investments not traded in the market which
were valued at their cost or amortized cost of
$11,396,000 ($7,576,000 — 1981). During the year ended 31 December 1982, sales of investments resulted
in a net gain of $1,000 ($4,000 — 1981). Gains and
josses on sales of Investments are measured by the
difference between average amortized cost and the
net proceeds of sales. The annualized rate of return
on the average investments held during the year,
based on the portfolio held at the end of each
quarter, Including realized gains and losses, was
8.58% (8.46% — 1981).

NOTE 3 —

FUNDING

Since 1967, contributions have been made by 25
(24-1981) member countries. In most cases, the initial
use of the contributions has been restricted to the
procurement of services and facilities from the conirlbuting member country. There has been a trend
towards Ilberalization of the procurement terms,
however, and many subsequent contributions and
portions of the unexpended balances are substantially or wholly unrestricted.

NOTE 4 —

SERVICES TO MEMBER COUNTRIES

The Bank’s outstanding commitments for technical
assistance projects and programs totailed approximately $17,015,000 as of 31 December 1982
($11,748,060 — 1981}; to the extent available, contributions to the TASF may be used to meet expenditures arising out of the commitments. The amount
shown js exclusive of technical assistance services
made avallable on a reimbursable basis; however,
when technical assistance rendered as a part of the
commitment shown leads to loans for specific projects, the portion representing the cost of design and
engineering and any remaining balance over
$150,000 will be converted to the subsequent loan.
Under such options, technical assistance expenditures of $337,000 {nil-1981) were charged to loans
and credited to income from other sources of the
TASF during the year ended 31 December 1982.DELOITTE HASKINS & SELLS

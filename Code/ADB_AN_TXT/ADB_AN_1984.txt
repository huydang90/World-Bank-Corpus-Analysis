The Asian Development Bank

 

The Asian Development Bank, an international partnership of 45 member nations, is
engaged in promoting.the economic and social progress of its developing member countries
in the Asia-Pacific region.

The Bank started functioning in December 1966 with its Headquarters in Manila, Philippines. it is owned by the governments of 31 countries from the Asia-Pacific region and 14
countries from Europe and North America.

in 18 years of operations, the Bank has become a major catalyst in promoting the
+development of the mosi populous and fastest growing region in the world today. The Bank’s
principal functions are {i) to make loans for the economic and social advancement of developing member countries; (ii) to provide technical assistance for the preparation and execution of
development projects and programs and advisory services; (iii) to promote investment of
public and private capital for development purposes; and (iv) to respond to requests for
assistance in coordinating development policies and plans of member countries. In its operations, the Bank is atso required to give speciai attention to the needs of the smaller or less
developed countries and give priority to regional, sub-regional and national projects and programs which will contribute to the harmonious economic growth of the region as a whole.

The financial resources of the Bank consist of ordinary capital resources, comprising
subscribed capital, reserves and funds raised through borrowings; and Special Funds, comprising contributions made by member countries and amounts previously set aside from the
paid-in capitat. Loans from ordinary capital resources, which account for aimost 69 per cent of
Bank lending, are generally made to member countries which have attained a somewhat
higher level of economic development. Loans from Special Funds, which are administered in
‘the Asian Development Fund, are made almost exclusively to the poorest borrowing countries
on highly concessional terms.

The Bank has borrowed funds for its ordinary operations from the capital markets of
Europe, Japan, the Middle East and the United States. it has also sold two-year dollardenominated bonds to central banks or monetary authorities of its members. The Bank’s
callable caplial, which at the end of 1984 accounted for nearly 88 per cent of its subscribed
capital, backs its borrowings in the capital markets.

The Bank’s operations cover the entire spectrum of economic development, with particular emphasis on agriculture, rural development, energy and social infrastructure. Most
Bank financing is designed to support specific projects. In certain cases, the Bank atso provides program, sector and multiprojeci loans.

With the growing need for farger and more diversified inflows of capital to the region, the
Bank is actively expanding its co-financing activities, with official as well as commercial and
export credit sources. The Bank has also recentiy entered into equity investment operations.

The Bank’s highest policy-making body is its Board of Governors which meets annually.
The direction of the Bank’s generai operations is the responsibility of the Board of Directors —
composed of 12 Directors (each with an Alternate) — eight representing regional countries
and four representing non-regional countries. The Board of Governors conducts an election
for the Board of Directors every two years.

The President of the Bank is elected by the Board of Governors for a term of five years,
after which he may be re-elected. The President is Chairman of the Board of Directors and
under Its direction he conducts the business of the Bank. In this he is assisted by the VicePresidents, who are appointed by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the
President.

The Bank has 21 departments and offices — including a Resident Office in Dhaka,
Bangladesh, and a South Pacific Regional Office in Port Vila, Vanuatu — dealing with various
operational, financial, administrative and generai support functions.ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ©

Office of the President
7 March 1985

Dear Mr. Chairman:

In accordance with Article 39 of the
Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank and Section 13 of its By-Laws, |
submit to the Board of Governors the enclosed Annual Report of the Bank for 1984,
including a separate report on the activities
of the Special Funds of the Bank, which has
been prepared under the direction of the
Board of Directors. The Annual Report also
includes the financial statements prescribed
in Section 15 of the By-Laws.

Sincerely yours,

Meares P

MASAO FUJIOKA
President and
Chairman of the
Board of Directors

Chairman of the
Board of Governors
Asian Development BankTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

WHILE ail the powers of the Bank are vested in the Board
of Governors, it has delegated these powers to the Board of
Directors except for some which ate specifically reserved to
Governors. The responsibility for the direction of the Bank’s
general operations thus rests with the Board of Directors.
it meets in formal session under the chairmanship of the
President of the Bank about once a week on average, and
also meets informaily as often as.necessary.

The Bank’s policies are established and reviewed by the
Board of Directors within the general framework of the Bank’s
Charter. In 1984 the Board was particularly concerned to
ensure that existing policies were working weil and proving
sufficiently flexible to respond to the needs-of the Bank’s
developing member countries. In this regard, the Board examined the Bank's procurement procedures and decided to
streamline technical assistance and loan operations. It also
weicomed the President's measures within the Bank to
delegate more responsibility in operational activities, so as
to increase the Bank’s effectiveness in handling a growing
operational program. The Board hoped the measures might
also reduce to some extent the bunching in the last quarter
of the Board's consideration of loan proposais.

Having undertaken a major review of the Bank’s financial policies in 1983, the Board’s activity in this area in 1984
was limited. On its recommendation, Governors decided to
discontinue by stages the Bank's practice of charging a commission on its ordinary operations loans. The Board also
made certaln amendments to the guidelines for the investment of funds not currently needed in the Bank’s operations,
These amendments were designed to give greater flexibility to the Treasurer in managing the Bank’s investment portfolio so as to maximize the return on its funds, subject to
considerations of security and liquidity.

The Board completed its review of the Bank’s operations
in Its South Pacific developing member countries and agreed
with Management’s recommendation that the Bank should
establish a South Pacific Regional Office in Port Vila,
Vanuatu. The Office was formally opened by the President

in August 1984, With adequate authority delegated to the Office, the Bank should be able to respond more effectively and
efficiently to the spectal needs of its South Pacific member
countries. s

The Board reviewed the status of the Bank’s Technical
Assistance Special Fund (TASP). It noted that, while contributions to the TASF In 1983 were considerably lower than in
1982, they had again increased in 1984. The Board agreed
to recommend that all member countries be invited to make
enhanced and untied contributions to the TASF on a regular
basis to ensure that sufficient resources would be available
to finance the growing demands for technical assistance
grants.

The Board examined the trends and prospects in the
Bank’s co-financing with official sources including governments and their agencies and other multilateral institutions.
it concluded that, while there was no need for any changes
in existing Bank policy or procedures, the Bank’s attitude
should be more clearly articulated in order to emphasize its
strong desire to promote such co-financing.

Recognizing the significant role which the private sector has to play in economic development, the Board gave further consideration to ways in which the Bank might encourage private enterprise in its developing member countries other than through equity investments.

In accordance with its continuing responsibility for the
Bank’s financiat and operating programs, the Board approved
borrowings totalling the equivalent of $971.7 mittion in 1984,
including the Bank’s first ever borrowing in pounds sterling.
it reviewed the Bank's fending rate, reducing it from 10.50
to 10.25 per cent from 1 July. it approved 58 proposals for
loans, technical assistance grants and equity investment.
The adverse impact of exchange rate movements, coupled
with arrears in Asian Development Fund (ADF) payments by
the United States and consequent reduced release of
resources by eight other donor countries limited the amount
of resources available for ADF loan commitments during the
year. This negative impact was partially offset by the voiun-tary release by 11 further donor countries of the full amounts
of the second tranches of their ADF IV contributions.
However, the net effect was that approval of six ADF loans
at the end of 1984 was made conditional on further ADF
resources becoming available in early 1985. At the Board’s
request, the President wrote to the Governor for the United
States to convey deep concern about the implications of a
possible shortage of resources for ADF lending in 1985 and
1986.

In other activities, the Board received raguias reports on
joan administration and technical assistance implementation, examined changes In the Bank's Investment portfolio
and considered varlous administrative matters, Including
Staff salaries and benefits. t approved proceeding with the
constructlon of a new Headquarters buliding in Maniia at a
total capital outlay of about $171 million. It considered and
approved the Administrative Budget for 1985 on the basis
of a report from its Budget Review Committee.

At its informai meetings the Board discussed a variety
of policy and other issues including requests by certain
member countries for special increases in their capital
subscriptions, possible change in the way the Bank presently
determines Its lending rate, the Bank’s operational program
for 1985-87 and the possible need to reorganize the operational departments of the Bank.

The Soard has found invaluable the pericdic visits which
small groups of Directors make to the Bank’s developing
member countries. Such visits enable Directors to see
something of the Bank’s operations at first hand and to hold
high-level policy discussions with Ministers, senior officials
and private business people. in 1984 visits were made to

Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in February and to Pakistan in
October.

The Board has found it useful to have three standing
committees, namely, the Audit Committee, the Budget
Review Committee and the Committee on Administrative
Matters Relating to Members of the Board.

The Audit Committee was established in 1977. During
1984, it reviewed the Bank's financlal statements and the
scope of the outside audit, considered various Internal audit
matters, and reviewed the activities of the Post-Evaiuation
Office, including 14 Project Performance Audit Reports and
three Special Studies. As enjoined by its terms of reference,
the Committee also advised the Board on the appointment
of Outside Auditors for 1985 and its recommendation was
adopted by the Board.

The Budget Review Committee was established in 1984
after a similar ad hoc Committee had operated for the
previous two years. It undartook a detalied review of the proposed 1985 Administrative Budget. The Committee's report
to the Board included a number of important recommendatlons designed to improve and reflne the Bank’s budgetary
procedures. The Board recommended their full and speedy
implementation to the President.

The Committee on Administrative Matters Relating to
Members of the Board (CAMB) was established in 1979. lis
main function is to advise the President and the Board on
matters of a policy or procedural nature relating to the services of Directors and Alternates. During 1984, the Committee, for example, started reviewing the provisions for travel
by Board members.

Special Fund,THE BANK IN 1984

THE Bank’s fending in 1984 reached $2,234 million, 18 per
cent above the 1983 figure of $1,893 million.

This increase reflected a number of factors, including the
stronger world economy and the more buoyant economic
conditions prevailing in many of the Bank’s developing
tember countries (DMCs). There was also the favorable
impact of more responsive Bank policies adopted in 1983 on
program lending, financing of local cost expenditure and
interest during construction and more flexible implementation of multiyear programming, In addition, a number of largesized projects were processed for approval in 1984.

The increase in overali Bank lending was accounted for
by a substantial (30 per cent) increase in loans from ordinary
capital resources (OCR) which rose to $1,551 million in 1984
from $1,190 million a year earlier. Loans from Special Funds
(SF), on the other hand, decreased slightly (by 2.7 per cent)
to $684 miliion from $703 million in 1983, mainly because of
significant falls in concessional iending to two DMCs —
Burma and, to a lesser degree, Nepal. Loans to other SF
borrowers increased by about 13 per cent. *

Other highlights:

* The Seventeenth Annual General Meeting of the Board
of Governors ‘was held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in

* Borrowings in the international capital markets totalled
$972 million, and included the Bank’s first pound sterling

The Bank approved loans for 47 projects in 1984, compared
with 53 a year earlier. In addition to the higher lending level,
there. was an increase in the average loan size -~ $45.6
miltion, compared with $34.4 million in #983 and only $24.3
million in 1980. During the year, the Bank extended ten loans
of over $80 million, inctuding five of $126 million or more,
compared with four loans of over $80 million in 1983,

The greater number of large-scale projects financed by the
Bank was also reflected In the significantly higher amount
of co-financing in 1984 which was more than double the

average of $494.5 million over the five-year period 1979-83.
Official sources provided $731 million in co-financing in
1984, compared with $128.4 miilion a year earlier, while their
share of total co-financing increased to 63 per cent from 42
per cent. Co-financing from commercial and export credit
sources also rose significantly, to $432 million in 1984 from
$180.4 million a year earlier, while their share of total
co-financing felt to 37 per cent from 58 per cent In 1983,

The pattern of Bank lending in 1984 was distinguished by
very sharp rises in the amount of loans channelled into the
€nergy and Transport and Communications sectors. On the
other hand, there were significant declines in lending for
Sociai Infrastructure and Development Banks.

Ona sectoral basis, Bank lending for Energy equaited that
for Agriculture in 1984. Together they accounted for over 68
per cent of all loans during the year.

Lending to the Energy sector amounted to $767 million (a
70 per cent increase over 1983), or 34.3 per cent of total
lending. This reflected the approval of loans for four large
energy projects amounting to $515.4 million, or 23.4 per cent
of total Bank jending.

The Bank continued to place emphasis on the development
of indigenous energy resources in its DMCs, a strategy which
it has been pursuing since the first oil crisis in 1973-74, Lending for hydropower, coal and natural gas projects increased
significantty during the year, while the diversification of

energy resources was the goal of several technical
assistance grants approved in 1984.

In the Agriculture sector, which accounted for $758 million
(17 per cent more than in 1983), or 33,9 per cent of the total,
the Bank continued to support projects designed to raise
food and commercial crop production in order to help improve the incomes and living standards of the rural population. Of particular note in this respect were two large loans
approved during the year — one for a project to drain a
waterlogged and salinized area of Sind Province in Pakistan,
and another to assist the Philippines to maintain food production in the face of its severe economic problems. As in
recent years, a very large proportion {about 46 per cent) of
all technical assistance was for agriculture projects.

The improvement of the quality of life and welfare of the
rural and urban population was also the primary goal of a
number of projects approved in the Social tnfrastructure
sector in 1984, Bank-supported water supply projects will
reduce the incidence of water-borne diseases and infant
mortality, while other projects will help provide the scientific,
technicat, clerical and managerial manpower needed to support economic and industria} development. Another project
will introduce wide-ranging improvements in the delivery of
health and population services in Pakistan.

Projects in the Transport and Communications sector, for
which Bank loans rose to $381 million in 1984 from $65 million
a year earlier, will benefit the rural poor in the form of
improved farm-to-market transportation, easier access to
schools and hospitals and better job opportunities.

Technical assistance for the preparation of projects, for
advisory and operational purposes and for regional activities
continued to play a major part in the Bank's developmenta!
Tole in 1984, although the total amount approved, at $22.1
million, was slightly less than the $25.3 million in 1983, The
important multiplier effect of technical assistance is underlined by the fact that as of the end of the year, 275 Bank ioan
projects amounting to $6.8 billion and involving an estimated
total investment cost of $17 billion had resuited from earlier
technical assistance amounting to $80 million.

ordinary loans, however, declined by nearly two per cent in
1984 because of budgetary constraints and resulting slower
project implementation in Malaysia and the Philippines, and
delays in contract awards in Indonesia.

During the year, the Bank made efforts to improve loan
administration through increased country project implementation review missions, various studies and analyses, and
the preparation of critical path networks for the computerassisted monitoring of individual projects. The Bank also took
steps to improve the processes and efficiency of procurement of goods and services by issuing mode! documents and
handbooks, and by holding instructional seminars for suppllers and contractors.

of further resources.

OUTLOOK: Reflecting the increasingly positive effects
of global economic recovery, most DMCs have resumed a
course of stronger economic growth. If the momentum is:to
be sustained, the DMCs will have to make greater efforts to
mobilize domestic and external resources. At the same time,
both DMC governments and aid donors will need to be
increasingly selective in allocating scarce resources between
competing demands and directing them to projects and programs that ensure their most efficient use,

was under process.coming years. Attention wiil be focused on optimum utilization of existing production capacities and the efficient
maintenance of prior investments. The Bank will also move
to strengthen the capability of DMC institutions to make
better use of their human, financial and other resources.
Policy dialogue between the Bank and DMC governments will
be intensified. Efforts to speed up loan and technical
‘assistance processing and to streamline loan administration
will continue.

The experience. of many DMCs shows that the private
sector can play a major roije in accelerating economic growth.
Besides its credit lines to DFls for oniending to small and
medium-scale enterprises and equity investments, the Bank
is considering new forms of assistance to the private sector.

While current projections cail for a rate of growth similar
to that in 1984, uncertainty exists over the level of Bank
lending during 1985. The level of concessional tending to the
poorer member countries will depend on the ADF resource
position. Moreover, budgetary and other restraints in certain
DMCs may also affect the level of lending from the Bank's
ordinary capital resources. ,

Additional ADF resources were released to the Bank in
early 1985. However, after taking account of the shortage in
ADF resources at the end of 1984, the concessional funds
now availabie for lending in 1985 are substantially lower than
the planned ADF lending for the year of $800 million.

The present ADF replenishment {ADF IV) covers the fouryear period ending in December 1986. Negotiations with
donor countries on the next replenishment {ADF V} are expected to start in the first half of 1985.

DURING 7984, most developing member countries (DMCs)
either improved their GDP growth rates or maintained growth
rate levels that provided significant increases in per capita
income. Most of them were also able to control domestic inflation and to reduce their trade deficits and debt-service
ratios. These favorable devetopments were largely due to increases in agricultural and manufacturing production, lower
oll prices and the continued recovery of the world economy.
Further, the economic policies pursued by most DMCs
helped to keep their domestic and international debts within
prudent limits.

The fnternational Setting

The world economic recovery which started in 1983
gathered momentum during 1984, World output grew by 4.6
per cent in the latter year compared with an increase of only
2.2 per cent in the former. Both developed and developing
countries shared in this growth. The growth rate of gross
domestic product (GDP) in the industrial countries increased
from 2.6 per cent in 1983 to 4.9 per cent in 1984, while that
of oil-exporting developing countries grew from -0.8 per cent
to 3.8 per cent, and that of. non-oil developing countries
increased from 1.8 per cent to 3.7 per cent.

World trade, which had expanded by 2 per cent in real
terms in 1983, grew by 8.5 per cent during 1984. The current
account deficit of the industrial countries increased sharply from $18.9 billion in 1983 to $62.5 billion, mainty due to
the increased current account deficit of the United States.
The current account deficit of oil-exporting countries declined from $17.5 billion in 1983 to $8 billion in 1984, and due
to some improvement in the terms of trade and continued
export growth, the non-oil developing countries were able to
lower their current account deficit from $52.6 billion to $45
biflion.

The average inflation rate in the industrial countries was
4. per cent in 1984, while the oil-exporting countries had an

average 1984 inflation rate of 10.8 per cent, marginally above
the 10 per cent of 1983. The average inflation rate for the nonoil developing countries increased from 41.4 per cent in 1983
to 44.5 per cent in 1984.

Economic Developments in DMCs

During 1984, many of the Bank’s DMCs sustained or
increased their 1983 growth rates, but some registered a
decline. The average 5.5 per cent GDP growth rate of 16
DMCs! in 1984 was lower than the 6.3 per cent average
increase achieved in 1983 during the recovery from the low
growth rate of 1982, a recession year. However, the 1984
average growth rate was just slightly less than the growth
rate of approximately 8 per cent recorded for the region over
the past decade. .

Economic activity in the DMCs had already begun to pick
up in response to the world economic recovery in 1983. Their
average GDP growth rate of 6.3 per cent in 1983 was much
higher than the average for all non-oil developing countries.
The DMCs’ GDP growth performance in 1984 again substantially exceeded that of other developing countries. This was
attributable to sound policies and improved demand for their
primary commodities and manufactured exports. On balance,
the DMCs also managed their domestic and international
debts well. The Philippines, which experienced a decline in
GDP in 1984, was the only DMC which faced debt-service
problems.

The trade balance of most DMCs improved during the year
mainly because of higher export earnings. With increases
in agricultural output in most DMCs — the second consecutive year of such increases for many of them — the
region's food balance improved significantly. Finally, inflationary pressures were contained in many DMCs during 1984,

for 16 DMCs. However, these countries account for approximately 98 per cent
of the GDP of all DMCs.

GBP Growth

Of the DMCs listed in Table 1,' most experienced
increases in GDP growth rates in 1984. For the second consecutive year, the newly industrializing countries (NICs)?
tegistered high growth rates which, except for the Republic
of Korea, exceeded those of 1983, During 1984, the GDP
growth rates of these countries ranged from 10.6 per cent
in the Republic of China to 7.5 per cent in the Republic of
Korea. High growth rates in the production and export of
manufactured goods contributed to high GDP growth in all
of these countries.

In Southeast Asia, indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand
achieved 1984 GDP growth rates higher than in 1983 as they
were able to take advantage of growing demand and improved prices for their major exports. The 1984 GDP growth
rates for these countries were: Indonesia 4.4 per cent,
Malaysia 6.9 per cent and Thailand 6 per cenit. The
Philippines, however, experienced an economic crisis with
a decline of 4 per cent in GDP.

In the South Asian DMCs, GDP growth rates ranged from
3.9 per cent in Bangladesh to 7.4 per cent in Nepal. While
the 1984 GDP growth rates of Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal and

of india and Pakistan declined in 1984, but remained above
or near their respective average growth rates for the last
decade. These countries generally benefited from increased
exports, although, with the exception of Sri Lanka, the contribution of exports to GDP remained small.

in the South Pacific, Fiji and Papua New Guinea registered
higher GDP growth in 1984 than In 1983. The 8.2 per cent GDP
growth rate in Fiji represented a robust recovery from the 3.8
per cent decline in GDP experienced in 1983, a year of
cyclones and drought. Papua New Guinea's GDP growth increased from 1 per cent in 1983 to 5 per cent due to higher
export growth and the opening of the Ok Tedi mine.

Sectoral Performance

Agricultural production in 1984 increased in most of the
OMCs for which data are available. Generally favorable
weather and firm prices for major export commodities promoted agricultural growth. However, a few DMCs —
Bangladesh, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand —
registered declines in agricultural production due to pest infestations and unfavorable weather.

Total DMC output of major foodgrains' — rice, wheat and
maize — exceeded the previous record level of 1983, combined output rising from 310.8 million tons in 1983 to 314.6
miltion tons in 1984 (see Tables 2 and 3}.

Rice production in the DMCs increased from 228.3 million
tons in 1983 to 229.4 miilion tons In 1984. Significant
increases in rice output were recorded by Burma, India,

Indonesia, Republic of Korea and Viet Nam. These were targely offset by production losses suffered by Bangladesh,
Republic of China, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

Wheat output in DMCs rose from 60.2 miflion tons in 1983
to 61 million tons in 1984, largely due to production gains
registered by India. Pakistan, the other large DMC producer,
experienced a substantiat decline. Maize production in DMCs
increased from 22.3 million tons in 1983 to 24.2 million tons
in 1984. The increased production in most countries was partly offset by a decline in output in Indonesia.

High growth in the staples of foodgrain production in india
and indonesia during 1983 and 1984 raised foodgrain stocks
in those countries to record levels.

The performance of major non-cereal agricultural crops
was mixed in 1984. Output of natural rubber grew by 5.2 per
cent, with Indonesia and Malaysia accounting for most of
the increase. Coconut output deciined by 3.4 per cent. While
most of the DMC producers experienced significant increases, output declined in Philippines and Sri-Lanka, two
major producers in the region. Sugar production declined by
14.8 per. cent, with Bangladesh, india and Philippines
accounting for the deciine. Palm oil production increased by
13.9 per cent since most of the producers among the DMCs
(indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines and
Thailand) increased production. Output of jute declined by
3.9 per cent, due entirely to production losses suffered by
Bangladesh and Burma. Production of tea increased by 5.5
per cent, with India and Sri Lanka accounting for most of the
increase. Output of cotton increased by 17.9 per cent, India
and Pakistan contributing most of the increase.

The, manufacturing sectors of the DMCs generally achieved
high growth in 1984. Strong import demand in developed
countries continued to stimulate substantial growth in
manufactured exports in Republic of China, Hong Kong,
Republic of Korea and Singapore. In Southeast Asia,
indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand enjoyed significant increases in manufacturing output due to both high domestic
demand and growth in exports. The South Asian DMCs which
ate not major exporters of manufactured goods also experienced high growth in manufacturing output, principally

because the availability of raw materials, power and imported
inputs was sustained.

In the Energy sector, electricity production in DMCs increased by 6.3 per cent in 1984, compared with an increase
of 6.1 per cent in 1983. Oil production increased from 114.1
miffion tons in 1983 to 118.3 mililon tons in 1984 (see Table
4). Ali major oil-producing DMCs, except Indonesia, reported
substantial increases in oil production: output of oil in India
increased by 2.8 million tons, in Malaysia by 2,7 million tons
and in Thailand by 6.6 million tons. Indonesia, the largest
DMC producer of oil, reported a 1.9 million ton dectine in output. Most of the nine DMCs producing significant amounts
of natural gas reported expanded production, the largest increases being registered by Bangladesh, Burma, India,
Malaysia and Thailand. A

The total value of oil imports by OMCs declined from $38.5
billion in 1983 to $35.2 billion in 1984, with lower petroleum
prices and a reduction in the volume of imports contributing
to the decline. Large savings in oil import bills were reported
by indonesia ($1,468 million}, Malaysia ($352 million), Pakistan
($176 million), Philippines {$471 million) and Singapore ($855
million). The 1984 ratio of the total value of oi imports to total
export earnings declined from 24.6 per cent in 1983 to 19.5
per cent in 1984. Both a reduction in the aggregate oil bill
and growth in export receipts contributed to this decline.

Price Trends

The 1984 weighted average increase in consumer prices
in DMCs of 8.8 per cent was higher than the 8 per cent in
1983 (see Table 5). Except for the Philippines, which had a
sharp acceleration in its inflation rate from 10.8 per cent In
1983 to 49.3 per cent in 1984, the inflation rates in most countries were relatively moderate. tn the majority of DMCs,
inflation rates declined or remained at single digit levels.
Declines in the prices of foodgrains and oil, as well as
domestic stabilization policies by these DMCs, helped to control inflation. Burma, Republic of China, Fiji, Republic of
Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, Thailand, Tonga and
Vanuatu registered the lowest inflation rates, ranging from
0 to 5 per cent, while inflation rates in Afghanistan,

Bangladesh, Philippines, Solomon itslands, Sri Lanka and
Western Samoa were 10 per cent or more. Large expansion
of monetary demand was an important cause of the high infiation rates experienced by some of these DMCs. Shortages
created by a decline in output, a large currency depreciation
and restricted imports were additional factors behind the very
high inflation experienced by the Philippines.

Extarnai Sector Developments

The combined trade deficit of DMCs fell from $48.4 bittion
in 1983 to $3.3 billion in 1984 (see Table 6). This reflected large
increases in the trade surpluses of Republic of China,
indonesia and Malaysia. Excluding these three countries, the
trade deficit of the remaining DMCs fell from $28.3 blilion
in 1983 to $22.2 billion in 1984. The deficits in several other
countries, including Hong Kong, Republic of Korea, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand, declined although
these deficits: mostly remained high. The largest increases
in trade deficits were registered by Bangladesh, India and
Pakistan,

The trade balance of most countries improved because
their export receipts increased more than their import
payments. The aggregate value of exports from the DMCs
increased by 15.5 per cent, from $156.5 billion in 1983 to
$180.8 billion in 1984. While most of the DMCs shared in this
export expansion, Republic of China, Hong Kong, Republic
ot Korea, Malaysia and Singapore were again the leading exporters in the region, all showing large export gains. Some
of the other DMCs which experienced above-average growth
in their export earnings were Kiribati, Nepal, Sri Lanka,
Thailand, Tonga and Vanuatu. The relatively high levei of nonoil exports ($6 billion) recorded by Indonesia was also
noteworthy.

 

Higher export earnings were attributable to large increases
in manufactured exports and improved export prices for
several primary commodities. The largest price increases
were registered by jute (67.5 per cent), tea (49.4 per cent}, palm
oil (47.8 per cent) and copra (46.1 per cent). Significant price
increases were also recorded by lumber (12.6 per cent) and
lead (4.7 per cent). However, export prices of some of the
other major export commodities (sugar, copper, rubber, rice,
cotton and tin} declined. Sugar prices declined by 36.9 per
cent to their lowest levels‘in 13 years.

The total imports of DMCs increased from $174.6 billion
in 1983 to $184.7 billion in 1984, or by 5.4 per cent. The increases in imports of commodities other than food and oil
were larger, since food and oil imparts by the DMCs dectined, Above-average increases In imports were recorded by
Bangtadesh, Republic of China, Hong Kong, Republic of
Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka,
Tonga, Viet Nam and Western Samoa. A few DMCs (Fiji,
Indonesia, Nepal and Philippines) imported less in 1984 than
in 1883 due to foreign exchange shortages or policies designed to restrict imports.

Export and import unit value indices available for nine
DMCs show that while the terms of trade of six DMCs
improved or remained unchanged during 1984 relative to their
1983 leveis, those of three DMCs registered declines. The
1984 export unit value indices were generally higher than
those of 1983, while the corresponding import unit value
indices mostly registered smaller increases or even some
decline. Terms of trade improved significantly for
Bangladesh, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka and remained unchanged for Hong Kong. Terms of
trade declined for Republic of China, Philippines and
Thailand,

BALANCE OF TRADEany major change from the immediately preceding years.
Japan and the United States remained the region’s two
largest trading partners, absorbing 17.1 per cent and 23.4 per
cent, respectively, of the total exports of the DMCs and
accounting for 24.1 per cent and 18.3 per cent, respectively,
of total imports. The reiative position of the United States
as an export market for DMCs increased significantly in 1983
compared with its position in 1982. Trade among DMCs was
next in importance. In 1983, the share of intra-DMC exports
in total exports was 22 per cent, and the share of intra-DMC
imports in total imports was 20.3 per cent. Trade with oilexporting countries (other than Indonesia) also became prominent in the DMCs’ external trade, reflecting the high cost
of oil imports for DMCs. In 1983, 15.7 per cent of DMCs
imports (largely comprising crude olf} came from oll-exporting
countries while the same group accounted for 6.2 per cent
of the DMCs’ exports during the year.

International reserves of the DMCs increased to a total of
$55.2 billion by the end of 1984, compared with $50 billion
at the end of 1983 (see Table 7}. Republic of China, india,
Indonesia, Singapore and Sri Lanka registered large increases in reserves. However, some other countries —
Bangladesh, Pakistan and Papua New Guinea — experienced
large declines in reserves. At the end of 1984 the level of
teserves for the DMCs as a whole was equivaient to 4.3
months’ imports, compared with 4.1 months’ imports in 1983.
Reserves of individual countries varied between 1.3 months’
imports in the case of Burma and 8.3 months’ imports in the
case of the Republic of China.

Domestic Savings, Investment
and Resource Gap

Data for 1981-1983 relating to domestic savings, investment and the resource gap for 14 DMCs (see Table 8) show
divergent trends. The saving rates among the low savers in
South Aslan countries, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan,
showed significant declines, while, except for Pakistan, their
investment to GDP ratios continued to increase. As a result,
the dependence of these countries on external assistance
continued to increase or remained at a high level. On the
other hand, of the three countries in South Asia with relatively
high rates of saving, India’s saving rate marginally improved but its inve:
Sri Lanka experienced declines in both saving and investment rates. While the dependence of Burma on external
assistance increased, that of India and Sri Lanka declined.

With the exception of Hong Kong, the NICs’ saving rates
either showed significant increases or remained at the 1981
level, while investment rates, with the exception of Singapore,
declined. In all of these countries the dependence on exterhal resources for financing domestic investment registered
a large decline. in the case of the Republic of China the
saving surplus — saving minus investment — showed a
Sharp increase between 1987 and 1983.

in Southeast Asia, there was no consistent trend in saving
and investment rates. While the saving rate increased in
Malaysia between 1981 and 1983, the investment rate was
unchanged; in the Philippines, both the saving and the investment rate declined; in Thailand, the saving rate remained
steady but the investment rate declined. Overall, the
dependence of Malaysia and Thailand on external resources
declined from the 1981 level while that of the Philippines
increased.

the latest year for which data are available (see Table 9). This
decline was due to-a marginal reduction in both concessional
and non-concessional flows which amounted to $7 billion
and $9.4 billion, respectively, in 1983. The largest declines
in net flows occurred in Bangladesh, Republic of China,
Republic of Korea, Pakistan and Singapore. DMCs which experienced the largest increases in net flows during 1983 were
Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines, these being mainly in
the form of larger non-concessional flows.

The total long and medium-term external public debt
outstanding of DMCs increased from $107.5 biltion in 1982
to $120 billion in 1983,7 or by 11.6 per cent (see Table 10},
teflecting the continued net inflow of external resources. Corresponding debt-service payments increased from $12.3
billion in 1982 to $13.9 billion in 1983. There was wide variation in the debt-service ratios of individual DMCs which
ranged from 0.2 per cent for Hong Kong to 33.5 per cent for
Burma. Although these ratios relate to official debt, they adequately represent the overall debt-service burden of the majority of DMCs which rely mainly on official loans or on private
loans guaranteed by the government. in many of these DMCs,
the low debt-service ratio is due to a high grant element in
the total inflow of external resources. Debt-service ratios in
31983 were more than 20 per cent In the cases of Burma,
Pakistan and Western Samoa. The ratios, however,
understate the debt-service burden of some DMCs such as
Hong Kong, Republic of Korea, Philippines and Singapore
where private borrowing without government guarantee is

very large. The Philippines’ overall debt-service situation
became critical in 1983 and the country was forced to declare
a moratorium on debt repayment. However, external debt
restructuring negotiations were virtually completed by the
end of 1984 when a standby credit was approved by the international Monetary Fund (iMF).

Domestic Policies and Efforts

The long-term goa! of economic development as well as
the more immediate concern of short-term stabilization in
response to domestic or external shocks required a variety
of policy interventions by the DMC governments during 1984.
A selective account of such policy initiatives by DMCs in
regard to some major areas is given below. .

Fiscal and Monetary Policies

The buoyant economic activity in DMCs during 1983 and
1984 exerted some pressure on price levels, and in several
DMCs inflation rates showed a tendency to rise. This prompted a number of DMC governments to pursue restrictive
monetary and fiscal policies. The NICs generally maintained
fiscal and monetary policies aimed at preventing the strong
expansionary impact of the external sector from overheating
their economies. The 1984 budgets of Malaysia and Papua
New Guinea continued the tight fiscal policies which prevailed in the previous year. The 1984 budgets of Fiji,
indonesia, Nepal and Pakistan sought to limit the growth of
recurrent expenditure while increasing capital expenditure.

Fiscal and monetary policies in Philippines, Sri Lanka and
Western Samoa — all of which have experienced high intlation rates in recent years — were geared to domestic
stabilization. The Philippines used fiscal and monetary
policies during the second half of the year to curb the serious

inflationary consequences of excess monetary demand and
shortages of output in the economy. Philippines, Sri Lanka
and Western Samoa introduced higher deposit requirements
or an increase in deposit rates to siphon off excess liquidity
from the market.

During the year, several important developments took
place in DMCs which influenced their financial sectors. Real
interest rates were at positive levels in several DMCs due
to their relatively low inflation rates. Malaysia and Singapore
enacted banking jegislation to Improve the supervisory power
of thelr monetary authorities over the lending activities of
financia! Institutlons. Pakistan accelerated the introduction
of islamic principles into the operation of its financial
institutions.

External Trade

in the light of their weak balance-of-payments position,
several DMCs devalued their currencies or aliowed them to
depreciate during the year. DMCs experiencing large
depreciations of their currencies (relative to the US dollar}
were Bhutan (11.8 per cent), india (11.8 per cent), Nepal (8.5
per cent), Philippines (28.9 per cent), Thailand (14.8 per cent)
and Western Samoa (23.7 per cent}. However, the exchange
rate appreciated by 2.8 per cent In the case of the Republic
of China, and Vanuatu revaiued Its currency by 5 per cent,
as the balance-of-payments position of the two countries
strengthened during 1984.

Besides allowing exchange rate movemenis as a general
instrument of balance-of-payments adjustment, DMCs
adopted several other measures aimed at specific objectives.
Bangiadesh, indonesia and Thailand made efforts to diversify thelr exports with some success, Malaysia introduced
a ban on the export of logs in Peninsular Malaysia to take
effect at the beginning of 1985 In order to retard the depletlon of its timber resources. India restricted the export of tea
in order to stabilize the domestic price of the commodity.
The Phillppines restricted the export of copper concentrates
to increase domestic avaiiabliity to users and encouraged
diversion of sugar {and to alternative crops in view of the low
world price of sugar.

Limiting external debt to manageabie levels was a vital
policy issue for DMCs with large external debt liabilities.
Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Thailand took steps to
reduce the growth of their external debt liabilities. Some of
the DMCs actively encouraged the inflow of foreign direct
investment. Indonesla, Republic of Korea and Malaysia
simplified administrative procedures for processing applications by foreign investors and Singapore introduced fiscal
incentives to atiract overseas funds.

import policies pursued by DMCs varied according to the
pressures on the balance of payments of the country concerned. The Philippines undertook several emergency
Measures such as curtailing the importation of non-essential
consumer goods in order to stop the drain on its sharply
reduced foreign exchange resources. Malaysia imposed a
50 per cent duty on imported cement to protect the domestic
cement industry against dumping by foreign suppliers.
Thailand increased import duties on non-essential consumer
goods and imposed a 20 per cent import surcharge on luxury
items. India restricted imports of steel to protect its domestic
steel industry while continuing liberal import of several commodities such as edible oil and fertilizers when domestic
availability was inadequate. in the Republic of China, tariff
rates were reduced in order to stimulate imports, Pakistan
liberalized its import licensing system and considerablyshortened the list of banned items. The Republic of Korea
continued to push ahead with its import liberalization
program.

Energy Programs and Policies

Reducing the burden of energy imports remained a high
priority objective of most DMCs. During the year, major gains
in the production of energy resources were reported by
Bangladesh, Burma, india, Malaysia and Thailand. Large investments in the Energy sector were undertaken during 1984
by Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Lao PDR,
Malaysia, Nepali, Pakistan, Philippines and Thailand.

Although the external price of oil eased somewhat during
the year, some DMCs raised domestic prices of energy products to encourage conservation and to reduce the cost of
subsidies by the government. Considerable increases in
domestic prices of petroleum and petroleum products were
announced by Bangladesh, indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines
and Sri Lanka during 1984.

Regional Cooperation

A number of efforts to promote regional cooperation were
made by DMCs during 1984.

The ASEAN Committee on Trade and Tourism (COTT)
increased the preferences margin on food and non-food items
already covered by preferential trading arrangements and
agreed to increase tariff cuts up to 50 per cent on future
exchanges of tariff preferences. [n addition to products with
import values up to $10 million which are already covered
by tariff preferences, the ASEAN Economic Ministers approved a COTT decision to apply 20-25 per cent across-theboard tariff cuts to items with import values in excess of $10
million, subject to certain exciusions. In 1983, Indonesia's
Urea Project was the first ASEAN Industrial Project to
become operational, while Malaysia's Urea Project is
expected to commence in 1985, Thailand's Soda Ash Project
encountered some technical problems in rock salt mining,
while the Philippines’ copper fabrication project was sti}l in
the planning stage. A hepatitis vaccine project was approved
as Singapore's entry into the ASEAN program of industrial
projects, although no preferential treatment would be given
to it by other ASEAN members. The Economic Ministers also
approved the first four private sector industrial joint ventures
consisting of motorcycle electrical parts, sitica-based
material for glazing ceramic products, mechanical and power
steering parts and constant velocity joints for automobiles.

The Ministers of Agriculture and Forestry signed an agreement relating to cooperation in the management and conservation of fishery resources. The proposal to set up an
ASEAN Timber Technology Center in Kuala Lumpur gained
ground with the European Economic Community's agreement
to provide $6 million of the estimated $11 million operational
cost for the first five years,

The Foreign Ministers of the South Asian Regional
Cooperation (SARC) countries recommended the convening
in 1985 of a Summit of Heads of State or Governments of
the seven member countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka). The Standing Committee, which is the principal policy organ of SARC, reviewed

reports prepared by technical committees on nine agreed
areas of cooperation. The Foreign Ministers gave special
attention to the development of telecommunications and air
transport among member countries and requested that proposals be made concerning the improvement of these links.
Although much of the attention focused on research, training and the exchange of information, longer-term studies on
the feasibility of regional projects and institutions were also
initiated.

At the 15th South Pacific Forum in August, issues relating
to regional trade and proposais for a single regional organization were discussed, The Forum agreed in principle to promote duty-free and unrestricted access to handicrafts traded
between Forum isiand countries.

international Cooperation

At their 10th Annual Summit Meeting held in London, the
heads of the governments of the seven major industrial countries (Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy,
Japan, United Kingdom and United States) reiterated their
call, made at the previous summit, for a new round of trade
liberalization talks and endorsed the OECD Ministerial
Meeting’s support for such a round. In September, high-level
trade officials from the industrial and advanced developing
countries repeated this request at an informal meeting in Rio
de Janeiro, placing special emphasis on the need for reducing farm subsidies and opening markets for farm products in industria! and developed countries. This idea gained
further support in November at the Annual Meeting of the
General Agreement on Tariff and Trade which in the previous
year had given only tukewarm support to a similar proposal
made by Japan and the United States.

Although protectionist pressures continued, further moves
to liberalize trade were-made during the year. The EEC decided to advance by one year to 1 January 1985 its scheduled
Tokyo Round tariff reductions for a list of products considered to be of special interest to developing countries while
Japan had already advanced its application of most-favorednation (MEN) tariff cuts to improve or mitigate the erosion
of Generalized Scheme of Preferences (GSP) margins. Japan
increased quota amounts for industrial products imported
under GSP by 50 per cent during FY 1984.

The United States extended the duration of its GSP for
eight and a half years beyond the scheduted (January 1985)
expiry of its preferences and approved graduation criteria
under which advanced Asian developing countries would also
remain beneficiaries.

The international Agreement on Jute and Jute Products
became provisionally effective. The International Jute
Organization is to use research and development, market promotion and cost reduction as its main instruments as no
price stabilization scheme is provided for. The Sixth tnternational Tin Agreement continued to function provisionally
as negotiations aimed at ratifying a new agreement failed.
The new International Sugar Agreement differs significantly from previous agreements as it has no provision for price
stabilization through stock holding, As a result, the new
Agreement largely serves information and statistical
purposes,

17OPERATIONS AND POLICIES

Lending Operations

LOAN approvais during the year totalled $2,234 million, compared with $1,893 million in 1983. Loans from ordinary capital
resources (OCR) amounted to $1,551 million, an increase of
30 per cent in nominal terms over the corresponding figure
of $1,190 miltion in 1983, Loans from Special Funds (SF),
amounting to $684 million, decreased by 2.7 per cent in
nominal terms from the 1983 figure of $703 million.

Overall Bank lending increased by 18 per cent in nominal
terms in 1984, while over the five-year period 1980-84 the
annual increase averaged 13.1 per centin nominal terms. The
substantial increase in 1984 was due partly to the improved
economic performance of the developing member countries
{DMCs). The liberalization of Bank policies in 1983 on program lending and on the financing of local currency expenditures and interest during construction, a more fiexible implementation of the multiyear programming approach, as well
as the processing of a number of large-sized projects aiso
contributed to the increase in lending during the year.

The Bank approved in 1984, its second year of equity inyestment operations, an equity investment of Rs6 miltion in
ihe National Development Leasing Corporation Ltd. of
Pakistan (see page 21).

During the year, 49 loans were approved for 47 projects

in 18 DMCs, compared with 55 toans for 53 projects in 17
DMCs in 1983. Two of the 1984 projects — one in Pakistan,
Tarbela Hydropower Extension (Units 11 and 12}, and one in
Papua New Guinea, Fourth Road tmprovement (Sector) —
received “blended” loans financed from both OCR and SF.

The average size of ioans increased to $45.6 million in 1984
from $34.4 million in 1983. The average size of OCR loans
rose to $59.6 million in 1984 from $45.8 million in 1983, while
the average size of SF loans increased to $29.7 million from
$24.2 million over the same period. The increase in 1984 was

mainly due to the financing of a large number of medium to
large-sized projects and increased iocal cost financing.
In 1984, about 97 per cent of SF loans went to low-income
DMCs with a per capita gross national product (GNP) in 1983
of less than $400.
During the year, six DMCs received loans exclusively from

_ OCR: Indonesia ($587 million}, Philippines ($275.9 million),

Thalland ($195.2 million), Republic of Korea ($174 million),
Malaysia ($159.9 miflion) and Fiji ($3.2 million).

Two DMCs received loans from both OCR and SF: Pakistan
with $347 million ($137.2 million from OCR and $209.8 million
from SF), and Papua New Guinea with $33.25 million ($18.25
million from OCR and $15 million from SF).

Ten DMCs received loans exclusively from SF: Bangladesh
{$306.8 million}, Nepal ($60.7 nm}, Sri Lanka ($56 million),
Burma ($10 million), Lao PDR ($9 mitlion), Bhutan ($7.4
million), Western Samoa ($4 million), Maldives ($2.38 million),
Solomon Islands ($2 million) and Kiribati ($0.55 million).

Co-financing by official and commercial sources in Bankassisted projects more than trebled to $1,163 million from
$308 million in 1983. White it partly reflected the current world
economic recovery, this record 1984 figure was primarily
attributable to loans for a number of big projects with
unusually large co-financing components.

During the year, about 68 per cent — or over two-thirds
—— of Bank lending was for projects in the two leading sectors of Energy, which absorbed 34.3 per cent of all Bank
tending, compared with 23.8 per cent tn 1983, and Agriculture
and Agro-industry, which accounted for 33.9 per cent, compared with 34.3 per cent a year earlier.

The share of lending for social infrastructure projects
decreased to 10.7 per cent of the total from 22.3 per cent in

 

~ 1983. Lending to development finance institutions (OF Is) also

decreased, to only 2.4 per cent from 10.8 per cent. There was,
however, a significant increase in lending to the Transport
and Communications sector which accounted for 17.1 per
cent of total lending, compared with 3.5 per cent in 1983.

CONTAINERS loading at Kuching Port in Sarawak, Malaysia, where a
$5 million Bank loan helped finance construction of a wharf and other
installations and procure tug beats and cargo handling equipment.20

These changes were due partly to special circumstances and
partly to the cyclical nature of Bank lending in certain
sectors.

The total cost of projects approved during the year — excluding three DF! loans, one program loan, eight sector loans
and one technical assistance program loan — is estimated
at $4 billion. Direct Bank financing accounted for 40.2 per
cent of total project costs. On the basis of the Bank's past
experience, the total cost of subloan projects to be financed
by the three DFI loans is estimated at about $100 miilion.
The projects to be financed by the program toan, technical
assistance program loan and the eight sector loans will involve an estimated total cost of about $1.4 billion.

At the end of 1984, the Bank's cumulative lending had
reached $15.6 billion for 656 projects in 27 DMCs. Of this total,
loans amounting to $10.7 billion were from OCR and $4.9
billion from SF.

in 1984, local cost financing (LCF) amounted to $267.5
million for 23 projects in nine DMCs. Of this, $126.1 million
was from OCR and $141.4 million from SF, representing 8.1
per cent and 20.7 per cent, respectively, of OCR and SF loans
approved during the year. At the end of 1984, the Bank had
provided a total of about $1 billion in LCF.

Co-Financing

During 1984, a total of 23 projects were co-financed, with
co-financiers contributing $1,163 million and the Bank $7,460
million, This was a sharp increase over the previous year,
when 18 projects were co-financed, with co-financiers providing $309 million and the Bank $769 million.

The 1984 figures — the highest both in terms of number
of prolects and co-financiers’ contributions — underline the
fact that in any given year the Bank's co-financing performance depends on a number of factors including the giobat
economic situation, the borrowing programs of DMCs, their
absorptive capacity and the size and nature of projects. The
record performance of 1984 was mainly attributable to the
number of large projects which DMCs initlated during ihe
year.

As of the end of 1984, co-financing had been arranged for
175 Bank-assisted projects, with funds provided by cofinanciers totalling about $4.7 billion and Bank financing
totalling $6 billion.

In 1984, official sources provided funds amounting to $731
million for 49 projects, compared with $128.4 million for 13
projects in 1983, The share of official sources in the tota!
amount of co-financing increased from 42 per cent in 1983
to 63 per cent. Seven of the Bank's member countries —
Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Netherlands,
Norway, Switzerland and United Kingdom — together with
Saudi Arabla provided $348 million and multilateral sources,
comprising the islamic Development Bank (isDB), OPEC Fund
for International Development, United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank Group, contributed
$383 million.

Co-financing with commercial and export credit sources
also increased, totalling $432 million for seven projects and
accounting for 37 per cent of all such lending during the year.
This compared with $180 miillon for five projects in 1983. A
large part of co-financing in 1984 was in the form of export
credits, reflecting the increasing importance attached to this
form of financing, particularly for projects in the Eneray
sector.

Support for Private Sector
Activities in DMCs

The role of the private sector varles among the DMCs, but
in many it contributes substantially to fhe growth of national
income, investment, employment and export earnings as well
as the transfer of technology. Many DMCs have sought in
recent years to stlmulate private enterprise by limiting or
reducing the public sactor’s involvement in the economy and
by creating a conducive policy environment.

The Bank’s strategy in supporting the private sector is
based on credit lines to development finance institutions
{DFls) for onlending to smal! and medium-sized industria!
enterprises; direct equity investments in industrial enterprises and dlrect investments or lines of equity to DFIs for
investment; loans and technical assistance designed to raise
the productivity and incomes of commercial entrepreneurs
in rural areas; loans and technical assistance to help buifd
the skilled labor force and infrastructure services and
facilities which encourage private investment; and technical
assistance to help DMCs develop the institutions and
policies needed to promote private Initiative.

As of the end of 1984, the Bank had lent $1.72 billion
through 76 lines of credit to 29 DFIs In 19 DMCs. Approximately 95 per cent of the enterprises assisted in this way
has been in the private sector and more than three-fourths
of the subloans went to manufacturing enterprises.

In 1984, the Bank extended to DFis two credit lines which
will be onient to small and medium-sized enterprises, most-ly privately held, in Republic of Korea and Western Samoa.
The Bank also supported the development of private
industry through its equity investment of $420,000 in the
National Development Leasing Corporation Ltd. in Pakistan,
a new company sponsored by a Bank-assisted DFi and
several other private investors. It is expected to play a
pioneering role in extending equipment lease financing to
the private sector. As of 31 December 1984, the Bank had
approved three equity investments totalling $3.38 million.
Some agricultural projects financed by the Bank in 1984
will create additional commercial opportunities in private
agriculture-related industries. For example, the Hill
Agriculture Development Project in Nepal will, among other
things, provide credit through the Agricultural Development
Bank of Nepal for horticulture development involving privately
owned nurseries, storage and processing facilities.
Shortages of skilled manpower can be a major disincentive to private investment. Recognizing this constraint, the
Bank in 4984 provided assistance to expand facilities,
upgrade curricula, and improve teaching standards in scientific and technical schools in Bangladesh and Indonesia.
in 4984, the Bank provided a technical assistance grant
to the Philippines to help examine methods of accelerating
development of indigenous coal resources through increased
participation of the private coal mining industry. Other Bank
technical assistance will support analysis of the role of the
public sector in energy business and the possible “privatization” of the Government-owned Philippine National Oli Company, and the rationalization of domestic oil refining,
including links between the Government and privately owned
refineries.
The Sank is now undertaking a comprehensive review of
its overall strategy of assistance to the private sector.

Benefits to the Poor

In pursuit of its goal of atleviating poverty in its DMCs, the
Bank in 1984 achieved a level of concessional lending to the
poorer countries only slightly below its 1983 record level. It
also continued to give priority to projects designed to raise
incomes and create jobs in rural areas. Moreover, the Bank
placed greater emphasis on expanding and improving
physical infrastructure in less-developed areas of the DMCs.

Lending from ADF resources reached $684 million, 2.7 per
cent lower than in 1983. Aside from Burma and, to 2 lesser
degree, Nepal, however, concessional lending to the other
ADF recipient countries increased by 13 per cent.

Making land more productive through irrigation and providing poor and landiess farmers with the inputs, training and
credit to increase agricultural output have been fundamental to Bank efforts to reduce poverty.

in 1984, the Bank approved loans for three major irrigation
projects, provided supplementary loans to complete two
ongoing Bank irrigation projects and included irrigation components in several other agricultural projects, These projects
will help raise agricultural production and farm incomes. in
Pakistan, for example, the Left Bank Outfall Drain (Stage |)
Project is expected to be of direct benefit to nearly 100,000
poor farm families, while a project in Indonesia has the potential of almost doubling the average income of over 10,000
poor farm families. Furthermore, the Indonesian project will
generate about 10,500 man-years of employment during construction and will provide 17,000 man-years of additional
employment annually after completion.

The smal} farmer and the rural landless will be the principal beneficiaries of six Bank-financed agricultural development projects approved in 1984, one each in Fiji, Malaysia
and Nepal and three in Indonesia. These loans will finance
a wide range of agricultural investments aimed at raising the
productivity and incomes of small farmers through measures
which include intensifying and diversifying crops, introducing
higher-yield varieties, widening the use of fertilizer, making
more agricultural credit available and strengthening infrastructure. In Malaysia, 7,000 smallholder families will increase their incomes through Bank-financed replanting of
unproductive rubber trees with oil palm and high-yielding
Tubber trees.

The Bank also extended physical infrastructure in poorer
regions of DMCs in 1984. Loans were approved to upgrade
roads in rural areas of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. The
poor will be among those to benefit from improved farm-tomarket transportation, easier access to health and education facilities and enhanced mobility that could open new
employment opportunities. Other jobs will be created in the
construction of these roads.

Of even more direct benefit to the poor are loans approved
by the Bank for two water supply projects, one each in Nepat
and Bhutan. These projects will improve heath, reduce infant
mortality and lower morbidity rates by lessening the incidence of water-borne and water-based parasitic diseases.

 

21Women in Bank-Assisted Activities

The Bank’s lending program in 1984 included a number of
projects which will assist women in the vital role they play
in the economic and sociai development of DMCs. These
projecis wili create employment and income-raising opportunities, help women in maintaining family heafth and welfare
and reduce the burden of household chores, leaving time for
other productive activities.

Many Bank-financed projects in the Agriculture sector wili
provide assistance equaily to women and men as agricultural
producers. Increasing household income frequently depends
upon a division of family labor which casts women In key
productive roles. The Second Kalimantan Livestock Development Project in indonesia, for exampte, is designed to
increase the quantity and improve the quality of livestock

-held by small farmers. As llvastock on family farms in the
project area are frequently tended by females, the added income expected to derive from this Project will be largely
achieved by women, enhancing their position as family
tncome-earners. in addition, the Fisheries Infrastructure
(Sector) Project in Indonesia will generate employment opportunities for women beyond their family farms by creating
some 50,000 on-shore jobs tn activities such as fish processing and canning, positions usually filled by women.

The Bank-assisted Second Health and Population Project
in Pakistan will finance a major expansion of and improvement in health services in sefected areas of the country.
Whlie both male and femate members of the communities
are expected to benefit, this Project Is particularly relevant
to women, through Its provision of maternity care as wall as
facilities and counselling on health care. Similar support will

 

be offered by rural health facitities built into several irrigation projects financed by the Bank in 1984.

Women will also be prime beneficiaries of the four Bankfinanced water supply projects approved in 1984. Designed
to reduce water-borne or water-based diseases by piping safe
drinking water, the projects will, In turn, ease the burden of
women in caring for sick family members.

Many rural women spend much of their time and energy
obtaining water for their households, often over ong
distances. The Bank-financed Rural Water Supply Sector Project in Nepal wit] make water more accessible to farm households, enabling women to spend their time more productively.

Training Activities

Efficient manpower and responsive institutions are crucial
ingredients in the development of every economic sector in
the Bank’s DMGs. in an effort to strengthen human resources
and institutional capacities, the Bank has increased its {ending and technical assistance for education and training
programs.

These tralning activities consist of four main types:
project-related training under Bank ioans; institution-building
training under advisory and operational technical assistance
grants; general training under regional technical assistance
grants; and on the Job training for DMC officiais seconded
to the Bank.

in 1984, a number of Bank loans incorporated various forms
of training. Under the Third Senior Technical Schools Project tn Indonesia, for exampie, staff members of institutlons
assisted by the Project will recelve 1,626 man-months of
overseas training fellowships, in addition to a program of
seminars, workshops and in-service training within the
country.

The Second Health and Population Project in Pakistan wiil
provide 235 man-months of overseas fellowships in such
flelds as nursing and kealth-service management, as well as
in-service and pre-service training in family planning. in Lao
PDR, staff involved in implementing the Vientiane Plain Road
improvement Project received training in procurement at the
Bank's Headquarters.

During the year, technical assistance was extended for
institution building in several DMCs, In Kiribati, for instance,
personnel will be trained in operating and managing the Betio
Shipyard, the country’s only such facility, and will be provided with overseas fellowships. The shipyard is to be rehabilitated under a joan also approved by the Bank in 1984,

On a regional basis, the Bank provided technical
assistance for two training programs conducted by the Asian
Productivity Organization for staff from government agencies, national productivity organizations and development
institutions in a number of DMCs. One course, on rural project development, was held in Bangaiore and New Delhi, india.
The other, on project feasibility, appraisat and Implementation, was heid in Maniia and Tokyo.

The Bank also conducted four regtonal training programs
in 1984 specifically designed to upgrade the knowledge and
skills of DFI personnel. Two such programs — one for South
Pacific and the other for Asian DFls — dealt with Management Development and were held, respectively, in Port Vila,
Vanuatu and Bangkok, Thailand. One Program on Project
Implementation and Supervision was held in Karachi,
Pakistan, in cooperation with local DFis and a Program on
Market Appraisal of Industrial Projects was conducted inManila, Philippines. A total of 98 staff from 29 DFIs in 20
DMCs benefited from these activities.

In an effort to upgrade the accounting and management
information systems in Bank-assisted power utilities, the
Bank organized a Regional Program on Power Utility Accounting and Management Information System in Baguio City,
Phillppines. The Program was attended by 23 professionals
from 18 power utilities in the region.

To help upgrade the capabilities of staff of executing agencies to implement projects, three regional loan administration seminars were held in Manila, two on procurement and
one on project implementation management. These seminars
were attended by 62 senior and middle-level officials from
13 borrowing member countries. in addition to the regional
seminars, five country seminars on procurement and a country seminar for domestic consultants were held in
Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines and
Thailand.

In 1984, the Bank provided on the job training under its
secondment program to five officials from DMCs for periods
ranging from six months to one year. Under its attachment
program, four other officials received short-term famitiarization with the Bank’s activities.

THE management of natural resources is a top priority of the Bankfinanced Songkhia Lake Basin Planning Study which involves the
formulation of an integrated development program in southern
Thailand.

 

Environmental Activities

Through its environment specialists, the Bank is attempting to promote the integration of environmental considerations into its economic development activities, It does this
by systematically reviewing projects at all stages in order
to identify potentiaily adverse environmental impacts as well
as to formulate measures to prevent or mitigate them. The
environment specialists also assist in providing environmen:
tal education and training for Bank staff and officials of
DMCs.

During 1984, the environment specialists began drafting
comprehensive environmental and natural resource profiles
for selected DMCs. These are intended to help identify environmental and natural resource opportunities and constraints likely to affect development. They are also expected
to indicate the kinds of projects which can help correct
critical loss or degradation of these resources.

Also during the year, the specialists began strengthening
the integration of environmental measures in the planning
and design of Bank-financed projects.

A review of the Bank's environmental policies and procedures was initiated with the intention of recommending
clearer policy guidelines and more appropriate operational
procedures. As part of this process, a Regional Seminar on
“Environmental and Natural Resource Planning and Management” has been prepared to examine the environmental practices in the Bank's region and specify requirements for
achieving environmentally sound economic development.
Work on “Economic Valuation of Environmental Considerations in the Project Cycle” began in 1984 and is expected
to be completed in 1985.

Sectoral Review

Agriculture and Agro-Industry

The Bank continues to give high priority to improving food
and commercial crop production, expanding employment and
raising living standards in rural areas where most people in
DMCs live and work. Reflecting this, lending to the
Agriculture and Agro-Indusiry sector (which covers irrigation
and rural development, fisheries, livestock, agricultural credit
and support services, foresiry, fertilizer and agro-processing)
teached a record $758 million in 1984, an increase of 16.9
per cent over $648.4 million in 1983.

The projects supported by the Bank in 1984 ranged/i in size
from large-scale irrigation works in Pakistan to a relatively
smali multisectoral agricultural development project in Fiji.
The range of subsectoral activities was equally broad, including support for fisheries infrastructure, livestock production, forestry development, smatihoider and plantation farming, crop protection and essential productive inputs, and improvements in irrigation works and other facilities. In all projects, training and consulting services were provided to
strengthen implementation and institutional capacities in
DMCs.

A special feature of the Bank’s operations in 1984 in the
Agriculture and Agro-Industry sector was its prompt response
— through a $130 million Agricultural Inputs Program loan
— to the serious economic difficulties encountered by the
Philippines. The loan sought to maintain the country’s production of rice, corn and other food crops at normal levels
despite a severe shortage of imported fertilizers, pesticides

The number of technical assistance projects in this sector changed little from the previous year, but declined slightly
in tinancial terms. During 1984, nearly 46 per cent of the
Bank’s technical assistance was approved for agriculture and
agro-industrial activities. Technical assistance to this sector funded from the Bank and other sources at the end of
41984 amounted to $8.4 million for 37 projects, compared with
$9.9 miition for 34 projects in 1983.

Nearly two-thirds of the technical assistance approved in
this sector in 1984 was for the preparation of future projects,
the rest for advisory and operational purposes. Regional
studies on the handling of fisheries products for marketing
and on food supply and demand in the Sank’s DMCs were
also supported during the year.

Regional workshops and seminars on carp hatchery and
nursery technology, livestock production management and
rural development were conducted in 1984,

amounted to $4.8 billion for 228 projects, while technical
assistance amounted to $77.2 miflion for 31% projects. In
terms of overail Bank iending, the Agriculture and Agroindustry sector received about one-third (33.9 per cent) of total
loans during 1984, compared with 34.3 per cent in 1983.

irrigation and Rural Development: Bank lending in this
subsector in 1984 was designed to help increase food production, generate agricultural employment, alleviate pover- °
ty and conserve foreign exchange.

By far the largest project undertaken in 1984 in pursuit of
these aims was the Left Bank Outfall Drain (Stage I} Project
in Pakistan, where extensive irrigation without drainage for
excess water and saits in Sind Province has raised the water
table and left the soil waterlogged and salinized. The Bank
approved 4 $122 miilion concessional loan for this major corrective project, which was also supported by Go-financing
from six other sources.

During the year, the Bank provided additional funding
either to complete, remedy or to extend the benefits of fourprojects previously supported with Bank loans. In this
respect, supplementary loans were approved for the Chitwan
Valley Development Project in Nepal and the Allah River
irrigation Project in the Philippines. A new loan was extended for the Walawe Irrigation Improvement Project in Sri Lanka
to rehabilitate and enhance the existing Walawe Development Project. The Chashma Command Area Development
Project in Pakistan will complement the ongoing Chashma
Right Bank Irrigation Project and On-Farm Water Management Project.

During the year, the Bank approved loans for three other
projects — in Fiji, Malaysia and Nepal — designed to help
reduce rural poverty by maximizing the productivity of
agricultural land and increasing farm incomes.

The Bank approved nine loans totalling $320.5 million for
this subsector, accounting for 42.3 per cent of the Bank's
total lending for Agriculture and Agro-industry during the year
and raising cumulative lending to the subsector to $2.4
billion.

Fisheries: The Bank has adopted an integrated approach
to fisheries development, encompassing a chain of operations from the catching or-culture of fish to preserving and
then marketing these in domestic and/or export markets. It
has also emphasized appropriate, low-cost technology
wherever feasible. In 1984, the Bank focused on marine
fisheries, giving special attention to the provision of shorebased support facilities, particularly. harbors and landing
sites. A $50 million toan for the Fisheries Infrastructure Sector Project In indonesia will increase fish production, improve
the quality of marine fish landings and reduce operational
costs, :

Technical assistance was provided for the preparation of
aquaculture and fisheries development projects in
Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kiribati, Mataysia and Nepal and the
improvement of marketing of fish and fish products.

As of the end of 1984, the Bank had approved 35 loans
totalling $549 million for marine and inland fisheries.

Livestock: The Bank's assistance to this subsector has
in the past focused principally on smati farmer livestock
development. During 1984, this type of assistance continued
to expand through the approval of a $60 million loan to
Indonesia for the Second Kalimantan Livestock Development
Project.

As of the end of 1984, the Bank had approved 13 loans
totalting $195 million for livestock projects.

Forestry: The interdependence of agriculture and forestry
has led to an increase in recent years of Bank support for
forest development projects which supply raw materials for
wood-based industries while, at the same time, improving
the environment and quality of life in rural areas. !n particular,
the Bank has paid special attention to reforestation in order
to replenish the diminishing supply of wood.

The Bank approved loans for two forestry projects in 1984:
$24.5 million for the Compensatory Forestry Sector Project
in Malaysia and $8 million for the second phase of an ongoing Forestry Development Project in Lao PDR.

As of the end of 1984, the Bank had provided 11 loans totalling $168.9 million to the forestry subsector.

Industrial Crops and Agro-Industries: Industrial crops
play a significant role in import substitution and foreign exchange earnings and savings, and there have been substan
 

tial increases in the acreage under selected industrial crops
in some DMCs. Taking a practical approach in this subsector, the Bank seeks to ensure that projects are competitive,
marketing facilities are adequate and that private sector participation is enhanced wherever possible. The Bank supported two plantation projects in 1984 through approvai of
a $87 million loan for devetoping oil palm in nucleus estates
and smallholdings in Indonesia and a $45 million loan for
developing the plantation sector in Sri Lanka.

As of the end of 1984, the Bank had provided a total of
$441.6 million in loans for 29 projects in this subsector.

Agricultural Support Services: Reliable supplies of essential farm inputs and services are essential for raising
agricultural production. Recognizing this, the Bank in 1984
approved a $63 million loan designed to reduce losses in
plantation crops in Indonesia by developing a comprehensive crop protection service integrating pest, disease and
weed control methods.

As of the end of 1984, the Bank had provided 34 loans totalling $767.2 million for various agricultural support services
and program loans, including $284.5 million for agricultural
credit projects.

Energy

During 1984, the Energy sector surpassed the Agriculture
sector to become the largest in terms of total lending, with
its share rising to 34 per cent fromm 24 per cent in 1983, The
Bank approved 1% loans in this sector amounting to $767
millton, compared with nine loans amounting to $451 million
in 1983.

The main thrust of Bank lending and technical assistance
operations reflects a strategy of assisting DMGs to carry out
adjustments necessitated by major changes in the world
energy situation since 1973, in recent years, Bank operations
in this sector have become more comprehensive, and now
increasingly include assistance to develop indigenous energy
resources, Improve existing facillties, strengthen infrastructure, promote energy conservation and enhance the
capabilities of national energy institutions to formulate and
implement effectively energy plans and policies.

In line with the shift in Bank lending toward developing
indigenous energy resources, lending for hydropower, coal
and natural gas projects increased to $398 miftion in 1984

Lending for power projects, including hydropower, rose to
$538 million from $429 million in 1983, although its share of
total lending to the sector decreased from 95 per cent in 1983
fo 70 per cent. Use of renewable and indigenous energy
tesources received priority in four Bank-financed power projecis, of which three will help develop hydropower in Lao PDR,
Malaysia and Pakistan, and one will help generate thermal
power with indigenous lignite in Thailand. A project in
Bangladesh Is expected to expand natural gas production
to reduce dependence on imported oil, while assistance provided to the Philippines will Increase Indigenous coal production and help reduce coal imports.

improving the operational efficiency of power supply
systems continued to be a major Bank activity in 1984 with
loans for this purpose approved for projects in Bangladesh,
Nepal and Philippines. In addition, natural gas will be made
available to more households as well as to commercial,
power and industrial establishments under the Seoul-Incheon
Natural Gas Distribution Project in the Republic of Korea.

Multisector1984 aiso reflected the Bank’s emphasis on diversifying
energy activities. The Bank agreed to finance studies for
power projects in Papua New Guinea and Western Samoa,
an oil refinery in the Philippines and a gas distribution project in the Republic of Korea,

Advisory technical assistance was approved for formulating energy pricing policies. Three grants will help the
Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand to strengthen their institutional and planning capabilities in this field. Two other
pricing studies will help the Philippines and the Republic of
Korea prepare rational pricing policies for their power and
gas sectors, respectively. In addition, the development of
domestic resources and facilities through participation of
the private sector will be examined under a coal study and
a refinery sector rationalization study in the Philippines.

The Bank undertook Energy sector reviews for Pakistan,
Philippines and Republic of Korea and participated in the
UNDP/World Bank energy assessment of Burma. Studies on
regiona} energy issues — such as devetoping energy from
plant residues (bagasse), the market potentiais of liquified
natural gas (LNG) and rural electrification — also were
oriented toward using indigenous resources and conserving
energy. A regional energy demand management study was
undertaken during the year. The Bank’s advisory role in this
sector was strengthened by informational and supporting
activities such as developing an energy data base.

Technical assistance grants totalled $2.3 million in 1984,
compared with $3.6 million in 1983. As of the end of 1984,
the Bank had provided a total of 144 loans amounting to $4.1
billion in the Energy sector. This accounted for about 26 per
cent of total Bank Jending.

Industry and Non-Fuel Minerals

Industrialization is a major Instrument of economic growth
for many of the Bank’s DMCs. In recent years, the Industry
sector has been the most rapidly growing sector in a number
of these countries, and its contribution to GNP has increased
considerably. The Bank's DMCs vary greatly not only in size
and their natural resource bases, but also in their degree of
industrialization and poticies for industrial development. Consequently, the Bank adopts-a country-specific approach,
based on detailed sectoral analysis, in determining projects
or programs to be assisted. .

The Bank has supported industrial development programs
and projects that earn or save foreign exchange, make efficient use of local resources, create significant numbers of
jobs, promote development in less-developed areas and
cultivate local entrepreneurial, managerial and technicat
skills. Direct lending to industry has mainly supported
relatively large projects such as cement, petrochemical and
fertitizer plants. Smasl and medium-sized industries receive
financial assistance from the Bank through development
banks. In general, Bank assistance is designed to promote
and develop viable industries which produce essential
developmental goods, exports or import substitutes and
machinery or components to expand the industrial base. In
addition, the Bank has supported the development of industrial infrastructure and industrial research and management training institutes which help small and medium-scale
industries to improve technology and technical standards
as well as increase productivity.

Most DMGs are known to have substantial unexplored nonfuel mineral resources. The discovery and exploitation of
these resources can accelerate national development and

earn or save scarce foreign exchange. The Bank helps DMCs
to develop their mineral resources through technical
assistance and loans for strengthening their institutional
capabilities to undertake geological, geochemical,
geophysical and geothermal surveys.

In 1984, the Bank approved a $220,000 technical assistance
grant for the review and evaluation of the operations of a urea
fertilizer plant in Sri Lanka and a $350,000 technical
assistance grant for the study of private sector coal development in the Philippines. Two other small-scale project
preparatory technical assistance projects were approved —
$75,000 for a Graphite Market Study in Sri Lanka and $74,500
for the Chhatak Cement Plant Rehabilitation Project in
Bangladesh.

As of the end of 1984, the Bank had made 27 loans amount:
ing to $486.4 million in the industry and Non-Fuei Minerals
sector, Cumuiative technical assistance amounted to $4.3
mililion for 27 projects, including four regional studies.

Development Banks

During the year, the Bank continued to support investment
in development projects undertaken by smal! and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs have significant potential for
creating jobs and developing entrepreneurs, but they generally lack access to the external funds needed for capital expenditures. Moreover, their requirements are generally too
smail to merit the Bank's direct financing.

The Bank has, therefore, followed a policy of supporting
suitable SMEs through credit fines to development finance
institutions (DFls}. These have proven to be effective and
appropriate financial intermediaries operating in the DMCs
for this purpose. In the process, the Sank has also helped
enlarge the resource bases of the recipient DFis, thereby contributing to the expansion and diversification of their
portfolios.

Such credit lines serve as the primary channel of Bank
assistance to private enterprise and its main method of supporting the industrial sector. Credit lines have also helped
the rapid transfer of resources to DMCs for productive
purposes.

The Bank encourages the emergence of financially sound,
well-managed DFis that can efficiently mobilize and deploy
domestic and external resources. It has hetped to set up new
DFls in some DMCs and to sustain and strengthen existing
DFIs in others. These institution-building efforts have been
aided by appropriate covenants attached to the Bank’s credit
lines, by dialogues with the recipient DFis, by technical
assistance grants and by staff training programs, both regionwide and for individual DF Is. in addition, the Bank has been
extending equity support to DFls and other financial institutions since 1883.

The Sank approved three credit lines totalling $54 million
during the year: $40 million as a third credit line to the
Citizens National Bank which specializes in financing smailscale industries in the Republic of Korea; $10 million as a
second credit line to Myanrma Economic Bank (MEB), the sole
institutional source of industrial financing in Burma; and $4
million as a fifth credit line to the Development Bank of
Western Samoa (DBWS). Five technical assistance grants
totalling over $1 million were also approved during the year,

As of the end of 1984, the Bank had approved and administered 35 technical assistance grants totalling $6.3
million in this sector.

mainly in the industrial sector, had reached $1.7 billion by
the end of 1984. This represented 11 per cent of all loans approved by the Bank.

Transport and Communications

Both the Bank and its DMCs recognize that the development of adequate and effective transportation and communication infrastructure is a vital factor in socio-economic
growth. The Bank's strategy in the Transport subsector is
to support the development of appropriate and economical
systems that will transport people and goods rapidly and efficiently; in the Communications subsector, the Bank is helping construct facilities that will allow the easy, cheap
transmission of information — a basic requirement in
economic development.

In 1984, Bank iending for Transport and Communications
projects rose sharply to $381.2 million from the relatively low
figure of $65 million in 1983. The share of the sector in total
Bank lending also rose significantly, to over 17 per cent from
just 3.4 per cent in 1983,

Loans approved during the year will support a wide vartety
of projects, including the construction, improvement or

modernization of ports (in Indonesia and Malaysia), ship
repair facilities (in Kiribati}, railways (in Bangladesh} and
roads {in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Solomon
Istands). A Bank joan of $95 million for the Seventh Road
(Sector) Project in Indonesia is the largest to date approved
in this sector. The Bank also approved a loan for its first
telecommunications project in Thailand.

Another noteworthy feature of the year’s lending was the
contribution made toward meeting DMC manpower training
needs in this sector through the incorporation into a number
of projects of components for training the management and
staff of government agencies.

Technical assistance grants for project preparatory as well
as advisory and operational purposes also rose in 1984,
amounting to $3.3 million for 12 projects, compared with $1
million for five projects In 1983.

As of the end of 1984, Bank lending to this sector totalled
Just over $2 billion in 99 ioans, or 13.2 per cent of total lending. Technical assistance grants amounted to $15.1 million
for 78 projects, or 10.4 per cent of the total.

Water Supply and Sanitation

Safe water supplies and sanitary disposal of human wasie
are basic minimum human needs. The World Health
Organization estimates that approximately 80 per cent of all
sickness and diseases can be attributed to Inadequate water
supplies or sanitatlon facilitles.

in earlier years, Bank lending in this sector — and most
requests for assistance from DMCs — focused on large
urban water supply and sewerage systems. Loans for water
supply projects in such major cities as Bangkok, Hong Kong,
Manlla, Rangoon, Seoul, Singapore and Vientlane were made
between 1970 and 1974. Loans covering major urban centers
such as Bandung, Busan, Daegu, Falsaiabad, Hyderabad and
Penang were made between 1968 and 1877. Most of these
projects augmented and Improved existing water supply
systems,

The Bank's emphasis has since shifted to more balanced
development, both in urban and rural areas, to promote social
equity and improve health conditions. Jn recent years, the
Bank has financed a number of projects designed to provide
water supply facilities in provincial towns and rural areas.
its foans have helped increase water supply and sewerage
capacity in 15 GMCs, benefiting more than 57 million peopie in metropolitan areas, smalier cities and towns, provincial districts and ruraf areas.

During 1984, the Bank approved loans for three projects
— two in the Repubtic of Korea and one in Nepal — totalling $103.6 million in this sector, In addition, a $7.4 miliion
loan was approved for the Second Multiproject in Bhutan,
a@ major component of which is a water supply project.

During 1984, the Bank also approved six technical
assistance grants amounting to $950,000 in this sector, compared with four grants amounting to $865,000 in 1983.

As of the end of 1984, total Bank lending to the Water Supply and Sanitation sector amounted to $1.2 dillion covering
51 projects in 15 countries, while technical assistance
amounted to $8 million for 42 projects.

Urban Development

\n the Urban Development sector, the Bank’s approach is
to support programs that improve the living conditions of lowincome households and promote more efficient and orderlyurban growth. In the past, the Bank has helped upgrade infrastructure and provide low-cost housing in urban centers
as well as secondary cities, including small towns, regional
development areas and new towns. These projects have
emphasized provision of essential services for low-income
groups and integration of urban facilities with other essential services. Projects frequently include improvements to
infrastructure and services in sium areas, sites-and-services
schemes, integrated urban/regional development, creation
of new towns and provision of various kinds of low-cost
housing. The Bank gives priority to institutional development,
notably the strengthening of executing agencies’ policymaking skills and technical and institutional competence;
the Bank also heips executing agencies upgrade their
abilities in managing finances, municipal operations and
land-use planning.

During 1984, a technical assistance grant was approved
for an Urban Sector Profile Study in Pakistan. Among other
things, this will review urbanization trends, identify strategic
and policy issues in urban development and assess the

development potential of selected intermediate cities and
towns. The need for such a review was perceived with the
completion of the Basic Strategy Study, undertaken earlier
in the year, which identified the rapid unplanned urbanization and resulting deterioration in urban infrastructure and
living conditions of the urban poor as a major development
problem. The Study also recommended that the Bank support government efforts to manage more effectively
Pakistan’s rapid urban growth and to improve environmental conditions in major cities.

Similar studies have also been conducted in indonesia (in
4983) and in Malaysia (during 1984) under Bank technical
assistance grants. The experience gained from these studies
is expected to help develop appropriate sector operational
policies as well as identify projects suitable for future Bank
support.

At the end of 1984, total Bank lending for urban development and housing had reached $306.2 million for 11 projects.
Technical assistance extended by the Bank in this sector
amounted to $2 mifion.

Education

in the Education sector, the Bank continues to emphasize
projects designed to provide the trained manpower necessary
to support economic and industria! development. The Bank
has financed education projects ranging from secondary to
university levels, with top priority given to vocational education including technical, agricultural, science, commercial
and management education in the formal sector and
community-orlented vocational training in the non-formal sector. Bank-financed projects normally include such components as buildings and equipment, reference materials and
textbooks, audio-visual aids, curriculum and staff development and institution building for management of education
systems, often with assistance from academic and other consultants. The broad objectives include not only providing both
students and teachers with better and more relevant
knowledge and skilts, but also introducing concepts that wiil
improve the education system, lead to social and cultural
development and help upgrade the national quality of fife.

During 1984, the Bank approved foans of $37 million for
the Secondary Science Education Sector Project. in
Bangladesh and $83 million for the Third Senior Technical
Schools Project in Indonesia. The Bank also provided $2.3
mitlion to Bhutan for establishing a Royal Institute of
Management as part of the Second Muitiproject loan.

In 1984, three technical assistance grants, amounting to
$395,000, were approved for projects in Indonesia, Pakistan
and Papua New Guinea. The Bank also undertook education
sectoral studies in Bangladesh and indonesia to heip develop
appropriate sector policies and identify priority projects
suitable for future Bank financing.

Total Bank assistance to the Education sector at the end
of 1984 amounted to $606,4 milllon for 26 projects and $4.8
million for 28 technical assistance projects.

Health and Population

Most of the Bank's DMCs are actively pursuing policies
designed to reduce poputation growth and improve nationat
health, two goals with far-reaching implications for their
social and economic development. The total 1284 population
of DMCs was estimated at 1.4 bilfion, or about one-third of
the world’s population. In several DMCs, annual rates of
population growth exceed 2 per cent, which will double the
population in those countries in less than 35 years. In many
less-developed areas, meanwhile, poor nutrition has lowered
resistance to disease, resulting in a high incidence of morbidity and ill health, particularly among children.

The Bank has been active in assisting programs aimed at
improving health and reducing fertility. In the early and
mid-1870s, such support was incorporated into certain
integrated area development projects, and since 1978 the
Bank has been supporting health and population projects
directly.

During 1984, a $16 million concessional loan was approved
for the Second Health and Population Project in Pakistan,
undertaking wide-ranging improvements in the delivery of
health and population welfare services, The Bank also approved three technical assistance grants during the year for
projects in Malaysia, Pakistan and Papua New Guinea,

As of the end of 1984, the Bank had approved $222.8 million
for 11 loans to the Health and Population sector and $2.7
million in technical assistance.

the Bank's Special Funds resources.

Multisector

Muitisecior loans include a Technical Assistance Program
Loan for a Multisector Program in Indonesia, for which the
Bank approved $25 million in 1984, as well as multiproject
loans to small DMCs. During 1984, two multiproject loans
— in Bhutan and Maldives — totalling $9.78 million were
approved, compared with two such loans totalling $7.2 million
during 1983. The Bank nas approved eight multisector loans
to date, totalling $45.86 million.

Loan Administration

In 1984, the Bank continued to pursue its country-specific
approach in Improving the implementation of Bank-financed
Projects. Country project implementation review missions
visited Indonesia thrice, Pakistan twice and Bangladesh once
at the requests of their Governments to review the progress
of projects in each country and to discuss policy matters as
well as governmental rules and regulations on project implementation, In most cases agreements were reached toapply appropriate solutions and to accelerate project implementation and disbursement of loans.

A technical assistance grant was approved to help Lao
PDR set up a Project Implementation Advisory Unit to train
local staff in carrying out project activities such as consultant recruitment, procurement, disbursement and accounting
of funds. The first draft of a comparative study on civil works
construction in three countries, prepared under a technical
assistance grant, is now being reviewed by Bank staff. The
study, which includes a general assessment of the construction industry in these countries, focuses on such aspects
as quality of civil works, financial management, procurement
and contract management and the planning process. it is expected to result in measures to help improve the contracting capability of local construction companies and the quality
of construction works in Bank-financed projects.

Several important measures were adopted to improve the
procurement of goods and services. Sample bidding
documents for goods have been prepared and are being made
available to executing agencies. Other sets of documents
for civil works and supply and installation contracts are being
prepared. The preparation of a handbook on common
mistakes in procurement has been approved, while another
handbook on the engagement and use of consultants is now

under preparation. Work on a handbook on project implemen- °

tation management is also in progress. These documents,
when completed, will greatly facilitate the preparation of draft
bidding documents and review of such documents by the
Bank, minimize mistakes in bid evaluation, expedite
recruiting consultants and generally upgrade the level of
knowledge and skills of project staff in implementing pro}
ects. To help promote wider and more effective international —

competition, ihe Bank has launched a program of seminars
to familiarize potential suppliers and contractors in member
countries with the business opportunities available under
Bank-financed procurement and to provide guidance on how
to prepare responsive bids.

The Bank continued to introduce improvements in its internal loan administration system. For purposes of individual
project monitoring, Critical Path Method-Project Evaluation
and Review Technique (CPM-PERT) networks have been
prepared for more projects and the technique itself is now
being computerized. Computerization of project data in the
Loan and Financial Information System (LFIS) was further
expanded, while the two first phases of the Loan and
Technical Assistance Administration System (LTAAS) were
programmed and tested. The data on consultants (DAGON
and DICON forms} are now fully computerized, providing
easier access to information on consultants. A review of the
Bank's Loan Administration Instructions {LAIs) was begun
and new LAIs which will provide more comprehensive and
detailed guidance to Bank staff will soon be issued. {mprovements were also introduced in the Bank’s procedures
for review.of slow-moving loans, analysis of borrowers progress reports and internal reporting.

The number of loan administration missions rose from 383
in 1983 to 428 in 1984, These were undertaken to assess the
progress of individual projects in the field, to deal with
specific problems and issues and to advise borrowers on
various aspects of project implementation. They consisted
of 17. project inception missions, 257 full review missions,
94 special loan administration missions, 22 country disbursement missions and 38 project completion missions.

The net value of contracts awarded in 1984 for all projects
amounted to $1 billion, compared with $726 million in 1983.

The 1984 figure includes $700 million for ordinary loans and
$303 million for Special Funds loans. On a cumulative basis,
the total contracts awarded up to the end of 1984 amounted
to $7.3 billion which is 56 per cent of effective loans.

Loan Disbursements

Loan disbursements serve as a major indicator of project
performance and actual resource transfers. in 1984,
disbursements amounted to $1,000.5 million, a 6.8 per cent
increase over the 1983 figure of $936.9 million. The increase
was due to a substantial increase in disbursements from ADF
resources to $298.3 million, 34.7 per cent above the 1983
figure of $221.5 million. Disbursements under ordinary loans
declined by 1.8 per cent from $715.4 million in 1983 to $702.2
Jnillion in 1984. On a cumulative basis up to the end of 1984,
the total amount disbursed was $6.4 billion, which was 49.5
per cent of effective foans.

The higher disbursements from ADF resources during 1984
were mainly attributable to increases ranging from 50 per
cent to 60 per cent in Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal and
Pakistan. Slower project implementation arising from
budgetary constraints in Malaysia and the Phitippines and
delays in contract awards in indonesia contributed in part
to the decline in disbursements from OCR in 1984. The accelerated disbursement program of $50 million for the Phitippines in 1983, of which $46 miifion was from OCR, had also
the effect of increasing OCR disbursements in that year as
compared to those in 1984.

Projects Completed

Twenty-one projects were completed in 1984, bringing the
total number of projects completed to 266 out of 656 projects
approved as of the end of the year. These completed projects
were mostly approved by the Bank in the mid-1970s, with the
earliest in 1871 and the most recent in 1979. Although many
of these projects experienced delays and cost overruns in
comparison with the cost and implementation schedutes envisaged at the time of their appraisal, a number were completed in near accordance with the original time and cost
schedules. Some examples of good implementation performance are the Bintuiu Deepwater Port Project in Malaysia
{a Project which cost over $200 million), the Machinery
Manufacturing and Applied Research Institutes Projects In
the Republic of Korea, the Upper Warangoi Hydropower Pro}ect in Papua New Guinea, the Fourth Port Project in
Indonesia, the First and Second Mae Moh Power Projects
in Thaliand and the Sha Tin Hospita!-Polyctinic Project in
Hong Kong. These examples are indicative of the improvements being made by the Bank and government executing agencies in project implementation.

Fifty-eight Project Gompietion Reports (PCRs) were completed in 1984. As of the end of 1984, a total of 166 PCRs had
been circulated to the Board of Directors. A summary of the
significant findings and conclusions contained in the PCRs
completed during the year is belng circulated to Bank staff
for information and guidance. It will also be reviewed and
analyzed in Project Performance Audit Reports to be prepared
by the Post-Evaluation Office.

Project Benefit Monitoring
and Evaluation

During 1984, Project Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation
(PBME) activities were systematically incorporated into those
project loans which produce goods and services which are
directly used by beneficiaries (for example, toans for irrigation, rural development, aquaculture and fisheries, livestock
and social forestry) under guidelines issued to Bank staff and
executing agencies. To ensure that the interests and
capabilities of beneficiaries are fully considered when formulating and appraising these projects, appropriate administrative arrangements were formulated and included in
the preparation procedures for agriculture, irrigation and rural
development projects. To help these projects produce the
expected benefits, project benefit monitoring systems were
incorporated into most irrigation and rural development projects approved during the year,

Pitot activities were continued with the irrigation departments of Indonesia and Thailand on standardized PBME approaches in preparing and implementing projects of these
agenctes. Work also began to facilitate the use of local consultants and consulting firms in this area.

Post-Evaluation

Post-evaluation of the Bank's first Multiproject loan and
completion of the Bank's first Impact Evaluation Studies as
well as two Special Studies were among the significant activities undertaken in 1984.

The Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) on the
Multiproject Loan to Tonga tended to confirm that such lending is appropriate considering the small size of individual
public sector projects in the South Pacific DMCs. Impact
Evaluation Studies on Sank assistance to the Fisheries sectors in Indonesia and Sri Lanka reviewed the technical,
economic, financial, institutional and socio-cultural impact
of the Bank’s completed projects in marine fisheries, and
considered implications for ongoing and future projects. A
Special Study on Executing Agency Arrangements examined
institutional factors that have affected project success and
implementation efficiency in 82 post-evaluated projects. A
Special Study on the Effectiveness of Project-Related
Technical Assistance raviewed the Bank’s experience with
granis and loans used mainly to finance consulting services
and training assistance related to specific projects.

The Bank's two-tier system of evaluating ail completed
projects remained essentially unchanged during the year. The
first tier consists of a Project Completion Report (PCR)
prepared by the project department responsible for the project’s preparation, appraisal and implementation, while the
second tier consists of a PPAR prepared by the PostEvaluation Office (PEO).

The number of PPARs prepared rose to 27 in 1984 from
24 in 1983. These 27 PPARs covered 36 projects in 12 sectors or subsectors of Bank operations in 11 DMCs: six
development bank projects {three in Republic of Korea, two
in Pakistan and one in Sri Lanka); five water supply and
sanitation projects (two In Papua New Guinea and one each
in Hong Kong, Republic of Korea and Philippines); four energy
projects (In Burma, Pakistan, Philippines and Sri Lanka);
three highway projects (In Nepal, Papua New Guinea and
Philippines); three Irrigation projects (in Republic of Korea,
Phillppines and Thailand); two port projects (in Pakistan and
Singapore); two industrial projects {in Pakistan and Tonga);
one agricultural credit project (in Nepal}; one urban deveiopment project (in the Republic of Korea); one fisheries project (in Thailand}; one alrport project (in the Philippines) and
one multiproject {in Tonga). As of the end of 1984, a cumutative total of 132 PPARs covering 139 projects had been
prepared.

The Sixth Review of Post-Evaiuation Reports (PERs) was
completed in 1984. it reviewed findings and conclusions of
24 PPARs prepared for 27 loan projects in 1983 and the
results of a Special Study on Regional Training Programs for
DFls. The loan projects (24, exciuding three loans to DFis)
resulted in a total investment of about $800 million, of which
Bank financing accounted for 44 per cent.

Twenty projects (74 per cent) were judged to have achieved
the objectives set at the time of appraisal, white the other
seven projects did so only partly. Factors affecting the performance of the seven partly successful projects varied from
one project to another. They included design problems, lessthan-expected improvement in institutional capacities and
the adverse effect of policy changes.

The Sixth Review also incorporated a summary analysis
of the 106 PERs prepared by the end of 1983. The analysis
was focused to reveal differences in project performance and
impact among country groups, inciuding low-income countries (Group A), lower middle-income countries (Group B) and
upper middle/high income countries (Group C). Major
physical accomplishments of these projects were summarized, common country issues identified and the strengths
and weaknesses of Bank involvement in those country groups
discussed.Technical Assistance
and Regional Activities

During 1984, the Bank provided $22.1 million in technical
assistance, including technical assistance for regional activities, for 109 projects compared with $25.3 million for 107
projects in 1983,.representing a marginal Increase of 1.9 per
cent in number and a decrease of 12.8 per cent in amount.
Of this, $18.4 million was for project preparatory and
advisory/operational technical assistance for 84 projects in
18 DMCs, compared with $19.6 million for 77 projects in 19
BMGs in 1983.

Technical Assistance for DMCs

In recent years, about 41 per cent of the Bank’s total
technical assistance has been for project preparation, 43 per
cent for advisory and operational purposes and 16 per cent
for regional activities.

During 1984, project preparatory technical assistance
totalled $8.2 million for 45 projects, while advisory and operational technical assistance totalled $10.2 million for 39 projects. These amounts included technical assistance grant
components totalling $4.8 million given in conjunction with
14 Bank loans, all of which were for advisory and operational,
inciuding implementation, purposes.

Technical assistance granis are financed mainly from the
Bank's Technical Assistance Special Fund (see page 139).
In addition, the Bank acts as Executing Agency for technical
assistance projects financed from other sources, both
multilateral and bilateral, such as the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), the European Economic
Community (EEC) and the Government of Switzerland. The
Bank .also cooperates with the Food and Agriculture
Organization/Investment Center (FAO/IC) on a cost-sharing
basis in providing technical assistance for the preparation
of agricultural projects.

the Bank acting as Executing Agency. These comprised
seven projects for $2.9 million from UNDP, two projects for
$550,000 from the Government of Switzerland and one project for $250,000 from EEC. Six other projects received
assistance from FAO and one project from the Internatlonal
Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) on a cost-sharing
basis.

Eighteen OMCs received project preparatory and advisory
and operational technical assistance from the Bank in 1984.
This amounted to $18.4 milllon for 84 projects. Technica!
assistance provided to South Pacific DMCs during the year
totalled $3.7 miition for 19 projects, compared with $2.8
million for 16 projects in 1983.

On a sectorai basis, 45.8 per cent of the total amount of
technical assistance to DMCs approved in 1984 was for
Agricutture and Agro-Industry, compared with 50.2 per cent
in 1983. Technica! assistance In this sector supported, among
other activities, irrigation, rural development, forestry,
livestock, fisheries, smallholder agriculture, aquacuiture, area
development, fruit and vegetable storage and cotton development. About 18.1 per cent was provided to the Transport and
Communications sector; 12.3 per cent to the Energy sector,
manly for rural electrification and mini-hydropower development; 6 per cent to Development Banks; and the rest to
industry and Non-Fuel Minerals and Socia! infrastucture,

The importance of technicai assistance to the Bank's lending program is underscored by the fact that by the end of
1984 a@ total of 275 Bank loan projects amounting to $6,830
million had resulted from earlier Bank technical assistance
amounting to $80.4 million. in 1984 alone, 26 loan projects
amounting to $1,193 million resulted from eartier technical
assistance. Of this, $752 million came from OCR and $441
million from SF, representing 48.5 per cent and 64.5 per cent,
respectively, of the year’s total loan approvals from these
sources, Technical assistance is particularly Important to
those DMCs which are fully eligible for SF lending. They
received $10 million for 44 technical assistance projects
during the year, which is 54 per cent in amount and 49 per
cent in number of all technical assistance provided to DMCs
by the Bank in 1984.

Sixty-five technical assistance projects, mostly approved
in previous years, were completed in 1984, 43 for project
preparation, 12 for advisory and operational purposes and
ten for regional projects, bringing the total number of
technical assistance projects completed to 442, as of the end
of 1984. The total amount of technical assistance granis provided to DMCs, including regional activities, stood at $169.4
million.

Regional Activities

During the year, the Bank undertook a number of regional
activities. The more important of these are given below;
‘others are listed in the table on page 131.

Sympeslum on European Enterprise and the Asian
Challenge: A two-day international symposium on this topic
was held on 24 and 25 April In conjunctlon with the Annual
Meeting of the Board of Governors in Amsterdam. It was cosponsored by the Bank and ten major banks from eight European countries. The maln speakers included Dr. W, de Clerca,
Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Foreign
Commerce of Belgium; Prof. Dr. Ali Wardhana, Minister CoorGinator for the Economy, Finance, Industry and Development
Supervision of indonesia; Dr. H.O. Ruding, Minister of
Finance of the Netherlands; Dr. W.F. Duisenberg, President
of De Nederlandsche Bank; and Bank President Masao
Fujioka. After a general session devoted to broad issues,
three workshops were conducted on European-Asian
economic cooperation In the flelds of agribusiness, construction engineering and energy.

Development Round Table on Industrial Development and
Trade Policy: The Bank provided $110,000 for a workshop
at which eminent experts and senior government officials
directly concerned with industrial development and trade
policy could exchange views and experiences, The Round
Table, heid from 29 October to 8 November In Tokyo In
association with the Japan Center for International Finance,
was attended by senior policy makers in the fields of industry
and trade from ii of the Bank’s member countries.

Study of Food Demand and Supply and Related Strategles
for DMCs (Phase fi): Following completion of the first phase
in May, $650,000 was approved for the second phase of this
Study, focusing on the Philippines and indonesia. The Philippines will be assisted in developing and refining plans to help
achieve self-sufficiency in rice and corn and in diversifying
agricultural production. For Indonesia, the Study wil] examine
key areas of government involvement in food crop production and identify areas of activity to which the Governmen*
should give greater priority. The Study will assess the
medium and long-term balance of supply and demand for rice
and other food crops, evaluate the role and impact of pricing
policies and other market intervention activities, and determine the regional comparative advantage of different type
of irrigation-based food production development activities.

Conference on Privatization Policies, Methods and Procedures: in order to help DMCs explore the scope for
privatization of public enterprises, the Bank approved a
$148,000 technical assistance grant for a conference In
January 1985 on privatization of public enterprises for toplevel government officials and senior executives in the private
sector.Seminar on Domestic Resource Mobilization Through
Financial Development: Twelve financial experts from
seven countries participated in this Seminar, held from 19
ta 21 November at Bank Headquarters under a $66,000 grant.

In discussions and papers, the participants concluded that
since national savings have financed the bulk of investment
in Asian nations, it is becoming necessary for developing
countries to raise such savings by improving the capacity
and efficiency of their financial systems. The importance of
savings for growth derives from the fact that savings finance
investment — capital formation — and this is a key determinant of a country’s growth rate.

Moreover, a country’s rate of economic growth depends
not only on the rate of capital formation but also on the efficiency with which capital is used. In this respect, the
mobilization of domestic resources involves inducing an increase in the proportion of national income saved and insuring that savings are allocated efficiently among alternative
investment possibilities.

Regional Seminar on Rural Development: The Seminar,
held in October, discussed priorities for the Bank's future
operations in rural development and recommended ways to
improve the project formulation and implementation
capabilities of both the Bank and its DMCs. Participants in
the Seminar, for which the Bank approved $200,000, included 32 senior government officiais invoived in planning and
managing rural development projects in 17 DMCs. The
deliberations focused on the most critical issues for future
policy dialogue, and will provide a foundation for the preparation of a sector paper on rural development in 1985.

Regionat Agricultural Research: The Bank expanded its
support for regional agricuftural research through continued
contacts with Consultative Group on fnternational
Agricultural Research (CGIAR) institutions. in 1984, a regional
technical assistance grant of $350,000 was provided to the
{nternational Rice Research institute to support research and
training on rice virus diseases.

Research Activities

During the year, several major studies were completed.
These included Domestic Resource Mobilization through
Financial Development (in selected Asian countries), the
Significance of Off-Farm Employment and Incomes in PosiWar East Asian Growth, Income Distribution and Poverty in
Selected Asian Countries, ASEAN Economies and ASEAN
Economic Cooperation. in the methodological field, a study
on the Economic Evaluation Methodology for Power Sector
Projects was completed and guidelines based on its recommendations will be prepared. Work was also undertaken in
developing guidelines for the Economic Evaluation of Education Projects.

In addition, short papers were prepared on a variety of subjects including Changing Trade Patterns and Policy tssues:
The Prospects. for East and Southeast Asian Developing
Countries, Small-Scale Industries in Asian Economic
Development: Problems and Prospects, A Study on the External Debt Indicators Applying Logit Analysis, Alternatives
to Institutional Credit Programs in the Agricultural Sector of

. Inter-Agency Cooperation

The Bank maintained and strengthened Its links with
various international organizations concerned with the social
and economic progress of the Asia-Pacific region in 1984.
Financial collaboration took place with the World Bank Group
(which provided co-financing totalling $359 million for five
projects). the OPEC Fund for International Development
($11.5 million in co-financing for two projects), the Isiamic
Development Bank ($10.7 million in co-financing for one project}, the United Nations Development Programme ($2 million
in grants for four projects, with the Bank acting as Executing
Agency for three projects financed whoily or partly by UNDP
with $0.9 million}, and.the European Economic Community
($250,000 in financing for one technical assistance project).
in addition, the Food and Agriculture Organization/investment Center provided $410,000 for five projects on a costsharing basis.

The President of the Bank attended meetings of the international Financial (nstitutions and the Development Committee in September in Washington, D.C. During the year, the
Bank participated in aid group meetings for Bangladesh,
Burma, India, indonesia, Republic of Korea, Pakistan, Philippines and Sri Lanka.

Bilateral cooperation was strengthened through visits by
several delegations from aid agencies. These visits helped
increasé co-financing with bilateral aid agencies from $68
million for six projects in 1983 to $348 million for 13 projects
in 1984,

Country Activities

Bangladesh

Operational Strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy in
Bangladesh centers on agriculture, energy and human
resources. In the Agriculture sector, attention is being paid
to broadening the production base by diversifying crops,
developing non-crop subsectors and strengthening linkages
between agriculture and industry. Physical and social infrastructure investments are almed at supporting and complementing the Bank’s emphasis on agriculture. In the Energy
sector, the Bank seeks to improve energy supplies by using
existing capacities more efficiently and developing indigenous energy resources. Human resource development
is stressed through continued emphasis on institutional support in individual Bank-financed projects and through support for education projects.

Loans and Technical Asststance: In 1984, the Bank
approved four loans from ADF to Bangladesh totailing $306.8
million, compared with six loans amounting to $273.5 million
in 1983, Financing the local costs of projects accounted for
$45.2 million, or 14.7 per cent, of Bank fending to Bangladesh
during the year. Of the four projects financed by the Bank,
three involved co-financing totalling $48 million, with UNDP,
the Norweglan Agency for international Development
{NORAD}, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

While past lending has emphasized agriculture, in 1984 the
Energy sector accounted for 73 per cent of total Bank jending to Bangladesh during the year. The two energy loans,
totalling $223.8 million, emphasize more efficient use of
power supplies and institutional development (Sixth Power
Sector Loan) and development of indigenous energy sources

a shortage of skilled scientific and technical manpower
which is hampering the country's development. in the
Transport sector, Bank assistance is directed at improving
the efficiency of the railways (Second Raitway) by rationalizing operations and strengthening institutional capabilities.

Three project preparatory technical assistance grants (Second Aquaculture Development, Road Maintenance and
Rehabilitation Sector, and Chhatak Cement Plant Rehabilitation} were also approved by the Bank in 1984. In addition, the
Bank is acting as the Executing Agency for advisory and
operational technical assistance grants for the Second
Ratlway Project and an Inter-Modal Transport Study funded
by UNDP.

As of the end of 1984, the Bank had approved 60 loans
amounting to $1,626.3 million to Bangladesh for 54 projects.
it had also provided technical assistance totalling $26.7
miltion for 70 projects, of which 28 had resulted in Bank loans
amounting to $962.7 million. The Agriculture sector had accounted for nearly one-haif of total cumulative fending to
Bangladesh and the Energy sector for 31 per cent.

Project Implementation: Of the 60 foans made to
Bangladesh as of 3} December 1984, 17 had been fully
disbursed and completed and 43 were under administration,
of which five were awaiting loan effectivity. Disbursements
totalled $77.7 miilion during 1984, compared with $48.6
miilion in 1983. One loan was closed and four PCRs were
prepared during the year. Cumulative disbursements of Bank
loans at the end of December 1984 amounted to $378.9

Resident Office in Bangladesh and together with other donor
agencies, has helped the Government tc identify and resolve
project implementaiion issues, in addition, the Government
and the Bank agreed in 1884 to hoid bi-annual Country Projects Review Meetings to discuss maiters related io the impiementation of Bank-assisted projects in Bangladesh and
io acceleraie loan disbursements. Such meetings focus on
country-specific implementation probiems ana constraints
and also deat with project-specific issues.

Bhutan

Operational Strategy: ‘!n Bhutan’s present stage of
development and economic potential, the long-term obiectives of Bank lending and technical assistance operations
are to heip increase agricultural productivity, promote the
development of physical and social infrastructure and assist
the process of economic diversification. The Bank will also
pay increasing attention to institution building in order to
strengthen the planning, project implementation and monitoring capacity of the Government.

Loan and Technical Assistance: in 1984, the Bank
financed a $7.4 million Muitiproject oan to Bhutan from ADF.
The proceeds of this loan will be used to improve the living
standards in six major urban areas by expanding and
renabilitating water supply services and providing low-cost
sanitation, as well as to establish a management institute
to help deveicp managerial, accounting and clerical manpower required by the public and private sectors. The Bank
also approved three technical assistance projects in 1984,
ior irrigation activities and for a study of the industrial sector and feasibility of an industrial finance mechanism.

The Multiproiect loan was the Bank’s second such loan
to Bhutan since ii became a member in 1982. Technical
assistance to date totals $1.4 million for eight projects.

Project Impiementation: The first Multiproject loan
became effective in January 1984 and is being implemented
on schedule. This being the first 1oan to Bhutan, unfamiliarity
with the Bank’s requirements, practices and procedures and
undermanning of project offices, have caused some minor
problems in project impiementation. The participation of officials in Bank-sponsored seminars on project implementation Management and procurement in 1984 is, however, expecied to improve the situation.

Burma

Operational Strategy: The Bank's lending program in
Burma supports the objectives and priorities of the country’s
Fourth Four-Year Plan (1982/83-1985/86}. The main strategy
of the Plan is to consolidate gains achieved in earlier plans
with an emphasis on agriculture, the main vehicle for
transforming the economy. The Bank endorses the Government’s strategy of increasing investment for post-harvest activities and for intensified production and qualitative improvements in non-paddy crops. The Bank continues to support other selected areas In such sectors as Industry, Energy,
Transportation and Water Supply. Institution buffding also
is stressed, to ease institutional and manpower constraints
on Burma’s capacity io absorb development assistance.

Loan and Technical Assistance: {n 1984, a $10 million
loan was approved by the Bank from ADF for the Myanma
Economie Bank (MEB). The loan will be onlent to small and
medium-scale industrlal enterprises in Burma for thelr
medium and fong-term credit requirements. An Important
component of this Project Is an advisory technical assistance
grant designed to improve the project evaluation and supervisory capability of MEB, a major supporter of Industrlal activities in Burma.

In addition, the Bank provided technical assistance to
prepare an Oliseed Production and Processing Project. The
$450,000 grant was financed by UNDP, with the Bank acting
as Executing Agency.

To date, the Bank has provided 31 loans io Burma totailing $495.9 million including two loans, amounting to $6.6
miillon, from OCR and 29 icans, amounting to $489.3 million,
from ADF. Technical assistance totalting $8.2 miliion has
been provided for 30 projects, of which 14 have resulted in
Bank loans amounting to $351.8 million. The Agriculture sector has accounted for 57 per cent of total cumulative Bank
lending to Burma.

Delays in recruiting consultants and problems in procurement of goods and services have generally been encountered
in the implementation of projects. A requirement that
seaborne imports be carried by national flag vessels and a
reluctance to submit shipping charges to competitive bidding were two issues that have hampered procurement in the
past. A nationwide scarcity of diesel fuel and cement was
also a major problem, although recent government moves
to augment the supply of these two vital materials, especially
for externaily funded development projects, have helped considerably to keep projects moving.

Fiji

Operational Strategy: The main emphasis in the Bank's
lending strategy in Fiji has shifted from energy (principally
the development of domestic energy sources) to support the
Government's long-term development objectives. These include diversifying the productive base of the country and
diminishing the economy’s current over-dependence on sugar
and tourism. Another goal is economic self-reliance to relieve
growing pressures on-the balance of payments. Three areas
of strategic importance for Bank assistance are the deveiopment of supportive infrastructure for agriculture, the
strengthening of national institutions and the broadening of
the agricultural base, including fisheries and forestry.

Loan and Technical Assistance: in 1984, the Bank
approved a loan of $3.2 million for an Agricultural Deveiopment Project from OCR. The Project is aimed at intensitying the use of agricultural lands for rice, rootcrops anc
vegetable production and building all-weather access roads.

During 1984; Bank staff visited India to establish contacts
and discuss with appropriate Government agencies and officiais India’s request to commence borrowing from the Bank.
Studies were undertaken in the fertilizer, ports and power
subsectors to assess where assistance would be of priority.

Indonesia

Operational Strategy: Agriculture, energy and manpower
development receive priority in the Bank's operational
strategy in Indonesia. in the Agriculture sector, Bank
assistance continues to support the Government’s objective
of achieving self-sufficiency in food, but emphasis is increasingly shifting to projects designed to diversity the agricultural
base and optimize resource use. In the Energy sector, Bank
policy supports the Government's plan to develop non-oil and
renewable resources to lessen dependence on oll. Bank
assistance to manpower and institutional development in
Indonesia carries special significance, as trained and skilled
manpower is limited and educational institutions require
strengthening. in addition, on a selective basis, the Bank continues to help develop roads and ports to improve transport
within and among the country’s islands, and water supply
and health care to meet the basic needs of lower-income
groups.

Loans and Technical Assistance: Bank jending to
indonesia totalled $587 million from OCR in 1984, compared
with $426.15 million in 1983. A total of nine loans were approved in 1984, including two sector loans (one each in the
fisheries and roads subsectors). Local cost financing accounted for $100.5 million, or about 17 per cent, of Bank lending to the country during the year. Three projects involved
co-financing, totatling $57.2 million, with the Saudi Fund for
Development (two projects) and the Islamic Development
Bank {one}.

Agriculture accounted for 51 per cent of the Bank’s lending to Indonesia during 1984. The five loans in the Agriculture
sector helped finance irrigation, estate crops, livestock and
fisheries projects. Two projects in the Transport sector —
one for roads and the other for a port — will augment intra
and inter-island transport finks. An education project, for
development of senior technical schools, will help ease conStraints in trained manpower faced by the country. A noteworthy feature of the lending program is the approval by the

There have been significant delays in implementing certain Bank-assisted projects in Indonesia. The Government
and.the Bank have, since 1982, heid tri-annual Country Projects Review Meetings in Jakarta. In addition to reviewing ai!
Bank-assisted projects under implementation, these
meetings also focused on project-specific issues and sectoral problems originating from policy directives and procedural requirements. As a result, a number of implementation problems were resolved and agreements were reached
on the streamlining and relaxation of certain requirements
and procedures.

Korea, Republic of

Operational Strategy: Korea's growth prospects depend
on its ability to maintain its economic position amid increasing competition from other newly industrializing countries
as well as protectionism in many of its markets. Endowed
with only limited material resources, the country’s ability to
sustain export momentum will continue to depend on the
dynamic role of the private sector and is likely to hinge on
its success in adopting skill-intensive technologies which
make the most effective use of its manpower. The Bank’s
operational strategy for the Republic of Korea supports the
increasingly important role of the private sector as part of
the Government's industrial restructuring program and the
development of industrial technology. Particular attention
is also given to the needs of the smali and medium-sized industries which continue to play a significant role in the
economy. Another key element in the country’s industrial
restructuring, in view of its dependence on imported fuels,
is energy conservation and efficient use of energy resources,
The Bank continues to support these efforts by assisting
energy-related projects. Assistance is also provided on a
selective basis for basic social infrastructure projects which
promote broader distribution of the benefits of economic
development.

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1984, the Bank approved four ioans totalling $174 million from OCR to the
Republic of Korea, compared with three loans amounting to
$193 million in 1983.

The Water Supply sector received two loans — the Eighth
and Ninth Water Supply Projects — amounting to $94 million
or 54 per cent of the year's total lending, In the Energy sector, the Seoul-Incheon Natural Gas Distribution Project will
help develop a distribution system for liquefied natural gas
to be imported from indonesia beginning in 1987. The Bank’s
third loan for the Citizens National Bank will assist smallscale industries in the private sector across the country.

The Bank’s technical assistance program in the Republic
of Korea in 1984 consisted of three project preparatory grants
{Seoul-incheon Natural Gas Distribution, Water Supply and
Sanitation Sector Profile and Ninth Water Supply) and one
advisory and operational grant {Gas Pricing Study). Together,
they totalled $286,000.

By the end of 1984, the Bank had approved 71 loans totalling $1,949.5 mifiion to the Republic of Korea. Of these, 70
loans ($1,945.8 million) were from OGR and one ($3.7 million)
was from ADF. The Bank’s first equity investment in the country, amounting to $0.96 million equivaient, was approved in
December 1983. The Bank had also provided 21 project
preparatory and five advisory and operational technicat
assistance grants. totalling $3.9 milllon, 16 of which had
resulted in 20 Bank loans amounting to $686.5 mlilion. Of the
Bank's total lending, two-thirds has been in sectors directly
supporting the country’s indusirialization efforts — Industry,
Development Banks, Energy and Transport. In recent years,
the Government has aiso increased investment In the Social
infrastructure sector. This change in emphasis !s reflected
In the Bank's lending since 1979, during which period over
one-third of its assistance has been for social Infrastructure.

Project Implementation: As of the end of 1984, of the 71
loans approved to the Republic of Korea, 43 had been fully
disbursed and completed, and 28 were under administration
including three that were awaiting effectivity. Disbursements
totalled $136.5 million during 1984, compared with $124.1

prepared during the year. Cumulative disbursements of Sank
loans at the end of 1984 totalled $1,196.9 million or 69.9 per
cent of the total amount of effective foans.

Except for budgetary constraints which occaslonally
delayed payments to contractors in certain projects, there
were no major problems encountered in 1984. As regards DFI
loans, there was a slowdown in demand for foreign currency during the year due to a Government-mandated reduction
in the lending rate of local currency loans and stiff competltion from commercial banks.

to Lao PDR in 1984 to prepare a feasibility study of a Second
Road Smprovement Project, to provide consulting services
to improve the institutional capabilities of the four enterprises which will implement the Second Forestry Development Project, and to help establish a Project Implementation Advisory Services Unit. This Unit is expected to
significantly benefit projects financed by the Bank and other
donors in the country. In addition, the Bank is acting as Ex
-ecuting Agency for an advisory technical assistance financed

by UNDP for the ongoing Bank-financed Vientiane Plain Road
Improvement Project.

To date, the Bank had provided 12 loans for ten projects
amounting to. $60.14 million in Lao PDR, all from ADF.
Technical! assistance totalling $6 million had been provided
for 22 projects, of which nine have resulted in Bank loans
amounting to $48.1 million. The sectoral distribution of
cumulative Bank lending reflected the emphasis given to
developing forest-based Industries for export, stimulating activities in rural areas and developing energy resources for
both domestic use and export.

Project Implementation: in Lao PDR, of the 12 loans approved, five had been fully disbursed and completed, andseven were under administration at the end of 1984, of which
two were awaiting loan effectivity. Disbursements totalled
$2.0 million during 1984, compared with $4.4 million in 1983.
Gne PCR was prepared during the year. Cumulative
disbursements of Bank foans at the end of 1984 amounted
to $24.5 million or 56.6 per cent of the total amount of effective loans.

Bank operations in Lao PDR were fully resumed in 1983
after a break of almost two years. Major constraints in project implementation that were experienced included inadequate communications facilities, shortage of skilled personnel and trained administrators, inadequate foreign exchange,
budgetary limitations and trade restrictions. To help the
Government better implement development projects, the
Bank approved a technical assistance grant in 1984 for the
strengthening of the Project Implementation Advisory Services Unit.

Malaysia

Operational Strategy: In Malaysia, the Bank’s operational
strategy supports the main objective of the National
Economic Policy — fostering structural change by redressing economic and social imbalances. Two areas of prime importance are eradicating poverty and developing energy. The
Bank has adopted a multifaceted approach to help meet the

challenge of poverty eradication through assistance to .

agriculture, manpower development and social infrastructure. In agriculture, the Bank is guided by the objectives of
the Nationaj Agricuitural Policy to improve farm productivity and diversify the income of farmers; manpower development is supported through rehabilitating and expanding
technical and vocational educational Institutions; and basic
needs of the poor are provided through social infrastructure
facilities. in the Energy sector, exploiting the country’s considerable natural gas reserves, developing hydroelectric

highest priorities of the Government and are supported by.
the Bank. Another important area is the development of ports
to facilitate exports. The Bank's future strategy will assist,
at the Government's initiative, plans to develop the private
sector of the economy and “privatize” selected public sector enterprises.

Loans and Technical Assistance: Bank lending to
Malaysia amounted to $159.9 million from OCR in 1984, compared with $82.5 million in 1983. A total of four loans — including one sector loan — were approved, two in the
Agriculture sector for smailholder development and utilization of forestry resources and one each for a port and
hydropower project. This pattern’ is consistent with the
Bank’s overall fending strategy in Malaysia. Two projects involved co-financing totalling $85.5 million ($30 million from
the Saudi Fund for Development and $55.5 million from commercial sources), constituting 53.4 per cent of the year’s total
lending. Local cost financing accounted for $7.4 million, or
4.6 per cent of Bank lending to Mataysia in 1984.

Five technical assistance grants totalling $1.08 million
were approved in 1984, compared with three grants totalling
$650,000 in 1983. Advisory and operational technical assistance amounted to $430,000 for two projects. Four projects
were agricultural and the other supported a health services
financing study.

As of the end of 1984, the Bank had approved 55 loans

development and parily the more recent thrust in agriculture
and social infrastructure development. Consequently, the
portfolio of Bank-assisted projects in Malaysia is spread
relatively eventy among sectors.

Project Implementation: Of the 55 loans approved to
Malaysia, 32 had been fully disbursed and completed, and
23 were under administration at the end of 1984, including
four foans that were awaiting loan effectivity. Disbursements
totalled $44.4 million during 1984, compared with $58.8
million in 1983. Two loans were closed and four PCRs were
prepared during the year. Cumulative disbursemenis of Bank
foans at the end of December 1984 totalled $478.4 million,
or 58.4 per cent of the total amount of effective loans.

Historically, implementation of Bank-financed projects in
Malaysia has been satisfactory. During 1984, however, the
progress of several projects was hindered by budgetary constraints, particularly for agricultural projects. Start-ups in construction were slow in some projects, mainly because of initial delays in recruiting consultants, prequalifying contractors and procuring equipment.

Maldives

Operational Strategy: The Bank's assistance program in
the Maldives has focused on transpost, communications and
power infrastructure. Multiproject loans, which are appropriate for Maldives’ small economy, have also been included, Partly because other donor sources are meeting the
country’s short-term needs and partly because the Bank can
more purposefully support longer-term requirements, project
assistance — provided particularly for infrastructure and
geared to the Maldives’ absorptive capacity —~ continues to
be emphasized.

Loan and Technical Assistance: In 1984, the Bank
financed a $2.38 million Multiproject Loan from ADF in the
Maldives covering five subprojects: (I} developing of a new
commercial harbor in the capital of Male; (i) deepening priori
ty harbors in atoll islands; (iii) providing meteorologicat equipment; (iv) upgrading the power supply in Male; and (v) electrifying two atoil islands. Advisory technical assistance was
provided for the appraisal of subprojects under the Muitiproject Loan. The Project atso includes preparing a feasibility
study for a telecommunications project.

The Bank had previously provided one ADF loan of $1
million in 1981 for an inter-island transport project. In addition, the Bank has provided iwo technical assistance grants:
to prepare a feasibility study for the inter-isiand project, and
to help formulate a national development plan. The Bank's
technical assistance to date amounis to $483,000.

Project Implementation: Disbursements totalled $0.03
milllon during 1984, compared with $6.7 million In 1983.
Cumulative disbursements of Bank loans at the end of 1984
amounted to $0.8 million, or 23.5 per cent of the total amount
of effective ioans.

Nepal

Operational Stratagy: Agriculture is the prime focus of
the Bank's operational strategy in Nepal, helping to ensure
food setf-sufficiency, increase food intake and reverse the
decline In exportable food supplies. This general objective
is pursued through broadly based strengthening of the
Agriculture sector and crop intensification aimed at significantly increasing productivity. Particutar emphasis is
placed on constructing Irrigation facilities, developing rural
Infrastructure including electrification, providing agricultural
inputs and agricultural credit and reversing ecological
detertoration. At this stage of Nepal's development, Bank
lending to the non-agricultural sectors basicatly supports the
development of agriculture in a way that ensures satisfactory linkage with other sectors while assisting the long-term
diversification of the economy.

Loans and Technical Assistance: Bank lending to Nepal
amounted to $60.7 million from ADF in 1984, compared with
$82.7 million in 1983. A total of four loans were approved in
1984. They are designed to improve agricultural productivity In the Hill areas; extend the country’s power transmission
and distribution system; and provide safe water to rural communities in the Mid and Far-Western regions. In addition, a

with Kreditanstalt fiir Wiederaufbau (KfW) on behaif of the
Government of the Federal Republic of Germany.

The Bank also provided $1.1 million in technical assistance
for five projects in 1984. Project preparatory technical
assistance totalled $635,006 for three projects and advisory
and operational technical assistance amounted to $441,000
for two projects. Three projects were agricultural and agroindustry activities (oné each in livestock, aquaculture and
cotton development), one was an industrial sector study and
one provided advisory services for rural water supply.

To date, the Bank had approved 44 loans totalling $440.3
million for 36 projects in Nepal. All but one loan have been
from ADF. In addition, technical assistance amounting to
$21.1 million for 63 projects had been provided or administered by the Bank. Of the 35 project preparatory technical
assistance projects, 22 have resulted in Bank loans totalling
$254.6 million. Most of the Bank's cumulative lending to
Nepal has been directed toward the Agriculture and Energy
seciors which together account for about 70 per cent of the
Bank’s loan portfolio.

Project Implementation: {n Nepal, of the 44 loans
approved, 13 had been fully disbursed and completed, and
31 were under administration as of the end of 1884, including
four that were awaiting loan effectivity. Disbursements

Project implementation in Nepal is hampered by inadequate technical and managerial capabilities, complicated administrative procedures, frequent transfers of project personnel and slow appointment of replacement staff. Delays have
also occurred in processing contracts, recruiting consultants,
appointing local counterpart staff and in delivering imported
equipment and supplies for projects.

Serious efforts are being undertaken to deal with these
problems and the Bank, at the request of the Government,
has agreed to hold bi-annual Country Projects Review
Meetings with senior finance and planning officials to heip
expedite implementation of Bank-assisted projects in Nepal.
The first of such meetings is scheduled for early 1985.

Pakistan

Operational Strategy: !n Pakistan, the Bank’s operational
strategy supports the objectives and priorities of the country’s Sixth Five-Year Plan. Under the Plan, structural adjustment is directed toward improving export performance, slowing the growth in petroleum imports and increasing substitution for non-fuel imports. The private sector is expected to
play an increasing role in activities which are directly productive, supported by necessary physical infrastructure provided by the public sector. The Government's ‘strategy is
based on qualitative changes in the macro and sectoral
policy framework, which include input/output price adjustmenis to improve producer incentives, tariff revisions to
rationalize the structure of effective protection of appropriate
industries and import liberalization of capital and intermediate inputs to aid industrial production.

The Bank’s strategy in this context is to support the process of economic restructuring by transferring financial
resources to key sectors and it emphasizes improvements
in the institutional framework, efficient use of resources and

45stronger incentives to stimulate Increased production for export and for import substitution. if these main objectives are
met, the supplementary objectives of poverty alleviation and
regional development can be achieved through income creation. Sectorally, the Bank provides major support for the
development of Energy {resources and infrastructure) and InGustry — the two sectors best suited to provide the necessary
development thrust over the medium term — while maintaining an involvement in Agriculture at a level compatible with
that sector's absorptive capacity.

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1984, Bank lending
to Pakistan amounted to $347 million ($209.8 million from
ADF and $137.2 million from OCR) for four projects, compared
with $312.1 million ($185.3 million from ADF and $126.8
million from OCR} for four projects in 1983. Locai cost financing accounted for $57.6 million, or 16.6 per cent, of total Bank
lending to Pakistan during the year. Three of the four projects approved in 1984 involved co-financing totatling $383
million with various muitilateral and bilateral donors.

The lending program in 1984 Included two agricultural projects, a hydropower project and a health and population project. In the Agriculture sector, the Bank participated with $122
million in co-financing the Left Bank Outfall Drain (Stage })
Project, a major undertaking aimed at reversing the deterioration of land in the Lower Indus Basin. It also approved a $40
million concessional loan for the Chashma Command Area
Development Project, which is designed to increase the efficiency of irrigation facitities, expand crop production and
improve social and economic conditions In Northwest Frontier Province. In energy, the Bank acted as lead agency in
appraising and arranging co-financing for the Tarbela

In addition, the Bank approved a direct equity investment
of Rs6 million ($420,000} in the National Development Leasing Corporation Ltd., the first company to provide lease
financing in the country.

The Bank has so far provided 70 loans totatling $2,112.5
million for 53 projects. Of these, 31 joans amounting to $876.4
million (414 per cent} were from OCR and 39 joans amounting
to $t,236.1 million (59 per cent) from ADF. Technicat
assistance totalling $7.95 million has been provided for 39
projects, of which 15 have resulted in Bank loans amounting
to $704.8 million. Bank lending has emphasized the Energy
sector, which accounts for 42 per cent of total cumulative
lending to Pakistan, and the Development Banks and
Agriculture and Agro-Industry sectors, which account for
about 24 per cent each.

Project Implementation: Of the 70 toans approved to
Pakistan, 26 had been fully disbursed and completed, and
44 were under administration at the end of 1984, of which
six were awaiting loan effectivity. Disbursements totailed
$163.1 million during 1984, compared with $120.4 million in
1983. Three loans were closed and seven PCRs were prepared
during the year. Cumulative disbursements of Bank loans at
the end of December 1984 amounted to $776.8 million or 46.7
per cent of the total amount of effective loans.

Delays were experienced in the impiementation of projects
in the Agriculture, Water Supply and Social Infrastructure
sectors. These were caused by occasional lack of consensus between federal and provincia! authorities on the priority to be attached to individual projects, internal government
procedures for project approval, slow appointment of consultants, frequent changes in government policies and turnover of managerial and technical staff arising mainly because
of better job opportunities in the Middle East. Since 1983,

the Government and the Bank have held regular semi-annual
meetings to discuss implementation problems and to review
problem projects at the highest administrative level. These
greatly facilitated the solution of some problems and expedition of disbursements over the last two years.

Papua New Guinea

Operational Strategy: Within the framework of the
Government’s development objectives and priorities, the
basic thrust of the Bank's overall lending strategy in PNG
is geared towards: (i) strengthening and expanding the
agricultural base of the economy; (ii) harnessing the couniry’s indigenous energy resources; (iii) developing essential
infrastructure to support development of priority sectors; and
{iv} strengthening institutional capacity by developing human
resources.

Loah and Technical Assistance: in 1984, the Bank provided a blended sector loan of $33.25 million to PNG, compared with $28 million for two projects in 1983. The proceeds
of the loan, comprising $18.25 million from OCR and $15
million from ADF, will be used to improve priority roads and
provide consulting services for preparing subprojects anda
future roads investment program. The 1984 technical
assistance program to PNG totalled $1.62 million for eight
projects — four advisory and four project preparatory. Sectorally, two projects were in the Agriculture sector, two in
Transport, one each in Energy, Health and Education and one
for the preparation of a medium-term national planning
system.

. Asofthe end of 1984, the Bank-had approved 20 loans to
PNG totalling $198.1 million for 16 projects. Of these loans,
eight, amounting to $87.2 million, were from OCR and 12,
amounting to $110.9 million, were from ADF, Technical
assistance totalling $4 million had been provided for 24 projects, of which four had resulted in Bank loans amounting
to $54.74 million. The Transport and Communications sector has accounted for 46 per cent of total cumulative Bank

Most projects in Papua New Guinea have faced start-up
problems due to staffing constraints, Institutional weak
nesses and initial delays in procurement and recruitment of
consultants. Frequent rotation of project staff, many of whom
are expatriates emnptoyed on a contract basis, caused interruptions in project activities. Moreover, the provincial governmenis, to whom responsibility for project implementation has
been delegated, do not have sufficient capability for this kind
of work.

Philippines

Operational Strategy: Bank operations in the Philippines
during 1984 were adapted to assist the country in a period
of extreme economic uncertainty and difficulty and severe
domestic resource constraints. The Bank continues to be
rasponsive to the country’s more immediate needs but, at
the same time, it will need to direct assistance toward longerterm development requirements. The Bank supports the
Government's expanded efforts to develop agriculture by
diversifying crops and incomes and promoting exports and
impost substitution. Developing indigenous energy resources
continues to occ upy high priority. Emphasis is given to making existing productive assets more efficient by rehabilitating
where conditions warrant, and strengthening operations and
maintenance capabilities in general.

Loans and Technical Assistance: in 1984, the Bank approved four ioans from OCR to the Philippines totalling $275.9
million, compared with seven loans amounting to $234.54
million in 1983. Local cost financing accounted for $18.2
miilion, or 6.5 per cent, of Bank lending to the Philippines
in 1984. One project (Second Power System Development)
involved co-financing of $3.1 million with a US commercial
bank, guaranteed by the US Export-Import Bank.

The Bank, in mid-December 1983, authorized and disbursed
$50 million out of current toans meant to be disbursed during the course of 1984 to finance focal cost expenditures for
various ongoing projects. This action was intended to help
alieviate the Government's critical need for foreign exchange
to maintain essential imports. Under this accelerated
disbursement measure, the Government was required to set
up a special counterpart fund account, equivalent to $50
million, to ensure that iocal expenditures on thé concermed
projects be promptly met as and when such expenditures are
incurred by project executing agencies. By end-December
1984, 33 per cent of this speciat account had been utilized.

The lending program to the Philippines in 1984 emphasized
quick-disbursing projects: an agricultural Inputs program loan
and two energy loans to help meet high-priority import needs
and to make more productive use of existing facilities. In addition, a supptementary joan was approved for the Afiah River
lrrigation Project. The technica! assistance program In 1984
comprised eight projects for $2.1 milllon, of which two were
to prepare projects and six were for advisory purposes, Five
were energy projects and three were agricultural.

As of the end of 1984, the Bank had approved 76 loans to
the Philippines totalling $2,111 million for 70 projects. Of
these foans, 68 amounting to $2,031.7 mililon were from OCR
and eight amounting to $79.3 million were from ADF. In addition, technical assistance totalling $14.43 million had been
provided for 66 projects, of which 27 have resulted in Bank
loans amounting to $928.14 million. Bank fending to the
Philippines has emphasized the Agriculture and Agroindustry sector, which accounts for 33.9 per cent of total
cumulative lending to the couniry, and the Energy sector,
which accounts for 28.8 per cent.

cent of the total amount of effective ioans.

4A variety of factors have adversely affected the implementation of projects in the Philippines in 1984. These include
deiays in procurement and in consultant selection, difficulties in acquiring rights-of-way, security problems in some
parts of the country, inflation, and problems associated with
compensating civil works contractors for price increases in
fuel, cement and essential raw materials. Budgetary constraints since late 1982, and successive budget revisions in
1884 under the economic adjustment program worked out
with the IMF, reduced funds available for capital expenditures
and thus slowed down the progress of project works during
the year.

Sri Lanka

Operational Strategy: The Government's current focus
is on rehabilitation, improved operations and maintenance
and more sectoraily balanced investment planning. The
Bank’s lending strategy seeks to help reverse the deterioration-of capital assets and undertake structural adjustments
needed to redirect the thrust of agricultural and énergy
development. Improving the structure of Sri Lanka’s external account and supporting the transition to a private-sector,
export-oriented economy lie at the core of the Government’s
development strategy.

Loans and Technical Assistance: in 1984, the Bank approved two loans (including one sector loan) totalling $56
million from ADF to Sri Lanka, compared with three loans
totalling $35.42 million in 1983. Local cost financing accounted for $20.04 million, or 35.8 per cent of Bank lending
to the country during the year. One project was co-financed
for $74 mitlion with IDA, the Overseas Development Authority

49of the United Kingdom, the Government of Norway and the
Government of the Netherlands.

Both 1984 loans assisted rehabilitation projects in Sri
Lanka’s major crops — rice and tree crops. The Plantation
Sector Project is intended to reverse the decline in the production and export of tea, rubber and coconut by upgrading
production and processing facilities on public-sector estates,
institutionally reforming the management of the estates and
raising producer margins. The Waiawe Irrigation improvement Project is designed to rehabilitate irrigation facilities
and improve the management of these facilities and farmer
settlements. Rice productivity and farmers’ incomes are expected to increase.

In addition, the Bank provided technical assistance to
prepare two projects: trunk roads maintenance and export
marketing of Sri Lankan graphite. Advisory and operational
technical assistance was provided to review and evaluate
the operations of Sri Lanka's urea fert!tizer plant and to support energy planning. The technical assistance approved by
the Bank totalled $595,000,

Up to the end of 1984, the Bank had provided 37 loans
amounting to $411.8 million for 31 projects. Of these, six
loans, totalling $14.13 million, were from OCR and 31 loans,
amounting to $397.62 million, were from ADF. Technical
assistance totalling $5.6 million had been approved for 37
projects, of which 18 had resulted in Bank loans amounting
to $262.3 million, The Agriculture and Agro-Industry sector
had accounted for 72.4 per cent of cumulative Bank lending
to Sd Lanka.

to resource constraints and delays in appointing project staff
and in recruiting consuitants, An unusually long rainy season
in 1983-84, which hampered access to job sites, contributed
to the slow pace of construction work in several projects.
The ethnic problem in the country also affected to some extent the supply of skilled labor and construction materials
for certain projects.

Thaifand

Operational Strategy: The Sank's lending strategy in
Thailand stresses energy, greater involvement in agricutture,
Promotion of private sector activities and provision of basic
social infrastructure facilities. In the Energy sector, priority
is focused on providing assistance for the development of
indigenous energy resources, particularly lignite and natural
gas. In agriculture, Bank assistance wili emphasize programs
and projects for achieving greater production, crop diversification and more efficient land use. In industry and
manufacturing, the Bank supports the Government’s efforts
to stimulate a more broadly based and active flow of capital
to the private sector. In basic and social infrastructure, the
Bank will continue to help provide core housing facilities for
low-income families and expand water supply systems.
Telecommunications has also been identified as among the
key sectors where Bank assistance could have a substantial developmental impact, particularly in expanding telecommunications inio the rural areas.

Loans and Technical Assistance: Bank lending to
Thatiand in 1984 totalled $195.2 million in two OCR loans for
two projects, compared with $114 million for three projects
in 1983. An energy loan, for the Mae Moh (Unit 8} Power Project, will use indigenous lignite as a fuel to help increase the
country’s generation capacity for future demands. A communications loan, forthe Rural Telecommunications Project,
will provide basic telephone services to selected rural areas
and fill an important gap in the country’s rural infrastructure,
Co-financing through a Swiss Government credit and

buyers/suppliers credit will cover part of the cost of the power
project, while co-financing from Japan’s Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund (OECF) will support the telecommunications project.

in addition, the Bank in 1984 provided technical assistance
to prepare three projects: telecommunications, land reform
and area development, and provincial towns water supply.
Advisory and operational technical assistance was also provided to: (i) help the Cold Storage Organization improve its
organizational arrangements; (ji) help formulate a flood controt strategy for Bangkok; and {iii) strengthen the operational
and planning performance of the Metropolitan Electricity
Authority. The technical assistance grants provided by the
Bank totalled $1.1 million.

The Bank has to date extended 46 loans for 43 projects
in Thailand totalling $1,508.5 million, of which 40 loans
amounting to $1,436.4 milfion were from OCR. Technical
assistance totalling $7.48 million has been provided for 31
projects, of which nine have resulted in Bank loans amounting to $380.5 million. The Energy sector has accounted for
51 per cent of total cumulative Bank lending to Thailand,
followed by the Transport and Communications sector with
18.7 per cent. ‘

Project implementation: tn Thailand, of the 46 loans approved, 22 had been fully disbursed and completed, and 24
were under administration as of the end of 1984, of which
two were awaiting loan effectivity. Disbursements totalled
$122.9 million during 1984, compared with $112.8 million in
1983. Two loans were closed and three PCRs were prepared
during the year. Cumulative disbursements of Bank loans at
the end of 1984 amounted to $728.8 million, or 57.8 per cent
of the total amount of effective loans.

Bank-assisted projects in the Energy, Transportation,
Waiter Supply and Development Banks sectors have been implemented successfully, as most of the executing agencies
involved have considerable experience in project work.
However, agricultural projects have been encountering
various difficulties, partly due to changing conditions and

The Bank tried to overcome some of these probiems by providing technical assistance to strengthen executing agencies. Complicated procedural and administrative requirements for contract approval often delayed the approval
of new contracts and the disbursement of loan funds.

Smatler South Pacific Developing
Member Countries!

Operational Strategy: Recognizing ihe unique
characteristics of the smailer South Pacific Developing
Member Countries (SPDMCs) as a group as well as Individually, the Bank has adopted a flexibte approach in Its strategy
and operating procedures to make them compatible with
each country’s particular needs and characteristics. In this
context, the Bank has emphasized providing necessary
physical and social infrastructure facilities, frequently in the
form of muitiproject loans covering sevesa! smail projects
in key sectors. Support has also been channelied through
credit lines to national development banks. In addition, the
Bank has focused on institution building through human
resource developmeni.

Loans and Technical Assistance: !n 1984, the Bank approved one loan each to Kiribati, Solomon Islands and
Western Samoa. The aggregate total of these loans was $6.55
million, Two of the loans were for Infrastructure development
and one for a DFl, The ioan to Kirlbat! will help rehabilitate
the Betio Shipyard by providing more economic ship repair
faciilties, The loan to Sotomon istands will help improve and
upgrade 90 km. of road on Guadalcanal Island. The Development Bank of Western Samoa (DBWS) received a fifth loan
to augment its foreign exchange resources to meet credit
requirements of specific development projects. Kiribati,
Vanuatu and Western Samoa received eight technical
assistance grants, of which five were advisory/operational
and three were project preparatory. Technical assistance
granted to these three countries totatied $1.55 million. The
technical assistance to OBWS — co-financed by a $50,000
grant from UNDP — will enhance the SPDMCs’ capability
for institutional and manpower development as well as project preparation.

As of the end of 1984, the Bank had approved 37 loans
amounting to $80.3 million for 34 projects in the smaller
SPDMCs. Technica! assistance totalling $8.2 million had
been provided for 61 projacts, of which 15 had resulted in
Bank loans amounting to $35.5 million. The Agriculture and
Agro-industry sector and lending through DF ls accounted for
nearly 66 per cent of cumulative Bank lending.

age of government funds for financing recurrent costs. Frequent rotation of expatriate and national project staff and
the difficulties in transferring skills to nationals, as well as
inadequate institutional and organizational arrangements,
have also impeded project implementation. SPDMCs often
have difficulty complying with the Bank's documentation procedures for procurement and disbursements. During 1984,
the Bank continued to develop and apply speciat procedures
more appropriate to the SPDMCs. Delays in communications
with the Bank Headquarters have, however, hampered the
timely resolution of project probiems. The establishment of
the South Pacific Regional Office in 1984 is expected to resuit
in significant improvements in project administration for the
SPDMCs. ‘ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES
AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Separation of Operations

IN accordance with its Articles of Agreement, the Bank’s ordinary capital resources and Special Funds resources are
held, used and commitied entirely separate from each other.
The ordinary and special operations of the Bank are shown
separately in its financial statements. Moreover, the Bank’s
ordinary resources may under no circumstances be charged
with, or used to discharge, losses or liabilities arising out
of its special operations. The Bank’s administrative expenses
are currently allocated between ordinary capital resources
and Special Funds resources on the basis of the number of
loans respectively approved from each of these resources.
Funds raised by the Bank through borrowings are included
in the Bank’s ordinary capital resources and used in its orGinary operations.

Third General Capital Increase

The third general capital increase (GCI {Il), consisting of
an additional 754,750 shares in the Bank’s authorized capital
stock, was approved by Governors’ Resolution No. 158 in
April 1983. At the 31 December 1984 exchange rate of
$0.980205 per SDR, the total amount authorized was $7,398.1
million (SDR7,547.5 million). The final date for subscribing
to GCI Ill specified in the Resolution was 31 May 1984. As
of that date, GCI Ili subscriptions had been made by only
27 member countries. In the circumstances, the Board of
Directors in June, pursuant to the provisions of the Resolution, extended the final date for subscription by six months
to 30 November 1984. By early November, however, there were
still 14 member countries which had not subscribed. in order
that GCI Ili subscriptions could be made as far as possible

nuclear and coal-based thermal plants.

by all member countries, the Board of Directors in November
extended the final date for subscription by a further six
months to 31'May 1985.

Authorized and Subscribed Capital

The Bank's authorized capital stock as of 31 December
1984 amounted to $14,475.7 million (SDR14,768.1 million). During 1884, 23 member countries subscribed to GCI Ill, for a
total amount of $3,281.92 million (SDR3,348.2 million). As of
31 December 1984, a total of 718,159 shares had been
subscribed to GCI lil, representing about 95.5 per cent of the
total share entitlements of ail member countries. The Bank’s
subscribed capital stock as of that date stood at $14,058.17
million (SDR14,342.0 million).

Valuation of Capital and Maintenance of Value

The capital stock of the Bank is defined in its Articles of
Agreement in terms of United States dollars of the weight
and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966. Since the coming into effect of the Second Amendment to the Articles of
Agreement of the Internationa! Monetary Fund (IMF) on 1
April 1978, currencies no longer have par values in terms of
gold. The implications of this change for the valuation of the
Bank’s capital stock are under examination by the Bank.
Pending a decision on this matter, the value of the Bank's
Capital stock is expressed, for purposes of the Bank’s financial statements, in terms of the SDR on the basis that each
share has the value of SDR10,000. The mutual obligations
of each member and the Bank with respect to maintenance
of value of currency holdings are also measured by the same
standard, but settlement of such obligations is being held
in abeyance. For purposes of the financial statements, the
SDR is translated into current United States dollars at the
rate computed by the IMF. As of 31 December 1984, the rate
was 0.980205 per SDR. Further information on valuation of

Special increases in Subscriptions

In 1982, the Board of Directors approved a procedure for
roultilatera! consuliation in regard to requests from individual
member countries for special increases in their capital
subscriptions. The Bank has received a number of requests
for special increases, and these are still under consideration.

Borrowings

During 1984, the Bank made 12 borrowings, all public bond
issues, amounting to the equivalent of $971.7 million, compared with the 1983 borrowing total of $978.4 million. Detaiis
of the year’s borrowings are shown in the table on page 137.

The Bank was again able to obtain relatively favorable borrowing terms and to diversify further the currencies and
markets of its borrowings. In February, it undertook its first
pound sterling borrowing and in August made a zero-coupon
borrowing in the Eurodollar market for the first time.

Over 39 per cent of the total amount borrowed during the
year was denominated in yen, consisting of three public bond
issues in Japan in April, July and November, each for ¥25
billion, and a public bond issue in February in the off-shore
market for ¥16 billion. The bonds issued in Japan in
November have a final maturity of 15 years, which is the

longest for a “Samurai” Issue in recent years.

In the German capital market the Bank made two public
bond issues, each for DM200 million, In March and
September,

For the first time, the Bank made three public bond issues
in a year in the Swiss capital market, where interest rates
remained comparatively low. Each issue was for SwFi00
million,

The pound sterling issue was for £100 million, and had a
final maturity of 25 years.

The zero-coupon bonds issued in the Eurodoltar market
have a 20-year maturity and an aggregate face value of $1
billion. The proceeds to the Bank amounted to $105 miltion.

An agreement for the Bank’s fourth public bond issue in
the Dutch capital market was signed in Amsterdam at the
time of the Seventeenth Annual Meeting of the Bank's Board
of Governors in April. The issue was for f200 miilion.

Early in the year, it was decided that the Bank’s two-year
US dollar bond program be suspended, partly on the basis
that the program had become less attractive to member country centrai banks in an era of interest rate volatility, and partly
because the two-year bonds did not currently serve the
Bank’s overall borrowing objectives,

The average maturity of the year’s borrowings weighted
by amount was 13.09 years, which had the effect of increasing the average life of outstanding borrowings to 8.31 years
at the end of 1884 from 7.72 years at the end of 1983. The
average cost, weighted by amount and average life of each
borrowing, was 9.46 per cent per annum.In May, the Bank concluded an agreement for a currency
liability swap transaction involving 15 million Kuwaiti dinars
held by the Bank for $50.8 million.

Investments

At the end of 1984, the Bank's OCR investments were
denominated in 22 currencies and amounted to the
equivalent of $2,655.5 million ($2,282.6 million at the end of
1983}, including investments in Special Reserve Fund assets.
Of the total investments, 68 per cent (64.2 per cent at the end
of 1983) was held in securities issued or guaranteed by
member governments, obligations of other multilateral
development banks and of approved government agencies
of member countries. The remainder was invested in time
deposits and certificates of deposit of banks in member
countries and the Bank for international Settlements. The
overall average yield on the Bank’s OCR investments over
the year increased from 10.35 per cent in 1983 to 10.59 per

cent in 1984, with an increase in net trading gains more than
offsetting a slight decline in current yield.

In October, the Board approved certain amendments to the
maximum maturity provisions of the investment guidelines
to give the Bank flexibility to protect the investment return
on its extended long-term borrowings against future interest
rate movements and to invest in floating rate notes without
encroaching on relevant limitations in the existing investment
guidelines.

Financial Policies

in March, the Board of Governors adopted Resolution No.
163 authorizing a gradual reduction and discontinuation of
the transfers of commissions to the special reserve. In accordance with the Resolution, the commission previously
levied on outstanding ordinary operations joans at the rate
of one per cent per annum was reduced to 0.50 per cent per
annum in 1884, and is to be further reduced to 0.25 per cent

per annum in 1985 and to zero thereafter, while no commission has been charged on new loans approved since the date
the Resolution was adopted.

Lending Rate

Based on the annual review of the lending rate in June,
the Board decided to lower the lending rate on new ordinary
operations ioans to 10.25 per cent per annum from 10.50 per
cent per annum, effective 1 July 1984.

Exchange Risk Pooling System

Of the $5,299.2 million total undisbursed balances of loans
(including loans signed but not yet effective), $4,856.2 million,
or 91.6 per cent, was covered by the Exchange Risk Pooling
System as of 31 December 1984. The amount of loans
outstanding under the System has risen from $294.9 million,
representing 8.8 per cent of total outstanding loans as of 31
December 1983, to $853.6 million, or 22.2 per cent of total
outstanding loans as of 31 December 1984.

Loan Disbursements and Repayments

Disbursements from ordinary capital resources during 1984
amounted to $702.2 million, bringing cumulative
disbursements from this source to $4,869.8 million up to the
end of 1984, Repayments during the year amounted to $189.2
million from loans held by the Bank. Cumulative loan
repayments up to the end of 1984 reached $1,010 million, consisting of $992.8 million on loans held by the Bank and $17.2
million on portions sold to participants.

income and Expenses

In 1984, gross income of the Bank was $568.6 million, up
by $90.6 million, or 18.9 per cent over the gross income in
the previous year. This increment was principally due to rises
in income from loans and investments of $42.5 million and
$46.1 million, respectively.

Total expenses amounted to $362.1 million, a rise of $63.7
million, or 21.3 per cent over the gross expenses in the
preceding year. This was due mainly to a $55.9 million increase in financial expenses.

53SPECIAL FUNDS

Progress of Asian Development Fund
Replenishments

THE third Asian Development Fund replenishment (ADF IV},
which was authorized by Governors’ Resolution No. 154 in
July 1982, is intended to finance the Bank's concessionat
fending program over the four-year period 1983-86. The total
amount authorized, at the exchange rates specified in
Resolution No. 154, was $3,214 million.

During 1984, the Bank received contribution commitments
to ADF IV from Beigium, italy and Netherlands. As a result,
ali 21 ADF IV donor countries have now contributed to the
replenishment. ln addition, New Zealand, which in 1983 had
deposited a commitment for the full amount originally envisaged for its ADF IV contribution, made an additional contribution commitment during 1984 of NZ$2 million.

Two of the ADF IV donor countries, namely, Canada and
the United States, have deposited qualified contribution commitments whereby, as permitted in the Resolution, payment
of contribution instalments is subject to budgetary appropriations. Under the ADF !V “trigger” arrangements, the release
of the second, third and fourth tranches of the unqualified
contributions for loan commitments is subject to the
availability of the first, second and remaining two tranches,
respectively, of the qualified contributions. The arrangements
envisaged that the second tranches of the unqualified contributions would be released on 1 January 1984 and the third
tranches on 1 January 1985, Canada made available its first
and second tranches in full in 1983 and 1984, respectively.
tn December 1983, the United States made available only $97
million, or 74.62 per cent, of its first tranche. As a result and
pursuant to the provisions of the Resolution, on 1 January
1984 the second tranches of the unqualified contributions
were released to the Bank for loan commitments to the extent of 74.62 per cent, and subsequently 711 of the donor countries released the full amounts of their second tranches'on
a voluntary basis.

tranche and $67 million, or 51.54 per cent, of its ADF IV second tranche. As 4 result, the 25.38 per cent balance, amount
ing to about $87 million, of the second tranches previously
withheld by eight of the donor countries became available
for loan commitments, whlle, subject to the United States
indicating its intention as regards making up the shortfall
in its second tranche, the third tranches of the unqualified
contributions were due for release in early 1985 to the extent of 514.54 per cent.t

In October 1981, the Governors adopied Resolution No.
145 extending the deadline for payment of the United States’
contribution to the first ADF replenishment {ADF il). The
Resolution provides that the Governors will fix the final date
when the United States informs the Bank of a new payment
schedule. With no further payments received from the United
States during 1984, the outstanding balance of this contribution at 31 December 1984 remained at $28.2 million.

Fourth ADF Replenishment (ADF V)

The four-year period covered by ADF IV ends on 31
December 1986. Additional ADF contributions will be needed to enable the Bank to carry on concessional lending operations in 1987 and the years beyond. Accordingly, under the
President's guidance, Bank staff in the latter part of 1984
started work on studies to determine the overail external
resource requirements of the Bank’s poorer developing
member countries during the years 1987-90, including proposais concerning the Bank’s concessional lending program
during this period and the resources necessary to meet this

program. It ls expected that negotiations on ADF V will commence in the first half of 1985,

Availability and Utilization of ADF Resources

Because of a shortage in ADF resources at the end of 1983,
about $56 million of the provision for exchange rate fluctuations had been used forioan commitments pending the partial release (74.62 per cent) of the second tranches of ADF
\V unqualified contributions on 1 January 1984, Consequently, as of 31 December 1983, there were no resources available
for loan commitments. Contributed resources becoming
available during 1984 (at the exchange rates as of 31
December 1984) consisted of $65 million for the second tranche of Canada’s ADF IV qualified contribution, $100 million
under the United States’ ADF IV qualified contribution, $41
Million for the first tranches of the ADF IV contributions
received during the year from Belgium, !taly, Netherlands and
New Zealand, and $498 million for the second tranches of
the ADF IV unqualified contributions (including the 74.62 per
cent portion released on 1 January 1984). in addition, an
amount of $18 million accrued to ADF by way of net income.
As shown in the table on page 138, over the year, total
resources, net of changes in vaiue In terms of the United
States dollar, increased by $408 million to $4,615 million,
After allowing a provision of about $222 million for exchange

 

 

tate fluctuations, net resources at 31 December 1984
amounted to $4,394 million.

Again in 1984, it was apparent that there would be a shortage of ADF resources required for the year’s planned loan
approvals. tn the circumstances, pending the partial release
(51.54 per cent) of the third tranches of the ADF IV unqualified
contributions in early 1985, Joans amounting to a total of
about $83 million were approved towards the end of the year
subject to the condition that they would not be signed until
sufficient resources became avaitable. ADF loan approvals
during 1984, including conditional approvals, totalled SDR677
million, or the equivalent of $684 million at the exchange rates
applicable at the time of loan approval. After taking account
of repayments; canceliations and exchange rate adjustments
and excluding conditional loan approvals, net loan commitments during the year, at the 31 December 1984 exchange
rates, amounted to $411 mitiion, bringing cumulative net loan
commitments at 31 December 1984 to $4,459 million. As a
result, pending the partial release of the third tranches of
the ADF unqualified contributions in early 1985,1 the provision for exchange rate fluctuations was used for loan commitments to the extent of $65 million.

 

1 The third tranches of the ADF IV unqualified contributions were released lo
the Bank to the extent of §1.54 per cent in early 1985. The total amount re
leased was $256.5 millon.Disbursements from ADF resources during 1984 amounted
to $298.3 million, bringing total cumulative disbursements
to $1,582.1 million. ADF joan repayments during the year and
cumulative repayments up to 31 December 1984 amounted
to $12.9 million and $75.6 million, respectively.

ADF Income and Expenses

ADF net income for 1984 amounted to $17.7 million, bringing accumulated net income at the end of the year to $188.2
million.

At the end of 1984, the Bank's investments of ADF
Tesources were denominated in 17 currencies and amounied
to the equivalent of $320.4 million ($398.9 million at the end
of 1983). Of the total investments, 27.5 per cent (48.2 per cent
at the end of 1983) was heid in securities issued or
guaranteed by member governments and obligations of approved government agencies of member countries. The
balance was invested in time deposits and certificates of
deposit of banks in member countries. The average yield on
ADF investments over the year was 9.58 per cent, compared
with 9.54 per cent in 1983.

The contributions from Bangladesh, Denmark, Malaysia,
New Zealand, Norway? and Pakistan are available to finance
the costs of services and facilities from the respective contributor country and all developing member countries (DMCs).
The contributions from Federal Republic of Germany, Japan,
Netherlands and United Kingdom may be used to finance the
costs of services and facilities not only from the respective
contributor country but also from all DMCs and from other
developed member countries which contribute on a similar
ly untied basis. The contributions from the Republic of Korea 
and the United States are fully untied and may be used to
finance the costs of services and facilities from all member
countries. Also, in the use of the contributions from
Bangladesh, Denmark and Norway, priority should, whenever
possible, be given to their application for projects in the least
developed member countries.

As of 31 December 1984, total contributions to TASF
amounted to the equivalent of $69.2 million, of which $61.9
million had been utilized by the Bank.

1 As of 3¢ December 1984,
2 Norway has pledged to contribute a simitar amount of NKr5,000.000 in each
of the years 1985 and 1986, subject te parliamentary appropriations.

63ADMINISTRATION

Organization

THE reorganization of the Agriculture and Rural Development
Department into the Agriculture Department and the Irrigation and Rural Development Department, referred to in the
1983 Annual Report, came into effect in January 1984. This
enabled the Bank to carry out more effectively its operations
in the major subsectors of agriculture, irrigation and rural
development. During the year, considerable attention was
given to reviewing the Bank's organizational structure, and,
in particular, a proposal was developed for the regionalization of the Bank’s operationai functions. It was, however,
decided to defer consideration of this proposal.

During the year, a review of the Bangladesh Resident Office (BRO) was undertaken to evaluate its progress and performance, particularly in respect of relieving Headquarters
of activities relating to project implementation monitoring
and loan administration. The review found that the BRO was
making good progress and contributing usefully to Bank
opérations in Bangladesh. {n July, the Bank's second field
office, the South Pacific Regional Office, began operations
in Port Vila, Vanuatu.

Internal Audit

internal auditing provides Management with independent
and objective evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness
of controls, systems and ‘procedures in the financial, accounting, administrative, data processing and other functions of
the Bank. The internal Audit Office {IAO) reports to the President and the Audit Committee of the Board.

During 1984, IAO reviewed systems and procedures
relating to financial, accounting, general administrative matters and project loan administration. {AO participated in the
development of a number of computer Systems and subsystems and aiso developed audit software for its own use
as well as for the use of the Bank's external auditors. [AO
aiso played an active role in the preparation of guidelines

on submission of financial accounts by borrowers/executing
agencies, audit of consultant's contracts and draft procedures on certain administrative and financial matters.

The resuits of audits and recommendations were conveyed
to Management and Heads of Departments and Offices concerned for information and appropriate action.

Computer and Office Automation Systems

During 1984, computer-based information and office
systems were expanded to support a wide range of Bank activities. These included loan administration, project appraisal
mission work, project processing, country socio-economic
Gata, key indicators, denomination of ADF loans in SDRs,
billing for oan service payments under the Exchange Risk
Pooling System, investment processing, electronic fund
transfers through the Society for Worldwide interbank Financial Telecommunication (S.W.1F.T.}, personnel communications plan, budget monitoring reports, preparation of Board
documents using word processors and computer output
microfiche for accounting reports and internal books of
account.

The total number of professional work-stations as of
December 1984 was 86 computer terminals and 36 terminal
printers to process over 2,000 application programs, 56 word
processors and other office systems, 28 microcomputers and
40 portable microcomputers for use by Bank staff on mission work. Microcomputers were also installed in the South
Pacific Regional Office and the Bangladesh Resident Office.
Staff authorized and trained to use these work-stations
numbered 265 for database applications, 427 for word processors and office systems, 125 for microcomputer applications and 43 for the Statistical Analysis System which inciudes modules for graphics, econometric modeling and
operations research, A wide-screen display attached to the
computer system was installed in the Office of Computer Services for Bank-wide conference use. Prototype testing of an
electronic mail application was started for internal Bank use.

has approved £87,6 milion in loans for the improvement, expansion and modernization of the water supply system in the populous
Thai capital.

Office Accommodation

Construction work on the Office Accommodation Project,
which is designed to meet office space requirements up to
1987 when the Bank is scheduled to move to its new Headquarters, was substantially completed in 1984. An additional
3,400 square meters of office space were provided in the present Headquarters building and a nearby oftice building,
greatly easing congestion in the Headquarters building and
satellite offices. Some Departments and Offices which had
become fragmented in recent years were relocated and
consolidated.

New Headquarters Building

in March, the Board approved the construction of the
Bank's new Headquarters building in Ortigas Commercial
Center. The new buiiding will accommodate about 2,400 peopie and a number of special facilities. Final sketch plans for
the building design were completed and approved in 1984.
Reports on geotechnical and geoseismic investigations were
also completed during the year.

Staff

The Bank's staff at the end of 1984 totalled 1,512 from 34
member countries. Of this number, 570 were professional
staff and 942 were supporting staff. During the year, there
were 61 professional staff appointments and 42 terminations
of appointment. Among supporting staff, 60 were appointed
and 35 resigned.

The successful recruitment efforts of 1983 were repeated
in 1984; at the end of the year, more than 98 per cent of professiona! staff positions had been filled.

The Bank’s Young Professionals Program was inaugurated
in 1984 and five Young Professionals joined the Bank during the year. Six more were selected during the fast quarter
of 1984 and are expected to report during the first half of 1985.

The annual review of staff salaries took into account
developments in the compensation of local and international
comparator organizations and trends in relevant cost-ofliving
indicators. The Board of Directors approved, effective 1
August 1984, general salary increases of 2 per cent for protessional staff and 40 per cent for supporting staff. The supporting staff salary increase supplanted an interim salary
suppiement of 20 per cent approved by the Board, effective
1 January 1984.

Budget

Internal Administrative Expenses for 1984 amounted to
$74,675,772 against the original Budget of $82,639,000,
representing 90.36 per cent utilization of the latter. The difference of $7,963,228 against the Budget is due mainly to
sayings in staff salaries, benefits and relocation, and nonuse of the general contingency. The favorable effect of
exchange rate fluctuations also contributed to the lower
utilization.

The Administrative Budget for 1985, which was approved
by the Board of Directors in December 1984, is summarized
in Appendix 1. It provides for internal Administrative Expenses in 1985 arnounting to $87,918,000, an Increase of $13.2
miliion over actual expenses in 1984, The increase is largely
attributable to: {i} fullyear effect of the past year’s staff
increase and to additional staff required for activities programmed for 1985; {ii) salary and benefits improvements
approved in 1984 and further improvements subject to consideration in .1985; (iii} increased consultant services and
business travel required for the Bank’s work in 1985; {iv} additional overheads, mainly for depreciation but also including
expendable supplies, office equipment, contractual services,
etc. for supporting the Bank’s functions; and (v) past and prospective price escalation.

Commitments for Services to Member Countries in 1984
amounted to $18,338,200, representing 83 per cent utilization
of the budget of $22,000,000 and an increase of 6 per cent
over actual commitments of $17,302,000 in 1983. Provision
is made in 1985 for new commitments amounting to
$27,000,000, representing an increase of 47 per cent over the
aciual commitments In 1984.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

2 Translation of Currencies:

Assets and liabilities are translated from their functional.

currencies to the reporting currency generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period.
Income and expense amounts are translated for each semimonthly period generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period; such practice approximates the application of average rates in effect during
the period. Translation adjustments other than those
relating to maintenance of value.of currency holdings (see

NOTE 4 — ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND
ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

Administrative expenses include an administration charge
trom Ordinary Capital Resources amounting to $34,372,000
($35,690,000 — 1983}. The charge represents an apportionment of alt administrative expenses of the Bank (other than
those appertaining directly to ordinary operations and
special operations) based on the number of loans approved
for the year,

NOTE 5 — SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

Pursuant to the provisions of Article: 19, paragraph i(i) of
the Articles of Agreement Establishing the Bank, the Board
of Governors has authorized .the setting aside. of
10% of the unimpaired ‘‘paid-in’"’ capital paid by members
pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2{a) and the convertible
currency portion paid by members pursuant to Article 6,
paragraph 2{(0).as.of 28 April 1973, to be used as part of the
Special Funds of the Bank. The capital so set.aside was
allocated and transferred from the Ordinary Capital
Resources to the Fund as Set-Aside Resources.

 

   

The capital stock of the Bank is defined in Articie 4, paragraph 1 “in terms of United States dollars of the weight and
fineness in effect on 31 January 1966” (the 1966 dollar).
Therefore, Set-Aside Resources had historically been
translated into the current United States dollar (the Bank’s
unit of account), on the basis of its par value in terms of
gold. From 1973 until 31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on
this basis was $1.20635 per 1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978,
at which time the Second Amendment to the Articles of
Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came
into effect, currencies no longer have par values in terms of
gold. Pending the Bank’s selection of appropriate successor to the 1966 dollar; the Set-Aside: Resources has
been valued for purposes of the accompanying financia!
statements in terms of the Special-Drawing Right (SDR), at
the value in current United States dollars as computed by
the IMF. As of 31 December 1984, the value of the SDR in
terms of the current United States dollar was $0.980205
($1.04695 — 1983), On this. basis, Set-Aside Resources
amounted to $46,667,000. ($49,845,000 — 1983). !f the
capital stock of the Bank as of 31 December 1984 had been
valued in terms of $12,063.50 per share, Set-Aside
Resources would have been $57,434,000.‘DELOITTE HASKINS & SELLS :

Translation of Currencies ©

Assets, iiabilities and unexpended balances in currencies

: other'than United States dollars are translated at the ap
plicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting ‘period.
As. to contributions committed, the used portions ‘havebeen transiatsd at, the. applicable exchange rates as of the

. “respective dates of use whereas’ the unused portions are
 translatéd at the applicable exchange rates as of the end of |
a reporting period: ‘Income and expense amaiurits’in curren- *

- cies other than. United States dollars. are translated for

“each semi-monthly period generally “at the applicable rates

technical assistance projects and programs totalled approximately $27,178,000 as of 31 December. 1984

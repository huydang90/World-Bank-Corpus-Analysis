MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT

he global economic crisis presented developing

Asia and the Pacific with one of the most chal
lenging years since the 1997/98 Asian financial
crisis. Reduced demand for the region’s exports from the
major industrial economies, together with muted private
consumption and investment in the region, cut growth
rates to about 5.2% in 2009, just over half the decade’s
peak of 9.5% in 2007.

Asia is leading the world’s recovery, with regional
growth expected to rebound to over 7% in 2010.
Heartening as this is, there remains an underlying
fragility to the recovery. Some economies are doing well
but others are still struggling. External demand for the
region’s goods and services, including tourism, may be
sluggish for some time until the advanced economies
fully emerge from recession. Increasing resilience to future
shocks, especially by building domestic and regional
demand, will be essential to produce the high rates of
growth needed to reduce poverty over the long term.

While economic recovery is under way, ADB has estimated that 71 million people, who could have escaped
poverty if growth rates had stayed at 2007 levels, continue living on less than $2 a day; 54 million of them have
remained living on less than $1.25 a day. High unemployment and its social impacts are likely to be felt for
several years to come, especially in poorer countries. The
crisis could have costly and long-lasting effects on human
welfare, as families with few alternative jobs and little

or no access to credit are forced to reduce the quantity

 

and quality of their food intake, withdraw children from
school, or postpone health care.

Against this backdrop, ADB shareholders agreed
in April to triple ADB’s capital base from $55 billion to
$165 billion, the biggest increase in ADB history and the
first in 15 years, giving us the resources to pursue our
mission. The capital increase enabled ADB to respond
quickly to the needs of developing member countries
by significantly scaling up our assistance, with overall
operations growing by 42% from $11.3 billion in 2008 to
$16.1 billion in 2009. Loan disbursements also reached
a record high in 2009 at $10.1 billion compared with
$8.5 billion in 2008.

As the region continues on its path to recovery, it is
critical to ensure that growth is more inclusive and environmentally sustainable. Regional integration must be
deepened to further increase the region’s resilience,
connect more of its economies to global markets, and
spread the benefits of growth. The private sector must
also be supported to help realize its key role in accelerat
ing growth and generating wider prosperity.

ADB looks forward to working
with shareholders and partners

to spread the benefits of recovery
more widely as the region emerges
from a time of crisis>

and children

About 65% of ADB investments were allocated to
infrastructure, helping promote inclusive growth by
increasing access to important services and economic
opportunities. Many of our infrastructure projects promote
regional integration, and about 35% of ADB’s total 2009
investments supported environmental sustainability.
About 81% of our total assistance in 2009 went to the five
core operational areas of infrastructure, finance, education, environment, and regional cooperation.

Alongside the global economic crisis, world leaders came together in Copenhagen in December to seek
solutions to the climate change crisis. While progress
was less than what many had hoped, leaders from both
the developed and developing world are embracing the
convergence among climate change, sustainable development, and human well-being.

ADB’s climate change and sustainable development
operations took a significant step forward. First, the ADB
Board of Directors approved two major policies: the new
Energy Policy and the Safeguards Policy Statement.
Second, we have stepped up our financial and advisory
assistance. Our clean energy program, for example, has
invested $2.8 billion over the last 2 years, investing in
renewable energy, energy efficiency, and clean technology deployment that encourage our developing member
countries to move toward low-carbon energy generation
and utilization. Third, ADB joined other multilateral
development banks in establishing the Climate Invest

ment Funds to support clean technology, climate
resilience, forest protection, and renewable energy in
low-income countries.

Our overall operations of $16.1 billion in 2009
comprised loans and grants of $14.3 billion, guarantees amounting to $397 million, $850 million for a trade
finance facilitation program, $220 million in equity
investments, and $267 million in technical assistance.
ADB also mobilized cofinancing amounting to $3.2
billion.

With the Asian Development Fund replenishment
in 2008 and the general capital increase in 2009, ADB
has a strong mandate to fully implement its long-term
strategy, Strategy 2020. The introduction of Our People
Strategy in early 2010 will ensure that we have not only
the financial but also the human resources to pursue our
important mission.

ADB looks forward to working with shareholders and
partners to spread the benefits of recovery more widely
as the region emerges from a time of crisis, with renewed
determination to tackle the causes of poverty and raise
Asia’s standards of living, especially for the poor.

s and beneficiaries included the Safeguard Policy
i 2s on involuntary resettlement,he Board of Directors is responsible for the overall

direction of the operations of the Asian Develop
ment Bank (ADB), including the approval of policies, loans, grants, and guarantees. As the representative
of ADB’s shareholders, the Board plays a vital role in overseeing ADB’s implementation of the guidance given by
its shareholders.

The Board has provided inputs both directly and
from the member capitals to make ADB a more effective
institution. As ADB expands its operations to meet the
growing demands of its developing member countries,
the Board plays an active role in overseeing institutional governance. The Board approved a number of key
measures to improve ADB’s development effectiveness,
responsiveness, and accountability.

The meetings of the Board of Directors covered a
broad range of policy, financial, and administrative issues,
as well as a wide variety of projects and programs. The
Board also endorsed new partnership strategies with
several developing member countries. Total approvals
by the Board, including loans, grants, guarantees, trade
financing facility, equity investments, and technical assistance, exceeded $16 billion. In addition, ADB mobilized
more than $3 billion in cofinancing.

The Board approved the recommendation for a 200%
general capital increase to the Board of Governors, a critical
step in securing the funds needed to implement Strategy 2020 and address the global economic crisis. The fifth
general capital increase was subsequently approved by the
Governors.

In response to the economic crisis, the Board supported several measures to assist ADB’s developing member
countries. It approved the establishment of the $3 billion
Countercyclical Support Facility as a short-term, budget
support instrument for crisis-affected members with
access to ADB’s ordinary capital resources. The Board also
approved the distribution of $400 million in additional
liquidity to ADB’s poorest members through the Asian
Development Fund (ADF).

With global trade shrinking and access to capital tightening, the Board approved an expansion of ADB’s ‘Trade
Finance Facilitation Program to $1 billion. The program
increases the financing available for trade transactions to
cushion the shock of the global downturn on developing
countries in Asia and the Pacific.

In line with the objective of Strategy 2020 to expand
private sector operations, the Board approved a new exposure management policy for nonsovereign operations. The

Annual Report 2009 9

policy, which establishes limits for nonsovereign exposure,
is designed to support the prudential expansion of private
sector operations without jeopardizing ADB’s credit
rating.

The Board also endorsed ADB’s new approach to
assisting the Pacific. Expressing concern on the impact
of global climate change on these small, developing countries, the Board underscored the need for ADB to respond
to this challenge within the special development context
of the Pacific.

The Board continued to focus on reforms in key
areas to improve ADB’s institutional effectiveness and
accountability to shareholders and beneficiaries. The
Safeguard Policy Statement was approved, updating
and superseding the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), the Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998),
and the Environment Policy (2002). The Board also
approved the new Energy Policy to meet Asia’s rapidly
growing energy needs, facilitate a transition to a lowcarbon economy, and achieve ADB’s vision of a region
free of poverty. In addition, the Board discussed the
2008 Development Effectiveness Review, a key publication
intended to drive future action and ensure greater
accountability.

With the aim of improving ADB’s internal operations,
the Board established the Human Resources Committee
to oversee and provide guidance on ADB’s human resources management.

The Board also deliberated on ADB’s annual financial
statements, its budget and borrowing program for 2010, its
Work Program and Budget Framework for 2010-2012,
and the salaries and benefits of staff. It also reviewed the
3-year rolling Work Program and Budget for 2010 of the
ADB Institute.

Country Partnership Strategies

The country partnership strategy maps out the ways
that ADB can most effectively work with its developing
member countries, given each country’s challenges and
priorities. It also enables ADB to evaluate a country’s
development performance over the strategy period.

The Board endorsed six country partnership strategies in 2009: Afghanistan (2009-2013), India (20092012), Pakistan (2009-2013), Nepal (2010-2012), Palau
(2009-2013), and Vanuatu (2010-2014). It also endorsed
an interim country partnership strategy for Solomon
Islands (2009-2011).

Other Meetings

In November, the Board and Management participated in
a 2-day retreat outside Manila, Philippines, covering two
topics: ADB’s general capital increase and the way ahead,
and ADB’s operations on climate change.

Board Group Visits and Tours

Members of the Board made two visits around the region to
get a firsthand view of ADB projects and their impacts, and
to meet with senior government officials, development partners, private sector leaders, and other stakeholders.

From 20 February to 9 March, a team visited the
People’s Republic of China and Mongolia. Another team
visited the Republic of the Marshall Islands and Palau 4-10
July. The visits strengthened ADB’s relationship with its
development partners and generated valuable feedback.

On 12 March, a Board group visited the International
Rice Research Institute south of Manila for a familiariza
tion tour.

BOARD COMMITTEES

Audit Committee

‘The committee assists the Board in its oversight of ADB’s
financial reporting and audits, including internal controls
and audits, risk management, and ADB-related anticorruption and integrity efforts.

The committee reviewed ADB’s financial statements and Management’s discussion and analysis with
the outside auditor. It also monitored the selection
process of the outside auditor and the progress toward

adoption of principles for the selection of outside
auditors, as well as the implementation of the Information Systems and Technology Strategy II and other
information technology-related activities.

The committee monitored the work of the Office
of Risk Management, including a review of ADB’s risk
management capability and progress in integrating risk
management in ADB, as well as the recommendations by
the outside auditor.

The work and findings of the Integrity Division of the
Office of the Auditor General were closely monitored by the
committee, including the implementation of recommendations to address weaknesses in internal controls and policies
identified through investigations. The committee also monitored progress toward a whistleblower protection policy.

The committee met 13 times.

Budget Review Committee

The committee discussed the President’s planning directions to prepare for the Work Program and Budget Framework, 2010-2012. It noted the development challenges
facing ADB and the new approaches, streamlined business
processes, and realigned skills mix that would be necessary to effectively meet these challenges. In August, the
committee discussed the progress of operations programs
with the operations departments; Strategy and Policy
Department; and Budget, Personnel, and Management
Systems Department. This included crisis response,
countercyclical support, private sector operations, public—
private partnerships, regional projects, cofinancing, and
projects at risk.

The committee also met with the vice-presidents on
the highlights of the draft program and framework, focusing on priority work areas, new products, and continuing
initiatives. The committee appreciated the plan under the
program and framework for ADB to pursue additional environmental initiatives, such as those that address clean and/or
renewable energyas well as climate change. Members underscored the need for ADB to strengthen collaboration with its
development partners to achieve greater development effectiveness. The committee also emphasized the importance
of the knowledge management culture and the need for the
management action plan to be implemented well.

The committee discussed the 2010 draft budget
document. It noted that the document presents a coherent picture of how ADB aims to adjust its staff and internal
resources to respond effectively to the challenges of imple-menting Strategy 2020, including support for achieving the
Millennium Development Goals, and delivering the level of
assistance envisaged by the ninth replenishment of the ADF
and the fifth general capital increase. The committee called
for continuing efforts to achieve efficiency gains, and to reassess and fine-tune the internal resource requirements in
the coming years. The committee confirmed that the 2010
draft budgets for ADB, the Independent Evaluation Department, and ADB Institute were consistent with the work
plans and appropriate for consideration by the Board. The
committee also met in November 2009 to discuss the draft
special capital budget proposal on the expansion of the
ADB headquarters building and some resident missions.
‘The committee met 11 times.

Compliance Review Committee

‘The committee is responsible for clearing the terms of reference of the Compliance Review Panel and the time frame
for conducting each compliance review authorized by the
Board, and clearing the panel’s draft reports on monitoring
the implementation of any remedial actions approved by the
Board. The committee is mandated to meet as often as it
considers necessary.

The committee met once to discuss its work plan
through 2010, the status of the Accountability Mechanism
review, and its annual report, as well as to obtain an update
from the panel on compliance review cases. The panel’s
monitoring reports are available on the panel’s website
(www.compliance.adb.org).

Development Effectiveness Committee

‘The committee discussed major evaluation reports by the
Independent Evaluation Department. These included
1 regional and 4 country assistance program evaluation

 

studies, 11 sector assistance program evaluation reports, and
4 special evaluation studies. Other department reports that
were discussed included two annual evaluation reports, one
project performance evaluation report, one impact evaluation
study, and one evaluation knowledge brief. The committee
reviewed and discussed the 2008 Development Effectiveness
Review to feed into the full Board discussion of the review.
From its findings and recommendations in 2008 on

ADB’s institutional effectiveness relative to its

 

strategies,
policies,and resources, the committee moved toward assessing ADB’s operations at the country and sector levels, and on
crosscutting themes. The discussions of country and sector

Annual Report 2009 11

assistance program evaluations were timely in informing
the preparation of new country partnerships and strategies. The committee consistently strived to recommend
ways to ensure that ADB operations would achieve development effectiveness.

The committee met 11 times.

Ethics Committee

The Board established the committee to address matters of
ethics that may arise under the Code of Conduct adopted
by the Board in September 2006. The code provisions apply
to all Board members (directors, alternate directors, and
temporary alternate directors) and to the President.

The committee is responsible for advising directors,
alternate directors, and the President when they request
guidance on actual or potential conflicts of interest or other
ethical issues concerning themselves. The committee also
considers any allegations of misconduct against directors,
alternate directors, and the President that relate to the
performance of their duties. It recommends appropriate
action to the Board.

The committee met once with the general counsel
in attendance to familiarize the new members with their
responsibilities under the Code of Conduct and related
procedures.

Human Resources Committee

In June, the Board established the committee to review,
monitor, and make recommendations to the full Board on
ADB’s human resources strategy and policies, particularly
as they pertain to staffing, compensation and benefits, and
other related issues. Members will also review any external
evaluations of ADB’s human resources strategy and policies and report their findings and recommendations to the
Board. These issues are considered vital to ADB’s ability to
recruit, train, and retain the highly qualified staff needed to
carry out its mandate under Strategy 2020.

The committee made recommendations on major
human resources initiatives such as the Our People Strategy
and the Human Resources Action Plan. The committee
also discussed other matters relevant to human resources management, including gender, integrity and ethics,
and accountability issues. The committee had separate
introductory meetings with the Staff Council and the
Professional Women’s Committee.

The committee met six times.

n 29 April, an overwhelming majority of ADB’s

67 member countries endorsed the fifth general

capital increase (GCI V), tripling ADB’s capital
base. The 200% increase is ADB’s largest and the first
since ADB increased its capital by 100% in 1994. GCI
V financially equips ADB to implement Strategy 2020,
adopted in 2008, and to pursue longer-term development priorities in the region. GCI V also allowed ADB
to substantially increase its support to countries affected
by the global economic downturn and help prevent the
reversal of hard-won gains in social and economic development and in poverty reduction in Asia and the Pacific.

IMPROVING COHERENCE
IN CORPORATE STRATEGIES
AND POLICIES

Under Strategy 2020, ADB committed to improve the
coherence of its corporate strategies and policies. In this
context, ADB reviewed existing directional documents
covering the five drivers of change and eight operational
areas. The review concluded that some existing operational
documents were not sufficiently detailed and/or current
to effectively guide implementation of Strategy 2020.
ADB completed new operational plans for private sector
and nonsovereign (see Glossary) operations, knowledge
management, and agriculture (focusing on sustainable
food security), and began working on new operational
plans for education, transport, and finance.

2009 ENERGY POLICY

In June, ADB approved a new Energy Policy, aligning its
energy operations with Strategy 2020. The policy aims to
help ADB’s developing member countries provide reliable, adequate, and affordable energy for inclusive growth

The Safeguard Policy Statement
incorporates international good
practice and harmonizes with the
policies of other multilateral
development banks

Annual Report 2009 We

ina manner that encourages social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Implementation centers on three
key pillars: promoting energy efficiency and renewable
energy; maximizing access to energy forall; and promoting
energy sector reform, capacity building, and governance.

SAFEGUARD POLICY STATEMENT

On 20 July, ADB approved the Safeguard Policy Statement
(SPS) governing environmental and social safeguards for
ADB operations. The SPS supersedes three previous safeguard policies on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples, uniting them in a single
document that will enhance consistency and coherence.
The policy defines common objectives and policy principles, and outlines a policy delivery process. It also provides
specific requirements for borrowers and clients as they
address the environmental and social impacts and risks of
ADB-supported projects.

The SPS incorporates international good practice
and harmonizes with the policies of other multilateral
development banks. It includes appropriate requirements
for different lending modalities and recently developed
financial instruments, and further strengthens requirements for safeguard monitoring and supervision. The SPS
increases emphasis on developing capacity to manage
environmental and social impacts and risks. It also introduces provisions to strengthen and use country safeguard
systems for ADB projects, subject to ADB’s assessments
of equivalence and acceptability.

REVIEW OF EXPOSURE LIMITS ON
NONSOVEREIGN OPERATIONS

In October, ADB approved an exposure management
policy for nonsovereign operations (NSO), establishing a
medium-term overall limit for nonsovereign exposure that
equals about 15% of projected total operations and gradually phases in NSO growth. It also limited to $2.1 billion the
maximum nonsovereign exposure of any single country.
This limit represents about 20% of the proposed NSO
limit in 2014, or about 60% of notional NSO capital. The
new policy ensures that the growth of NSO exposure
envisaged under Strategy 2020 will not exceed ADB’s riskbearing capacity.

MAlAdSAO ADALVALS GNV ADITOd |POLICY AND STRATEGY OVERVIEW |

16 Asian Development Bank

The country limit will vary according to the country’s
credit rating. To ensure equitable access for all countries,
the country limit cannot exceed 10% of gross domestic product, less sovereign (see Glossary) exposure. A minimum
country allocation of $25 million will enable meaningful

private sector interventions in smaller countries.

ADB also established prudential limits for industry,
groups, single obligors, and counterparties, and introduced a definition of exposure that concurs with that
already established by ADB’s capital adequacy framework.

 

The Global Economic Crisis: ADB’s Response

with one of its most difficult challenges in recent

times. The crisis spread to Asia mainly through collapsing demand for regional exports in major global markets. Because a large portion of regional trade involves parts
and components supporting supply chains, imports also
suffered steep declines. Weakening regional consumption
and investments further compounded these problems, substantially reducing growth rates (5.2% forecasted in 2009)
from the decade's peak of 9.5% in 2007. ADB estimates
that the regional decline in economic growth projected for
2009 will cause 54 million and 71 million people to remain
below the poverty threshold (at $1.25 and $2.00 a day, respectively), compared with a “without crisis” scenario under
which the high growth rate of 2007 would have continued.
This is a major setback to the fight against poverty.

Mobilizing Additional Resources to Support
Emerging Development Needs

The timely completion of the fifth general capital increase
and successful ninth replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (ADF X) in May 2008 enabled ADB to respond
quickly to the needs of developing member countries affected by the crisis.

By 31 December, ADB had allocated $8.8 billion in
total crisis support for 43 projects, of which $7.0 billion (80%) was delivered in 2009. By source of fund,
ordinary capital resources (OCR) provided $7.6 billion (87%) and ADF resources provided the remaining
$1.2 billion (13%). By modality, program loans accounted
for 40.1%, the Countercyclical Support Facility (CSF) provided about 28.5%, nonsovereign operations accounted
for 20.1%, and 11.3% came from sovereign project loans
and grants. Crisis assistance concentrated primarily on quickdisbursing budget support, and supporting public and private projects that generate employment and increase business confidence. As of 31 December, total crisis-related disbursement amounted to more than $4 billion.

Countercyclical Support Facility

In June, ADB established the $3 billion CSF. The new, timerestricted budget support instrument will support developing member countries eligible for borrowing OCR and
help middle-income developing member countries sustain
critical expenditures. Designed as a short-term lending instrument, the CSF complements conventional program
loans that support longer-term structural reforms. The CSF
adopted access criteria to determine eligibility, and needs

By 31 December, ADB had approved $2.5 billion in assistance to five countries (Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kazakhstan,
the Philippines, and Viet Nam). Consistent with the quick-disbursing nature of the facility, $2 billion (80% of the amount
approved) had been fully disbursed by the end of 2009.

Additional Asian Development Fund
Commitment Authority

Also in June, ADB approved an additional $400 million
ADF commitment authority to help the most fiscally
stretched ADF-only countries, which have difficulty
accessing nonconcessional resources. Funds were
allocated according to the performance-based allocation
formula, increasing the total ADF allocation for 20092010 to $5.76 billion. In addition, ADF-eligible borrowers
were allowed to front-load up to 100% of their biennial
allocation. Armenia, Georgia, Mongolia, and Papua New
Guinea sought and received approval for front-loading
beyond their maximum allowable annual utilization.

Cofinancing

ADB also committed to increase project cofinancing. The
total of direct value-added cofinancing (see Glossary)
increased from $1.1 billion in 2008 to $3.2 billion in 2009.
Collaborative cofinancing with the World Bank accounted for
most of the increase. To establish stable sources of funding
alongside its own investments, ADB also increased its efforts
toward more programmatic cofinancing arrangements
with its financing partners (the People’s Republic of China,
Islamic Development Bank, Japan, and the Republic of Korea).

Supporting Private Sector Recovery

Strategy 2020 emphasizes the importance of the private
sector as a key driver of change, a role that increased as the
region worked to overcome the economic crisis and impel
the next stage of growth. ADB’s crisis-related assistance
to the private sector aims to rebuild business confidence
by providing incentives for private investment and facilitating trade financing. The crisis dramatically reduced the
amount of financing available to companies for trade. This
shortage hit developing nations particularly hard as major
international banks worked to rebuild capital and reduce
risk. Access to trade finance has been vital in cushioning
the shock of the global crisis on international trade. On
31 March, ADB expanded its Trade Finance Facilitation
Program (TFFP), increasing its overall exposure limit to
$1 billion from an initial $150 million. By the end of
December, total TFFP exposure reached over $700 million,
exceeding the $500 million target set for 2009. This TFFP

Annual Report 2009

exposure supported $1.9 billion in trade, most of which
occurred within the region. Much of ADB’s TFFP outstanding portfolio is in Asia’s most challenging markets, including Bangladesh and Pakistan. The program continues to
expand aggressively throughout developing Asia.

Strengthening Regional Cooperation, Policy
Advice, and Knowledge Sharing

ADB also intensified its policy advice to developing member countries through technical assistance grants. Country
economic analysis and forecast for Asia and the Pacific were
spearheaded by the Asian Development Outlook (ADO) in
March and the ADO update in September. To generate
appropriate policy responses to the crisis, ADB and the
ADB Institute also facilitated expert discussions and ideas
exchange among developing member countries, organizing about 20 events on the global economic crisis (often in
association with other development partners) throughout
2009.

In March, ADB convened the first South Asian Forum on
the Impact of the Global Economic and Financial Crisis. During the 2-day forum in Manila, public and private sector representatives from seven South Asian countries (Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka)
shared cross-country experiences on the impacts of the
crisis, and on the ongoing and planned measures to
preserve financial stability, stimulate growth, and ensure
social protection in their respective economies. In
September, a high-level conference on the impact of the
crisis on poverty and sustainable development was held in
Ha Noi, Viet Nam. In early October, an international conference co-organized by ADB on financial policy responses to
the crisis, held in Seoul, Republic of Korea, drew lessons
from the crisis and identified areas to further safeguard
regional financial systems.

ADB estimates the regional
decline in economic growth in
2009 will cause 54 million and 71
million people to remain below
the poverty threshold (at $1.25
and $2.00 a day, respectively),
compared with a “without crisis”
scenario. This is a major setback
to the fight against poverty

DELIVERING AN EFFECTIVE
ORGANIZATION

Through actions including stronger, more independent evaluation of its programs,
influential research underscoring its role as a regional knowledge leader, and better
management of human resources, ADB strove to increase the effectiveness of its
Selo programs. It bolstered its institutional relevance and performance
through j a lasting commitment to the principles of good. governance and sound
business practices in all operations.

 

 

[oe

terOVERVIEW

ADB worked systematically to make its assistance more
efficient, deliver better results, and make the best use
of resources under the fifth general capital increase. Key
activities for executing Strategy 2020 included initiatives
to improve how ADB manages and accounts for its money,
manages staff, and progresses toward building an effective
learning organization that is able to excel at leveraging and
sharing its expertise with development partners.

Rigorous assessment of strategies, policies, procedures, and operations by the renamed Independent
Evaluation Department (IED) continued during the
year. Monitoring of IED’s recommendations for deeper
management accountability and dissemination of lessons
learned within ADB and beyond were important themes
throughout 2009. ADB’s research departments—Asian
Development Bank Institute (ADB Institute), Economics and Research Department, Office of Regional and
Economic Integration, and Regional and Sustainable
Development Department—continued to produce key
analyses and information, such as the seminal piece of
work on a “seamless Asia” which has influenced policy
makers across ADB’s member countries.

The year also saw ADB improve its human resources management to prepare for the increase in workforce
required to implement Strategy 2020, and streamline
business processes to consolidate partnerships with
developing member countries and improve loan delivery.
Credit risk management was improved to better position
nonsovereign operations for the private sector’s increased
role in ADB operations over the coming decade.

ENSURING ADB MAKES
A REAL DIFFERENCE

Managing for Development Results

In September, ADB Management approved a new action
plan to institutionalize the managing for development results
(MfDR) approach, support developing member countries’
capacity to follow its methods, and build partnerships with
other organizations on global and regional MfDR initiatives.

During the year, ADB further refined its focus on
results. This was achieved through regular performance
monitoring and action planning within the corporate

Annual Report 2009 Vg

results framework, the second development effectiveness
review (covering ADB’s performance in 2008), and the use
of better tools for country operations planning, monitoring, and reporting, helped by user-friendly management
information systems.

ADB also implemented recommendations of the
2007 and 2008 development effectiveness reviews.
ADB incorporated feedback from shareholders into the
results framework and streamlined sector-wide outputs,
and established common definitions for all performance
indicators across departments. ADB added more quantitative data alongside qualitative country assessments in
its Development Effectiveness Brief series. By using selected
indicators from its results framework, ADB brought the
briefs in line with the development effectiveness review.
ADB also established a working group to identify better
steps to incorporating gender issues in all its operations.

ADB helped increase results management capacity in
its developing member countries by promoting learning and
knowledge exchange through the Asia-Pacific Community of
Practice on Managing for Development Results. The community of practice fosters exchange between public managers,
organizations, executing agencies, and practitioners. As the
secretariat for the community of practice, ADB published
Moving from Concept to Action on MfDR good practices.

ADB also funded initiatives to promote MfDR in planning and implementing programs in developing member
countries. ADB supported the Asia Regional Forum on
Mainstreaming Managing for Development Results,
held in Colombo in October. The forum gave developing
member countries an opportunity to discuss MfDR experiences and current obstacles, especially in results-based
budgeting. ADB participated in global and regional initiatives such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development—Development Assistance Committee
Global Partnership on Managing for Development Results
and the Multilateral Development Bank Working Group on
Managing for Development Results.

Progress on Aid Effectiveness Agenda

ADB made significant progress toward achieving most targets
of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Concentrating
on the need to keep policies and programs in step with
those of developing member countries, ADB met targets for
aligning aid flows with national priorities, coordinating technical support, and using country public financial management
systems. It is also on track to meet targets on the use of country
procurement systems for national competitive bidding, on
reducing the number of parallel project implementation structures, and for enhancing aid predictability. ADB will need

to increase efforts to meet targets on using program-based
approaches and coordinating donor missions, and to undertake joint country analytical work to meet the Paris Declaration targets by their 2010 deadline. In March, ADB launched
a joint donor initiative called the Capacity Development
Facility for Development Effectiveness to help governments prepare localized action plans on the declaration.

Ensuring Accountability and Compliance

The ADB Accountability Mechanism provides an independent forum for people adversely affected by ADB
2008 Development Effectiveness Review

To ensure that it is meeting the goals laid out under its long-term strategy for 2008-2020 (Strategy 2020), ADB adopted a
corporate results framework that measures its contribution to development in Asia and the Pacific, and its performance as an
organization. ADB reports progress on the results framework annually through the Development Effectiveness Review. The
2008 Development Effectiveness Review is ADB's second corporate performance report.

The 2008 review confirms that, compared with its 2007 performance, ADB is improving its overall development effectiveness, with the majority of performance indicators on track to meet targets. It also highlights areas that need strengthening,
such as project performance reporting, knowledge creation and sharing, cofinancing, gender mainstreaming through operations, and gender equality within the organization. In response to the review findings, ADB will implement a number of time
bound remedial actions.

of noncompliance with ADB’s operational policies and
procedures, and achieve resolution. The mechanism
has two related phases: consultation conducted by the
special project facilitator, and review led by the independent Compliance Review Panel. People who believe that
they are, or may be, adversely affected by ADB-assisted
operations may bring a complaint to the special project
facilitator to seek a resolution of the problem through
consultation and facilitation. In certain circumstances,
if the affected persons believe the alleged harm was the
result of ADB’s failure to comply with operational policies and procedures, they may ask that the panel review
the allegation of noncompliance. The mechanism is also
designed to contribute to ADB’s development effectiveness and help improve project quality.

The Office of the Special Project Facilitator (OSPF)
reviewed 13 new complaints in 2009. Four were found
to meet OSPF’s eligibility criteria, and their handling
received priority attention. OSPF conducted studies and
disseminated information on project-specific grievance
mechanisms, including a book on handling complaints.
‘The Compliance Review Panel received one request for
a review filed in relation to the Fuzhou Environmental
Improvement Project in the People’s Republic of China.
‘The review was ongoing as of 31 December 2009. The
panel also continued to monitor Board-approved remedial actions for the Chashma Right Bank Irrigation Project
Stage III in Pakistan and the Southern Transport Development Project in Sri Lanka.

Throughout the year, OSPF and the Office of the
Compliance Review Panel (OCRP) continued their
outreach activities, including disseminating information about the Accountability Mechanism, by updating,
translating, and distributing information brochures; and
conducting orientation and training sessions. To aid
cooperation with independent accountability mechanisms of international finance institutions, OCRP established a global community of practice, which joins other
international financial institutions and a number of bilateral agencies as part of a virtual network.

Independent Evaluation for
Development Effectiveness

Although the Operations Evaluation Department
became operationally independent in January 2004 and

Annual Report 2009 21

began reporting directly to ADB’s Board of Directors, a
review in 2008—which included extensive consultation
with members of ADB’s staff, Management and Board
of Directors, and the Evaluation Cooperation Group
of other multilateral development banks—concluded
that its evaluation functions could be made more effective. Accordingly, on 1 January 2009, it became the IED.
This and other changes effectively minimized the role
of Management in selecting, appointing, and evaluating the performance of IED’s director general, thus
ensuring operational autonomy and protection from
outside influence. The changes also provided a greater
degree of autonomy in the recruitment of department
staff, and more independence in budget formulation and
flexibility in resource use. The Board’s updated policy
on IED likewise requires it to follow internationally
accepted principles to ensure that its evaluations are
impartial, independent, credible, timely, and useful, and
that it works closely with all stakeholders.

From an accountability perspective, the purpose of
ss whether ADB is doing
the right things, allocating and using resources properly,

independent evaluation is to ass

  

and realizing intended outcomes. One measure of this is
the project and program success rate. The long-term trend
in success rates of ADB projects and programs by the year
of approval is shown in the figure in Appendix 15. The
tables in the same appendix show project and program
success rates by country and sector.

The IED also derives lessons and best practices to
promote the sustainability and development impact of
ADB assistance; recommends measures for the design
of future policies, strategies, practices, and procedures;
and assesses the development effectiveness of resources.
Follow-up assessments of recommendations are carried
out to sustain the benefits of ADB’s operations.

The department also coordinates evaluation practices
and activities with other multilateral development banks
through the Evaluation Cooperation Group, and reviews
new operations to ensure that lessons learned and appropriate monitoring and evaluation frameworks have been
incorporated.

A more rigorous system to monitor the cumulative progress of actions taken on the department’s
recommendations became operational in 2009. The
management action record system serves as an accountability mechanism to monitor how the department’s
recommendations are acted upon. The system allows

assessment of how ADB Management incorporates
the findings and recommendations of evaluations
into its decision making. The system provides wide
electronic access to evaluation recommendations. It
also promotes ADB ownership and allows systematic tracking to help validate actions taken. To ensure
improved development effectiveness, IED highlighted the importance of monitoring outcomes,
particularly after loans are closed.

IED’s work program is rooted in Strategy 2020 and
the ninth replenishment of the Asian Development Fund
(ADF). It takes into account ADB’s changing operating
environment and promotes self-evaluation by operational departments and developing member countries. IED
increasingly turned to providing input into ADB policies
and programs to ensure greater consistency with overall
strategy. Both higher-level evaluations ona regional scale

Helping Lives to Flow

Independent evaluation allowed the success of
a water and sanitation project in Pakistan to be
gauged, while highlighting where there was
room for improvement

DB-funded water and sanitation projects in
Arcee Punjab province brought the welcome

benefit of freedom from an arduous task for one
schoolgirl. “| do not have to suffer from back pain and
headache from fetching water from outside. | can now go
to high school and think about my future,” she says.

The $38 million Punjab Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Project, completed in 2003, improved conditions
for about 900,000 people in 335 communities; and the
$50 million Punjab Community Water Supply and Sanitation
Project, completed in 2007, brought the same kind of
benefits to about 2.3 million people in 788 communities.

An assessment by ADB’s Independent Evaluation Department showed the sense of liberation felt by the girl in
Rawalpindi and other districts, and improved the lives of the
3.2 million people given access to clean water.

The department's study measured the impact of
the projects on health, school attendance, labor force
participation, and the hours worked. Comparisons with

  

< - > a

almost identical households in a similar location outside
the project area enabled the scale of improvements to be
estimated and attributed more accurately.

The study compared a representative sample of 1,301
beneficiary households selected randomly from 115 communities (10% of communities in the project areas) with a
comparison group of 1,301 randomly selected households
from 115 communities that were not part of the project.
These two groups were well matched in terms of all key
socioeconomic attributes except access to a potable water
supply.

It was found that ADB assistance greatly improved
access to drinking water and particularly benefited women
and girls, freed from the time and difficulty of carrying
water from far-flung places. “My girls do not have to walk
long distances to fetch water because it is available within
the house. | am happy with water quality and availability,”
said a woman from Faisalabad district.

The time and effort saved has resulted in 8.2% more
girls (14-17 years old) attending high school, and significantly reduced the school dropout rate in the project
areas, even among the poorest.

Better access to safe water supply did not, however,
improve women’s participation in the workforce, nor
did it significantly reduce the incidence and intensity of
diarrhea. Rural water supply and sanitation projects focus
more on improving water access to the households, and
less on managing wastewater and solid waste.

The study concluded that the next step in project
design to improve the effectiveness of ADB investments
is to create synergies between water supply and the safe
disposal of waste water.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions and ADB Operations in the Energy Sector

sa significant proportion of greenhouse gas (GHG)
Aversion originates from the energy sector,

energy operations are critical to controlling pollution. At the same time, because of the vital role that
energy availability plays in economic development, ADB
assigns a high priority to investments in this sector. To
address global concerns that GHG emissions accelerate
climate change, both ADB's Strategy 2020 and its 2009
Energy Policy require that ADB assist developing member
countries to put their economies on a low-carbon growth
path. In particular, ADB is to help developing member
countries improve energy efficiency, expand the use of
energy derived from clean sources, reduce fugitive GHG
emissions such as methane from landfills, modernize
public transport systems, and arrest deforestation.

In fulfilling this mandate, the Independent Evaluation
Department recently reviewed ADB's energy sector
assistance to Bangladesh, the People’s Republic of China,
India, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. These
countries account for 80% of ADB assistance to the
energy sector. Comparing the periods 2001-2005 and
2006-2008, the review found that annual lending to clean
energy projects increased fourfold to about $670 million,

operational departments continued. IED also helped
developing member countries build capacity to evaluate and monitor investments. In the People’s Republic
of China, IED and the World Bank’s Evaluation Group
jointly provided training in this regard.

IED completed country assistance program evaluations for Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, and Viet Nam.
‘The department conducted several higher-level special
evaluation studies relating to public-private partnerships, rural roads, gender and development, and justice
reforms in selected developing countries. It evaluated ADB assistance to public sector reform in Pacific
island countries. IED used quasi-experimental methods
to assess the development impact of ADB operations
(Helping Lives to Flow, p. 22).

Besides providing timely feedback on operational
documents, IED also continued to carry out real-time
evaluation. It examined the ongoing Emergency Rehabilitation of Calamity Damage Project in Viet Nam, as well as
ADB’s response to the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.
In sum, IED continued to perform credible, timely, and
strategic higher-level evaluations, and to encourage and
validate self-evaluation by operational departments and
developing member countries.

the share of clean energy projects in total energy sector
assistance increased from 26% to 43%, and energy sector
assistance to the private sector (without government
guarantee) increased twelvefold. The review also
found ADB has increasingly emphasized GHG-efficient
investments in its energy sector portfolio.

The review found that in promoting investment in energy efficiency, ADB focuses more on energy sector entities rather than broad reforms of the entire sector. Scope
exists for ADB to assist developing member countries to
cut the high cost of energy from renewable sources. This
can be done by helping developing member countries introduce more appropriate technologies, encouraging local production of equipment, and exploiting economies
of scale. Finally, the review recommended that ADB promote GHG-efficient investments by helping developing
member countries reduce the incremental cost of cleancoal technologies, encourage the use of appropriate and
affordable renewable energy technologies, aggressively
pursue methane capture projects, focus on projects that
increase energy efficiency in the industry sector, and assess the GHG implications of proposed energy-sector investments.

STRENGTHENING LEARNING

Learning from Independent Evaluation

IED disseminated its findings and lessons learned on
its website and through knowledge products such as
Learning Curves, Evaluation Alerts, Evaluation Presentations, and Evaluation News. IED also introduced Evaluation Knowledge Brief, which analyzes specific areas
of ADB operations with respect to issues that interest
both the developing member countries and the donor
community. The first brief analyzed the interrelationship between economic growth, ADB operations in the
energy sector, the global problem of greenhouse gas emissions, and Strategy 2020’s emphasis on environmentally
sustainable growth (Greenhouse Gas Emissions and ADB
Operations in the Energy Sector, p. 23). Such department
initiatives provide timely information on matters of broad
concern to development stakeholders and help decision
makers take action.

In February, IED’s internal structure was reconfigured
to align with ADB’s overall organizational structure. IED
also established a strategy, quality, and knowledge unit

within the office of the director general to provide quality
assurance services, improve and refine evaluation methodologies, and manage knowledge products. Finally, the
departmentbegandevelopingalong-termstrategyto2020
to ensure appropriate responses to the region’s development requirements that are likely to emerge.

Generating and Sharing Knowledge

ADB’s Strategy 2020 underlined the importance of knowledge solutions as a driver of change. On 31 July, President Kuroda approved a comprehensive plan of action
to ensure that the organization’s knowledge products
and services remains of the highest quality, continues
to expand, and is of practical use in developing member
countries. The plan is organized into four clusters. The
first focuses on adding value to ADB’s operations in developing member countries, and the other three deal with
how to do it. The plan is designed to sharpen the knowledge focus in ADB’s operations, empower communities
of practice, strengthen external knowledge partnerships,
and enhance staff learning and skills.

Several parts of the plan were launched in 2009, building
on work started in the previous year. Measures for implementing others were incorporated into ADB’s Work Program
and Budget Framework (2010-2012). In November, the
Regional and Sustainable Development Department began
to formulate a knowledge management results framework
to monitor and report on implementation.

‘Toward the end of the year, ADB conducted its annual Most Admired Knowledge Enterprise survey to gauge
staff perception of how effective ADB was in managing knowledge in 2009. Staff participation increased by

155% over 2008, and the survey confirmed improved
organizational knowledge capacities, especially in developing and delivering client knowledge-based projects
and services and in creating a knowledge-sharing environment throughout the organization.

In response to requests from policy makers, ADB
Institute evaluated the impacts of the global crisis
on Asia. The research recommended macroprudential surveillance and regulation of the finance sector;
deepening of regional bond markets, including promotion of rating agencies, and harmonization of issuing
requirements, regulations, and tax regimes; a regime
for monetary policy that takes account of asset price
movements to avoid development of bubbles; greater liberalization of regional trade (including services)
and investment; development of an Asian infrastructure investment fund; stronger social safety nets and
national pension systems; and policies and strategies
to achieve low-carbon growth more cost-effectively and
to lower trade barriers for green technology transfer.

ADB Institute’s distinguished-speaker seminar series
encouraged debate and knowledge sharing. At nine presentations, internationally known experts spoke on policy
and development issues, including reform of international
economic institutions, post-crisis issues facing Asia and the
Pacific, and United States trade policy toward Asia.

Sharpening the Knowledge Focus in
ADB Operations

ADB leveraged its comparative advantages—expertise in
identifying trends in the region, capacity for interdisciplinary and integrated approaches, and its ability to blend

stance on critical challenges in Asia and the Pacific. These
products, designed to help key regional stakeholders make
informed decisions and take positive action, received
much coverage in the global media, reinforcing ADB’s
image as a knowledge source. (See Appendix 14 for a list
of ADB’s knowledge products.)

Asian Development Outlook 2009: Rebalancing Asia’s Growth
discussed the mix of actions that were undertaken in Asian
economies to mitigate the effects of the global economic crisis and recommended measures to rebalance Asia’s
growth. Asian Development Outlook 2009 Update concentrated
on broadening the scope and structure of Asia’s openness
to trade, capital flows, and movement of workers.

ADB Institute’s conference with the Brookings Institution discussed the principles of financial regulation,
financial development and regulation in emerging markets, macroeconomic frameworks to support financial
stability and inclusion, and cross-border regulation of
capital flows. The Regional and Sustainable Development Department and ADB Institute organized a conference on The Impact of the Global Economic Slowdown
on Poverty and Sustainable Development in Asia and
the Pacific in Ha Noi, Viet Nam. The conference also
served as the 3rd China-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Forum on Social Development and
Poverty Reduction and the 4th ASEAN+3 High-Level
Seminar on Poverty Reduction.

2009 Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific—besides
featuring the latest available economic, financial, social,
and environmental indicators for the region—deliberated on the impact of the crisis on small and medium-sized
enterprises, and on how they might foster greater dynamism once the crisis has played out. /nfrastructure for a
Seamless Asia projected an annual infrastructure investment of $750 billion in the region during 2010-2020 and
proposed an infrastructure fund to mobilize Asian and
international funds.

Economics of Climate Change in Southeast Asia: A Regional Review demonstrated to stakeholders, including policy
makers and the private sector, that a wide range of adaptation measures are already being applied, and that the
region has great potential to contribute to the global
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Annual Report 2009 = 25

‘To further monitor developments in the region, Asia
Capital Markets Monitor was launched. It is an annual report
that reviews recent developments in Asia’s stock, bond,
and currency markets, along with their outlook, risks, and
policy implications. Asia Bond Monitor was launched as a
quarterly publication to provide more timely analysis o
local-currency-denominated bond markets in the wake o
the global financial crisis. The semiannual Asia Economic
Monitor was published in July and December.

At the country level, the knowledge departments
produced diagnostics to mainstream in-depth analysis 0:

Sanitation in India—Progress, Differentials, Correlates, and
Challenges. The statistical database system, ADB’s searchable database for storing annually updated macroeconomic
and social data from national statistical offices and central
banks, continued to support ADB’s operations. The
Economics and Research Department conducted a workshop on Challenges in Managing National Statisti
 

cal Systems to build the capacity of national statistical
offices and planning and finance ministries.

At the project level, successful practices were documented and disseminated through briefs and good-practice
papers. Many of these were founded on IED’s studies as well as self-evaluations. The Knowledge Showcase
series—which presents innovative ideas and serves to
foster discussion and research, and perhaps even encourages replication—covered disaster management, public
accountability, and more. The readership increased both
inside and outside ADB.

Knowledge Solutions—quick reference guides to tools,
methods, and approaches that propel development and
enhance its effects—attracted more attention. Topics
on strategy development, management techniques,
collaboration mechanisms, knowledge sharing and learning, and knowledge capture and storage were covered in
43 issues added to the series. ADB Economics Working Paper
Series, ADB Regional Economic Integration Working Paper
Series, ADBI Working PaperSeries, ADB Briefs, and Asian
Development Review—the forums for ongoing and recently completed research and policy studies by ADB and
ADB Institute staff members, consultants, and resource
persons—continued to stimulate discussion on key
economic and development issues in the region.

Empowering the Communities of Practice

Communities of practice (CoPs)help generate and share
knowledge, ultimately to the benefit of ADB’s clients.
‘They keep know-how in sectoral and thematic domains
alive by continuously sharing what they know, building on
it, and adapting knowledge to specific applications.

ADB hosted CoPs on topics such as agriculture and
food security, education, energy, environment, finance,
gender, governance, health, regional cooperation, transport, urban development, and water. The year saw a surge
in support to CoPs, beginning with the first-ever survey
to gauge factors contributing to their performance. Next
came interventions to fill gaps and boost effectiveness—
including significant budget increases, streamlined
guidelines on sector and thematic reporting, a brainstorming session toward a forum on learning, and an
inaugural year-end gathering to give in-house CoPs a
chance to highlight their accomplishments and exchange
lessons.

CoPs contributed to key ADB documents, among
them the Operational Plan for Sustainable Food Security and Sustainable Transport Initiatives and Action
Plan. They also undertook numerous regional studies
in aid of project design and implementation, including
rapid gender assessments in four developing member
countries, market analysis and project identification for
nonsovereign lendingin urban infrastructure in the People’s
Republic of China, and an assessment of the community
impact of environmental infrastructure in Pakistan.

Outreach to stakeholders also gained firmer footing,
with CoP members providing advice on projects managed
by their peers (e.g., the Viet Nam Mong Duong 2 Power
Plant), and CoPs as a group forging stronger links with
development partners (e.g., the Clean Air Initiative for
Asian Cities). Finally, the CoPs broadened ADB’s knowledge base by producing a long list of knowledge products,
including good-practice studies on education, tool kits
for urban transport development, and e-newsletters and

video documentaries on water.

Strengthening External
Knowledge Partnerships

ADB shares insights from its development practices and
benefits from knowledge generated by others. Knowledge hubs are important conduits.

The number of ADB-assisted water-related hubs grew
from 13 to 17. They offered innovative solutions in river
basin management, climate change adaptation, water quality
management, and irrigation service reforms. Seven regional
knowledge hubs established in 2006 on clean energy; climate
change; public finance; public-private partnerships; reducing, reusing, and recycling; sustainable development; and
regional trade and investment cooperation stood tocomplete
their deliverables in the first half of 2010.

Work on guidelines to design knowledge partnerships for collaborative advantage was initiated to
strengthen existing partnerships and develop new ones.

Jountry diagnostics were developed in partnership
with the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development and Department of Foreign Affairs, the
International Labour Organization, the Islamic Development Bank, the United Nations (UN) Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, and relevant
government agencies. The Workshop on Challenges in
Managing National Statistical Systems was held in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
UN. ADB signeda milestone agreement with the National
University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public
Policy to exchange information, knowledge, and staff.

ADB Institute served as a forum for Asian think tanks
to forge recommendations for East Asian countries participating in the G20 London Summit. The forum called for
collective action in East Asia and encouraged the US and
Europe to improve their fiscal and financial health.

About 1,500 people, two-thirds of whom were government officials from developing member countries, attended
31 ADB Institute capacity-building events. The events tackled public-private partnerships in infrastructure, water
resource management, climate change adaptation, capital
market reforms, trade facilitation, eco-industrial clusters, the
Millennium Development Goals, and competition policies.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development and ADB Institute’s 10th Roundtable on
Capital Market Reform in Asia debated the causes of the
global financial crisis, and the impact on and implications
for capital market development in Asia.

Enhancing Staff Learning and Skills

The ability of staff to learn is a precondition to the
success of Strategy 2020. Beyond updating technical
and professional skills, staff must also acquire andmaster methods and techniques for knowledge management and learning.

Several needs-based learning programs were conducted.
Among many others, these included economic analysis for
investment-based lending, climate change and financing for
ADB operations, and Islamic finance. The customized nature
of the courses gave staff members new skills, from simulating climate change and its economic impacts to performing
econometric analysis using state-of-the-art software.

The Regional and Sustainable Development Department developed six courses, dubbed Learning for Change
Primers, to help raise in-house capacity to leverage knowledge with information technology, grasp the essentials of
successful communities of practice, understand knowledge
management and learning essentials, manage knowledge
at work, build a learning organization, and improve the
design of knowledge partnerships.

Efforts were made to capture, store, and share the
knowledge of past and present staff members. Throughout the year, they explored ways to marry ADB’s narrative
capacity with its analytical skills. To form a living archive,
an exhibit, short structured sessions, and interactive
workshops were held, and extended oral history interviews and on-location sound recordings were collected.
ADB now has a pool of staff members trained to apply
narrative techniques supported by a major publication,
ADB: Reflections and Beyond. An accompanying audio
composition, Beyond: Stories and Sounds from ADB’s Region,
wove excerpts from the interviews to sounds from ADB’s
headquarters and the field. Yet another product was ADB
Narrative Practitioners Handbook. The successful introduction of stories and narratives in ADB significantly
enhanced its ability to value, share, and capitalize on
development impact.

Raising Awareness of Knowledge
Management and Learning

Seeds planted in knowledge products and services
blossomed into greater awareness and improved
performance throughout the year. ADB’s web pages on
knowledge management and learning (www.adb.org/
knowledge-management) were overhauled, sparking
an immediate doubling of readership. Their content
and usability were enhanced and instruments introduced to generate enthusiasm about ADB work,
including tools, methods, and approaches for know
Annual Report 2009 =. 27

ledge management and learning. Success stories
showcasing accomplishments were publicized, and
other instructive and informative materials were
disseminated. Learning for Change in ADB—which
illustrates how the parameters of a learning organization are defined and discusses how ADB can overcome key challenges—attracted worldwide attention.
Brochures, posters, bookmarks, and digital signage sent
out messages on the value of managing knowledge.

Dissemination of knowledge products took traditional and modern paths. Aside from direct distribution
to clients, audiences, and partners, and advertising
through launches, press conferences, media interviews,
and ADB websites, modern tools like blogs, tweets, social
networking facilities, e-flyers, and podcasts were used to
expand outreach and engage stakeholders.

Disclosure and Transparency

Since the approval of its public communications policy
in April 2005, ADB has become much more transparent
in the way it communicates with the public and shares
information with its stakeholders, particularly about
ADB projects.

Of initial project information documents for public and
private sector projects under preparation, 97% were disclosed
on ADB’s website (63% in 2006). Disclosure has become more
timely each year since the policy’s approval in 2005.

Policy and strategy papers, agendas, and minutes of
meetings of ADB’s Board of Directors, and summaries of
Board discussions on strategy, policies, and regional and
country partnership strategies were made public, as were
documents required for public disclosure during project
design and implementation, including environmental
assessments.

Staff members (273, including 106 from resident
missions) were briefed on the policy. The staff disclosure handbook was updated to cover new document types.
Seminars on the policy were held for development partners,
including 58 developing member country officials, and civil
society organizations in Cambodia and Viet Nam. ADB also
informed 30 network members of the NGO (Nongovernment) Forum on ADB of their right to access information
and of the status of policy implementation.

ADB continued to maintain and improve the disclosure information technology systems to adjust to changes
in business processes and to address user concerns. The

InfoUnit responded to all external requests in 4 days on
average, the maximum time limit allowed by the policy
being 30 days.

MAKING THE MOST OF
ADB RESOURCES

Improving Human Resources Management

ADB shows its commitment to institutional effectiveness
by continually improving human resources management.
‘The 2008 comprehensive review of the human resources
strategy (2005-2007) underscored the importance of
linking ADB’s human resources management to its business to support and deliver Strategy 2020’s required
results. The findings of the review and the 2008 staff
engagement survey were combined to develop a detailed,
time-bound human resources action plan. Its priority
was the development of a new strategy on which to base
workforce planning for successful implementation of
Strategy 2020, taking into account projected growth in
the number of staff from 2010 to 2012 that the fifth
general capital increase will finance. Our People Strategy
was drafted and circulated to the Board of Directors for
discussion. An equally important section of the plan
consists of measures to strengthen the human resources
function (Finance and Administration, p. 92).

Streamlining Business Processes

ADB completed an assessment of its business processes.
The work aimed to improve efficiency and streamline
processes without sacrificing quality in two areas: the
country partnership strategy and loan delivery. Working
groups were established to consider options for streamlining documentation and reducing complex processing steps and reviews. Their recommendations were
approved by Management in November.

ADB is refocusing its country partnership strategies
on the points where a country’s development plans and
Strategy 2020 intersect. This will better align ADB
resources with the national strategic planning cycle. Other
improvements in ADB’s strategies included enhanced
review processes through peer group assessments
and the creation of a single documentation platform.
In-depth sectorand thematic evaluations were unbundled

from the country partnership strategy process and merged
with ADB’s knowledge management functions. This will
permit more demand-driven analytical work to be carried
out with the participation of development partners.

Loan delivery reforms included a single concept
clearance process (combining project preparatory technical assistance and loans), the further merging of the
project preparatory phase with loan processing, and
enhanced quality assurance through a risk-based project
categorization of operations (including greater management and peer scrutiny of complex projects). Still other
reforms included more strategic and sector-focused peer
review; better use of the project administration manual in
project design, readiness, and implementation; and the
introduction of indefinite delivery contracts to mobilize
the expertise of consultants. These are expected to halve
the average time for processing loans.

Strengthening Risk Management

The Risk Management Unit was upgraded to the Office of
Risk Management on 1 October. The expanded role will
bring ADB into line with best market practice, including
those of other multilateral development banks, and ensure
greater efficiency and effectiveness of ADB’s operations.

In conjunction with the review of ADB’s policy on
exposure limits for nonsovereign operations (Review of
Exposure Limits on Nonsovereign Operations, p. 15),
ADB introduced a new risk-rating methodology for nonsovereign operations. Thisassigns loans tocategories based
onacomplete assessment of credit risk and will help ADB
gauge the potential losses and amount of capital needed
to be set aside for absorbing expected and unexpected
losses. As well as allowing for improved management of
credit risks in ADB’s nonsovereign loan and guarantee
portfolios, the methodology applies a system for considering credit risk when pricing new transactions, and adds
to efficiency by standardizing credit processes. Work is
also under way to develop an integrated risk management
system that will provide an information technology platform to monitor and manage risk more efficiently.

Audit

ADB’s loan, grant, and technical assistance operations
are audited independently by the Office of the Auditor
General (OAG). The office also conducts audits of finan-cial, accounting, risk management, and administrative
processes, and information systems. Risk assessment is at
the heart of the audit process, which is geared to strengthening internal controls and governance, and ensuring
compliance with ADB policies, procedures, and regulations. The audits achieve improvements in the effectiveness, efficiency, and economy of operational, financial,
administrative, and information technology activities.
OAG also works with Deloitte and Touche Singapore,
ADB’s newly appointed outside auditor, to ensure effective transition and proper coordination of audit activities.
Formalized principles for the selection of the outside
auditor are under discussion with the Audit Committee
of the Board of Directors. These principles will apply to
the next selection of the outside auditor, which will take
place in 2012, and will serve to further increase the transparency of the outside auditor selection process.

OAG completed 25 audits in 2009. Loan, grant, and
technical assistance portfolios of selected headquarters
divisions, resident missions, and regional offices were
reviewed in terms of their compliance with ADB policies
and procedures and contractual agreements. The audits
took account of the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness
of financial, managerial, and operating information, and
looked at whether significant loan and grant objectives
were achieved. The audits also considered the propriety of
disbursements of operational activities and the processes
for safeguarding assets.

Financial and administrative audits were conducted at headquarters and selected resident missions
and regional offices to assess the reliability of financial data and the effectiveness of operations. Treasury
reviews examined the investments of the staff retirement plan and the investment management system.
Reviews of information systems covered the independent verification and validation of the governance
of the Information Systems Technology Strategy II
program, several information technology systems
under development, and disaster recovery testing of
critical systems. Several consultant contracts were
audited to ensure the authenticity of claims. OAG
also issued six internal audit certifications to donors
of trust and grant funds upon the request of the Office
of Cofinancing Operations and in compliance with
the technical assistance letters of agreement and/or
memoranda of understanding. Throughout the year,
OAG continually monitored the progress of outstand

ing recommendations, with an emphasis on high-risk
recommendations.

Integrity and Anticorruption Activities

ADB separated its Integrity Division from OAG and
established the Office of Anticorruption and Integrity
(OAI) in October to ensure independence and impartiality in investigations and other activities pursuant to
ADB’s Anticorruption Policy. OAI serves as the reception point for allegations of fraud and corruption in
ADB-financed activity. It is responsible for conducting
independent and objective investigations of fraud and
corruption, collusive and coercive practices, conflict of
interest, and abuses. Working with other offices, OAI also
advances awareness among stakeholders of Anticorruption Policy requirements.

As part of its overall efforts to encourage the reporting
of integrity violations and misconduct, ADB introduced
provisions for whistle-blower and witness protection
within its framework for regulating staff conduct. Among
other things, the provisions establish how to respond to
whistle-blowing-related retaliation, and provide clarity on
the remedies for retaliation against whistle-blowers.

ADB received 194 new allegations related to ADBfinanced projects and ADB staff members, and sanctioned
68 individuals and 56 firms. Six project procurement—
related reviews (formerly called project procurement—
related audits) were carried out on projects in Armenia,
Cambodia, India, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines,
and Sri Lanka. Three limited project procurement—
related reviews were conducted in Mongolia. OAI held
anticorruption training sessions in Indonesia, Mongolia,
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam under two regional
technical assistance projects. The office also conducted
18 orientation seminars and 5 fraud and corruption awareness workshops as part of ADB’s continuing endeavors to
ensure that all ADB staff members observe the highest
standards of integrity and ethics.

Ethics

The Ethics Committee was established by the Board of
Directors in November 2006 to assist the Board of Directors with matters of ethics that may arise under the Code
of Conduct for Directors, Alternates, and the President
(see Board of Directors, p. 11, for details).

SECTOR AND THEMATIC
HIGHLIGHTS

ADB strengthened strategies and safeguards to support efforts of the entire
organization and development partners to facilitate sustainable and inclusive
economic growth. A new Energy Policy promoted the transition to a low-carbon
economy, putting the environment at the heart of infrastructure investments. At

a time of stress for Asia and the Pacific, ADB helped governments and the finance
sector to better serve people and responded to growing demand for assistance in
higher education. Strategies helped steer developing member countries toward
achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and to mainstream gender equality
into policies and programs.trategy 2020 envisions ADB operations focusing on

a handful of priority sectors and thematic areas

that align best with the long-term agenda for
inclusive growth. These priorities take into account the
current needs of developing member countries but
remain adaptable to demands and challenges yet to come.
ADB has mobilized its resources and strengthened its
support to meet this agenda.

CLIMATE CHANGE

ADB further strengthened its capacity to support developing member countries in meeting climate change
challenges. ADB engaged an advisory group of internationally recognized eminent persons, and drafted corporate priorities for action to provide strategic guidance to
operations. ADB completed climate change implementation plans to guide operations in its five subregions and
approved more than 40 new grant-financed programs,
which leveraged over $600 million in low-carbon, climateresilient investments. A climate change coordination unit
was established. ADB convened the High-Level Dialogue
on Climate Change to discuss imperatives for climate
action and mobilized climate finance for clean technology, climate resilience, forest protection, and renewable energy in low-income countries through the Climate
Investment Funds, the Global Environment Facility, and
the carbon market. The Future Carbon Fund provides
up-front financing for post-2012 carbon credits. ADB
also completed several ground-breaking studies on
climate change: /mpacts of Climate Change in Southeast Asia,
Improving Energy Security and Reducing Carbon Intensity in
Asia and the Pacific, Building Climate Resilience in the Agriculture
Sector in Asia and the Pacific, and Climate Change and Migration
in Asia and the Pacific.

Annual Report 2009 = 331

SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE

Energy. ADB approved a new Energy Policy to promote
energy security, universal access, and the transition to a
low-carbon economy.

The Energy Efficiency Initiative—the main vehicle
for increasing investments in clean energy to $1.0 billion
a year—was completed, with ADB’s investments reaching $2.8 billion over the last 2 years. Redubbed the Clean
Energy Program, it monitored the extent to which ADB’s
clean energy investments reduced greenhouse gas emissions, saved kilowatt-hours, and produced megawatts from
renewable energy sources.

Transport. ADB’s Sustainable ‘Transport Initiative
provided enhanced support to developing member countries in developing inclusive, clean, and energy-efficient
transport projects and policies. ADB expanded partnerships in the transport sector, which led to the launch of
the Partnership on Sustainable Low-Carbon ‘Transport
in Developing Countries. ADB signed a memorandum
of understanding with the Inter-American Development
Bank for cooperation on sustainable low-carbon transport,
and was among the 50 organizations that signed the Bellagio
Declaration on Transportation and Climate Change.

Water. ADB’s Water Financing Program continued to
promote increased investment in the water sector. By the
end of 2009, 4 years after the program was launched in
2006, ADB had processed over $8 billion in water investments. Approvals for water loans in 2009 amounted to
$1.6 billion. The Water Financing Partnership Facility,
which was established to support the project, registered
a total of $48 million in confirmed commitments from
financing partners by the end of 2009.

ADB emphasized the need for investments in sanitation “from toilet to river” in developing member countries.
Beneficiaries included Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Indonesia,
Kiribati, Pakistan, Palau, Samoa, Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan,
and Viet Nam. ADB also increased assistance for climate
change adaptation in the water sector.

Urban development. Urban environment infrastructure is a high priority under Strategy 2020, addressing
the pressing issues of climate change, poverty reduction,
and the creation of livable and sustainable cities. The
urban sector accounts for an increasing share of ADB

lending, with 20 loans totaling $2.3 billion approved
in 2009. The Cities Development Initiative for Asia,
supported by Germany, Spain, Sweden, and the Nordic
Development Fund, with operations in 16 countries,
leveraged resources with cofinancing and partnerships
with private sector operations to approve programs and
pre-feasibility studies in 11 cities. The Urban Financing
Partnership Facility, designed to provide investment
cofinancing for environmental infrastructure, and
initially supported by Sweden with $85 million in grants
and guarantees, was approved.

FINANCE AND GOVERNANCE

Finance sector development. Finance sector development lending amounted to $410 million, or about 6% of
total lending. The loans supported general finance sector
and capital market development, and finance infrastructure development for small and medium-sized enterprises, infrastructure, and housing.

Most technical assistance for finance sector development supported the preparation of lending programs or
projects; the remainder backed collective efforts by developing member countries to promote regional economic and
financial integration, international standards, and sound
practices.

Goyernance. Under the Second Governance and
Anticorruption Action Plan, ADB neared completion of
its risk assessments for several countries, focusing
on public finance management, procurement, and
anticorruption policies. ADB supported the Capacity
Development for Development Effectiveness Program,
designed to help governments of developing member
countries implement capacity development policies to
further the Accra Agenda for Action.

HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

Education. ADB responded to growing demand from
developing member countries for assistance in education with the establishment of Focus on Education,
a series of knowledge products that includes reports
on good practice in information and communication
technology for education, technical and vocational

education and training, and cost sharing and financing
in higher education. ADB also launched a regional study
and capacity development project, Higher Education in
Dynamic Asia.

Health. ADB focused on areas where its skills and experience are bringing the greatest benefits: water and sanitation
infrastructure projects; governance and public expenditure management in health programs in the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic, Mongolia, and the Philippines;
waste management in Bangladesh; and evidence-based
advocacy and policy support in collaboration with other
development partners. With the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and others, ADB helped develop
an investment case for maternal, newborn, and child
health; with the Joint United Nations Programme on
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the regional data hub for targeted
interventions in HIV programs was further developed; and
with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World
Bank, ADB initiated the Asia Pacific Health Observatory.
ADB strengthened its partnership with the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations and with the United Nations technical agencies (the Food and Agriculture Organization and
the WHO) to develop regional collaboration and capacity to
prevent and control infectious diseases. Asia was well
prepared when the H1N1 pandemic hit the region.

Millennium Development Goals. Taking into account
the 2015 deadline for the United Nations Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) and the global economic
slowdown, ADB committed $1.5 million to monitor and
accelerate the achievement of MDGs in its developing
member countries.

Working with the Economic and Social Commission
for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), ADB finalized its

   

ADB supports equal-opportunity education in Indonesia2009 MDG progress report, which discusses the effects
of the global economic slowdown on MDGs and recommends ways to prevent backsliding. ADB also discussed
the need for social protection in developing member
countries with programs on social assistance, conditional
cash transfers, and community-driven development.

Gender mainstreaming in ADB operations. ADB set
targets to achieve “gender mainstreaming”—the inclusion of gender-related analyses in program and project
design—in 40% of public sector projects and in 50% of
Asian Development Fund (ADF) projects by 2012. It
established the interdepartmental Technical Working
Group on Gender Mainstreaming to find ways to achieve
the targets and reverse the retrogression of recent years.
ADB also monitored pipeline projects for gender mainstreaming opportunities, increased the number of gender
specialists in regional departments, conducted briefings,
and developed reference materials.

‘The Gender and Development Plan of Action 20082010 continued to focus on accelerated gender mainstreaming in country partnership strategies and projects,
enhanced policy dialogue and capacity support to
developing member countries, and improved organizational effectiveness. Country gender assessments were
conducted for Mongolia and Nepal. Gender specialists
in 11 ADB resident missions continued to influence
gender-responsive programming at the country level
and provide oversight to ensure gender-responsive
projects.

The number of projects that mainstreamed gender
increased. More innovative gender mainstreaming
designs were developed and applied. Rapid gender
assessments of ongoing projects in Indonesia, Mongolia,
Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam noted positive and tangible
gender equality results from gender action plans in
tural development, education, and water supply and
sanitation.

ENVIRONMENT AND SAFEGUARDS

ADB approved 33 environmental sustainability projects
totaling $3.7 billion, representing 27% more projects and
48% more funding than in 2008. It approved 91 technical

Other key activities included protecting critical biodiversity in the Greater Mekong Subregion; financing and
implementing a marine conservation program in the Coral
Triangle, source of food and income for about 120 million
people; and supporting the Heart of Borneo Initiative to
preserve the largest remaining forest in Southeast Asia.
ADB also approved its Safeguard Policy Statement (see
Policy and Strategy Overview, p. 15).

CROSSCUTTING INITIATIVES

Agriculture and food security. ADB approved seven
loans for agriculture and natural resources, totaling $443
million. Its non-loan fund of $154 million attracted
$36 million in cofinancing. The new Agriculture, Rural
Development, and Food Security Unit supervised ADB’s
regional research programs, formulated a regional agriculture research agenda as part of the global research
program of the Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research, and commissioned a study on
Building Climate Resilience in the Agriculture Sector of
Asia and the Pacific.

Emergency assistance and disaster risk management.
ADB approved the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund,
which provides grants of up to $3 million to help governments cover the immediate costs of responses to natural
disasters. Grants have been given to Indonesia (earthquake), the Philippines (typhoon), and Samoa (tsunami).

Information and communication technology. By the
end of 2009, there were 214 ADB-supported projects
involving information and communication technology
(ICT), including 76 loans and 138 technical assistance
projects and grants. They have helped developing member
countries improve ICT infrastructure; enhance ICT
literacy and professional skills; and develop ICT applications, e-services, and content.

ADB committed $1.5 million
to monitor and accelerate the
achievement of Millennium
Development Goals in its
developing member countries

for strengthening the capacity of developing member
countries in managing credit enhancement products was
launched during 2009.ADB establishes framework cofinancing agreements
with its cofinanciers to effectively create a pipeline of
future cofinancing operations. Such a programmatic
approach to cofinancing gives predictability to ADB’s
cofinancing operations, moves cofinancing upstream, and
allows the use of standardized, project-specific cofinancing agreement templates that streamline cofinancing
operations. By the end of 2009, six framework agreements were in effect, the total value of which amounted
to approximately $9 billion over the coming 2-3 years. In
2009, ADB signed a framework cofinancing agreement
with the Export-Import Bank of China for $1.5 billion
over 3 years for the cofinancing of infrastructure projects.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
OPERATIONS

A total of 313 technical assistance projects for $267.2
million, including 267 new and 46 supplementary projects, was approved, or 2.2% less than the 298 projects for
$273.2 million approved in 2008. Of the 313 technical
assistance projects, 88 are project preparatory, 114 are
capacity development, 71 are policy and advisory, and 40
are research and development.

NONSOVEREIGN OPERATIONS

ADB approved a total of 12 financial markets and infra
structure nonsovereign projects, providing about
$1.6 billion in assistance (Table 6). The interventions
comprise five private sector loans of $309 million; two
public sector nonsovereign loans of $134 million; five
equity investments of $220 million; a credit guarantee of
$72 million and, as mentioned above, an increase in the
total exposure limit of the Trade Finance Facilitation
Program by $850 million to $1 billion in 2009.

As of 31 December, the total outstanding balances
and undisbursed commitments of nonsovereign operations amounted to about $4.5 billion, consisting of loans
of $2.6 billion, $1.1 billion in equity investments, and
guarantees of $740.0 million. ADB’s nonsovereign exposure is largest in the infrastructure sector, with a total
of $ 2.7 billion, followed by the finance sector with exposure of $ 1.7 billion, and other sectors with exposure of
$70.0 million.

Annual Report 2009 89

Cumulative nonsovereign operations are largest in
the People’s Republic of China (20.4%), followed by India
(20%), followed by Indonesia (9%), and the Philippines
(7%). Regional projects account for roughly 18% of the total
(Table 7).

RESOURCE TRANSFERS

During the year, there was a net transfer of $6.0 billion
from ADB to its developing countries, compared with
$4.3 billion in 2008. Of these, net resource transfers of
$4.9 billion went to OCR borrowers and/or investors in
2009, compared with $3.2 billion in 2008 (Table 8). The
four countries with the largest net resource transfers
were India, Viet Nam, the Philippines, and the People’s
Republic of China.

Loan disbursements totaled $10.1 billion compared
with $8.5 billion in 2008. Of the total, OCR disbursements
were $7.9 billion or 78% and ADF disbursements were
$2.2 billion, or 22%. Loan service payments totaled
$4.1 billion in 2009 compared with $4.3 billion in 2008.

The provision of regional transport connectivity, energy security and
efficiency, urban services, and finance sector and government reforms
formed the bedrock of ADB assistance. Approval was given to build a
railway linking Uzbekistan and Afghanistan as a flagship transport project
for the region. The eight countries in the Central Asia Regional Economic
Cooperation program endorsed an action plan for the energy sector.CENTRAL AND WEST ASIA |

42 Asian Development Bank

OVERVIEW

DB strategy highlights transport and logistics,
energy security and efficiency, urban services
(water, wastewater, and urban transport), and
reforms (government efficiency, access to credit, and
capital markets development). The strategy is delivered
through transactions structured around debt and equity
finance, guarantees, and grants. Accompanying technical assistance grants train clients in planning, project
management, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting.
Regional cooperation, environmental sustainability,
climate change, and gender are emphasized.
Disbursements rose to $2.2 billion (Table 10). New
lending for public sector projects and reforms reached
$3.1 billion.

PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE

More effective project management resulted from cooperation between client and ADB teams, supported by
an improved management information system covering
project performance. A “no extension” policy on poorly
performing projects ensured timely, within-budget project
execution. Portfolio performance also benefited from
clearer readiness filters, simplified design, and advance
actions on procurement, safeguards compliance, and
timely counterpart finance. ADB continued to rely on
programmatic financing approaches, using multitranche
financing facilities and cluster program loans. The analyt
ical work shifted to the start of the project, increasing
time and resources for implementation, and paving the
way for longer term partnerships and faster approval. Total
multitranche financing in 2009 reached almost $3 billion.

REGIONAL COOPERATION

The Eighth Ministerial Conference on Central Asia
Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC), held in
Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, deepened cooperation among
CAREC countries (Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People’s
Republic of China, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic,
Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan). The conference
endorsed an action plan for the energy sector and agreed
on the establishment of a comprehensive results framework for the CAREC program. A yearly effectiveness
report will become a standard feature of the program.
ADB approved a flagship regional transport
project—a new railway line connecting Hairatan in
Uzbekistan to Mazar-e-Sharif in Afghanistan. This initiated a three-phase program to develop a rail network

Clean Water on Tap

A program in the Kyrgyz Republic is providing

yet most people must walk miles to the nearest river
to meet their daily needs. Thanks to an ADB grant, water is
coming closer to home.

Abdymanap lives with his family in Josholu, a village in
the mountainous Alai district in the south of the country.
Before ADB helped the village construct a pipe as part of
a project to improve rural water supply and sanitation, the
local river served villagers’ needs. “Water in the river was not
bad,” he says. “But during the rainy season it turned brown
because of the dirt.” Villagers had to leave the water in

buckets for a few hours for the dirt to settle, Abdymanap
explains. In any case, cows and sheep would drink from the
river and pollute it with their wastes.

“People were getting infections from the water before
the water pipe was built,” says Janargul, a nurse at the local
hospital. Diarrhea was common and the hospital was so
short of water that nurses had to carry bucketfuls from the
nearest river 3 kilometers away.

The ADB-financed project, known as Tazasuu (clean
water), enabled local communities to construct water pipes.

Josholu is typical of the many communities across the
country that have benefited from the project. The village now
boasts 56 standpipes, which provide its 4,500 inhabitants
with fresh, clean spring water from the mountains. The
source springs are protected by a tent to keep out rainwater
and animal waste, and pipes carry the water from the spring
to a reservoir above the village. The reservoir can hold up to
500,000 liters, enough to provide water to the village for 1
day, in case the springs stop running.

Abdashym, who takes care of the reservoir, does not
believe the springs will run dry. “It will never happen,” he
says. “But even if it does, the village will not stay without
water for very long.”

Supplies are assured by a backup system that can take
water from the river, filter it, and take it to the village.

Fetching water is no longer a big issue for the women,
as water is readily available at the standpipe just around
the corner. Children have less work to do and more time
to play and study—and they have water on tap to drink
whenever they like.

multimedia lessons in mathematics.

A teacher since 1990, she completed in-service teacher
training in information technology in June 2009, part of
the ongoing ADB-funded Information and Communication Technology in Basic Education Project.

“Learning is more interactive using computers, and
students learn far faster than the old ways,” Viktorovna
says. "They are able to access a lot more information on
various subjects, too.”

Under the umbrella of the government's National Program for Basic Education Development, the project aimed
to put information and communication technology (ICT)
in schools. Before the project began in 2006, computer
access for students was limited to 18% of secondary and
half of all schools.

Computers installed in September 2009 are already
improving education for 1,700 students, says Tamara

 

Uzbek students hone their information technology skills

Samoylovich, head of the teaching department at
Tashkent’s Secondary School Number 94. Hers is one
of 860 cluster leader schools—hubs for an average of
11 other schools—where the government is providing ICT.

When the entire network is operational, 540,000
students in 9,757 cluster leader schools will directly
benefit. Their central role means all students and teachers—about 6 million students and 200,000 teachers over
5 years—will gain computer skills. ADB financed $30 million of the $43 million cost of the project.

Cluster leader schools act as resource centers for surrounding schools typically up to 30 kilometers away. By
offering two computer classes—one for students and another for teachers—to surrounding schools, the opportunity for teachers to train and spread knowledge is readily
available.

The project contains specific measures that directly impact about 165,000 poor students in grades five through
nine. For example, the project ensures 70% of the cluster
leader schools are in rural and poor areas.

Materials in languages, including Karakalpak, Kazakh,
Korean, Kyrgyz, Russian, Tajik, and Turkmen, provide a
leg up for minority students. Pilot projects are also testing
alternative ways of connecting remote schools, including
the use of digitized phone lines, or mobile and wireless
connections.

"ICT literacy has increased dramatically since the
project was launched,” says Sayora Melikova, director of
School Number 21 in Samarkand City. “Before, computers were for grades eight and nine, but now grades five
through nine have them, too,” she says. Tertiary education
is computer-based these days, so ICT study is critical to
students’ further education.

"This project is giving them a head start,” says
Melikova.

Priorities include roads, energy, and investment climate
reforms. To enhance aid efficiency and improve donor
coordination, ADB and 11 development partners signed
the Joint Country Partnership Strategy 2010-2012.

Impact of operations. ADB projects improved transport connectivity and energy security. Irrigation and
flood protection projects increased agricultural
productivity. ADB approved a $40 million program to
sustain social spending imperiled by the global economic
crisis, helping the government manage budget shortfalls
and supporting public investments that preserve and

create jobs. ADB provided a $20 million grant to supple
ment the Dushanbe-Kyrgyz Border Road Rehabilitation
Project, which is upgrading highways within the CAREC
corridor.

for environmentally sustainable power generation and
regional highway corridors.

Impact of operations. Since 1996, ADB has financed
30 loans totaling $1.3 billion. Resource transfers more
than doubled from 2008 as more frequent interactions
between government officials and ADB improved portfolio performance. Farmers’ income increased because ofa

OVERVIEW

DB operations in East Asia were guided by Stra
tegy 2020 and the need to respond to the effects

of the global financial crisis on the PRC and
Mongolia. In the PRC, ADB lending complemented
the government’s massive fiscal stimulus program that
moderated the impact of the crisis on the economy.
Support for post-disaster rehabilitation, energy efficiency
in transportation, natural resource conservation, and
integrated urban-rural development were the highlights
of lending operations. In Mongolia, ADB helped develop
a social program that improved access of the poor to basic
social services. ADB also promoted nonsovereign lending
and private—-public partnerships in infrastructure, and
measurable progress was made in renewable energy projects in the PRC. In both countries, ADB provided technical assistance to increase access to financial services,
support social services, promote clean technology and
alternative energy, facilitate trade among neighboring
countries, and enhance regional cooperation.

Total lending operations (Table 15) in the PRC
consisted of 12 sovereign loans for $1.8 billion and 3 nonsovereign loans for $192.9 million. For Mongolia, financial
assistance included two Asian Development Fund (ADF)
grants totaling $33.9 million, of which $16.9 million was
made in conjunction with an ADF loan of $43.1 million

Partnership priorities. The 2008-2010 country partnership strategy remains closely aligned both with the
government’s Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2006-2010)
and ADB’s Strategy 2020 priorities. The global financial crisis highlighted the urgency of rebalancing from
export-oriented, investment-driven growth to a consumption-driven, service-oriented economy. Another emerging
challenge was to reinforce environmentally sustainable
development by addressing climate change issues and
adopting greener, low-carbon growth strategies.

Impact of operations. Most projects were in the lessdeveloped central and western regions of the PRC, where
rural poverty and environmental degradation are more
pronounced. Greening of the portfolio was achieved
through the railway energy efficiency program under the
multitranche financing facility and a nonsovereign wind
power project in Hebei Province. Preparatory work was
initiated for innovative projects such as the 250-megawatt Tianjin integrated gasification combined cycle
project and a concentrated solar thermal power development project in the western PRC while carbon capture
and storage demonstration studies were started to identify barriers, develop road maps, and to identify potential projects. ADB continued its support for balanced and
environmentally sustainable urbanization of small cities
and towns in Hebei, Liaoning, and Shanxi provinces.

ADB, with the Ministry of Finance, organized a
national workshop to promote sustainable urban development. The PRC-ADB knowledge-sharing platform,
with its first event on sustainable urbanization, facilitated exchange between the PRC and other developing
member countries on urban development.

Impact of operations. ADB helped the government
start reforms in the health insurance system, improving
the financing of hospitals and rural health facilities, and
developing incentives to encourage health workers to work
in rural areas. ADB also supported overhauling the legal
status of family group practices and strengthening the
legal and regulatory basis for public-private partnership
initiatives in the health sector. In education, an ADF
grant ensured that those most affected by the crisis stay
in school by helping the government meet its short-term

financing needs and by continuing longer-term policy
reform.

Two projects funded through the Japan Fund
for Poverty Reduction sought to promote community
natural resource management by introducing alternative
livelihoods to the rural poor. A grant of $14.7 million in
2008 supported an innovative private sector development
approach in agro-processing that helped the rural poor
by expanding value chain processing of food products,
marketing, and exports.

 

Methane: From Pollution to Solution

An ADB project is helping the PRC safely capture
methane gas extracted from coal mines, and at
the same time providing consumers, such as in
Jincheng, clean alternative energy sources

shops in Jincheng, Shanxi province breathe easier

now because the company’s switch from coal to
methane gas to fuel its furnaces has improved air quality
in the factory and greatly reduced the incidence of respiratory disease. The furnace upgrade saves the company
$147.10 (CNY1,000) per day, and because the consistent
gas supply keeps the temperature of the furnaces steady,
the glass melts evenly without trapping bubbles, reducing wastage by 20%.

The methane that fuels the glassworks is tapped from
the city’s extensive coal deposits. Methane is highly explosive
and must be extracted from the underground coal mines to
keep working conditions safe. But once captured it is one

of the cleaner energy sources since it produces no soot and
does not contribute to acid rain, and it can replace dirty
fuels such as coal and petroleum.

A $117.4 million loan from ADB helped introduce
new technologies that can increase the production and
use of methane. Begun in 2004, the Coal Mine Methane
Development Project in Jincheng captures coal mine
methane from mine shafts to fuel a 120-megawatt
power plant, and transmits and distributes methane to
commercial, residential, and industrial consumers in the
city.
For Wei Jiusheng, who drives a methane-powered
taxi, the availability of this cleaner, cheaper fuel is a boon.
When Wei used gasoline, filling the fuel tank was so costly
that he was barely able to support his wife and child. Now
that he has converted his car to methane gas, he earns
an average of $440 a month (CNY3,000), substantially
more than most drivers in his city. To reduce air pollution
and promote the use of methane gas, the municipal
government later made the conversion mandatory for all
taxis and buses, and many owners of private vehicles have
made the switch, too.

Households also make major savings now that coal
mine methane is widely available on tap. The average
annual cost for gas supply for a family is $52 (CNY350),
compared with $294 (CNY2,000) for coal. Making piped
gas available not only reduced households’ expenses but
also liberated women from time-consuming cooking. The
Jincheng municipal government plans to cover the whole
city with pipelines to supply over 60,000 households with
coal mine methane for heating and cooking by 2011.

Once captured, methane gas is
one of the cleaner energy sources
since it produces no soot and does

Education Comes in From the Cold

Mongolia’s extensive Second Education Development Project has constructed new schools,
rehabilitated old ones, provided educational
materials, trained teachers, and revised school
policy, among its many achievements. Preschool
enrollment has increased substantially

OVERVIEW

DB helps 14 Pacific developing member countries
raise living standards and build resilience by developing economic and social infrastructure, strengthening governance, and promoting private sector growth.
Innovative approaches continued meeting the region’s
unique challenges. ADB has scaled up its lending and
nonlending operations in response to increasing demand
from Pacific countries. The Pacific Approach 2010-2014,
produced in 2009, aims to improve the effectiveness of
future ADB development operations in the Pacific.
Frequent high-level consultation improved coordination among development partners, laying the groundwork
for a regional approach to the global economic crisis and
deepening the response to climate change. This included
ADB strengthening its partnership with the US government.

Fund (ADF) grants, contract awards were 79.3% ($15.7
million) and disbursements 90.5% ($14.1 million). The
Pacific Department’s achievements in contract awards
were the best in the past 10 years. The number of active
technical assistance projects averaged 82 over the past 3
years. Technical assistance savings were $2.3 million.
Five loans, four grant projects, and two technical assistance projects were delegated to the resident missions
in 2009, resulting in more effective monitoring, stronger
partnerships with Pacific developing member countries
and development partners, and improved engagement in
policy dialogue.

REGIONAL COOPERATION

The Pacific Approach 2010-2014 supports strengthened
regional cooperation, the regional provision of services,
and better policies.

ADB approved a regional technical assistance project to improve its engagement in fragile states and
situations. The Infrastructure Advisory Center, established under the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility,
will help Pacific countries develop sustainable infrastructure and services. ADF investments in border roads

Papua New Guinea

Partnership priorities. The midterm review of ADB’s
country strategy and program 2006-2010 confirmed the
rationale and validity of the four strategic priorities: public
financial management, private sector development, infrastructure, and health and HIV/AIDS.

ADB’s first private sector project in Papua New
Guinea was approved and disbursed in 2009. A total of $18
million was disbursed for the expansion and improvement
of a nationwide mobile telecommunication network, which
increases access to affordable telecommunication services,
particularly for low-income users, and improves their accessibility and quality, particularly in the country’s remote and
rural areas.

Impact of operations. Ongoing ADB. assistance
improved the Highlands highway network and national
road safety. ADB also strengthened support for private
sector participation and development by providing
assistance for the implementation of the national
public-private partnership policy and in the delivery of
rural health services, including HIV/AIDS prevention.
The private sector was tapped to improve the supply
and distribution of medical supplies. An ADB-supported
project established a financial literacy and outreach
program, and continued to strengthen the successful
Nationwide Microbank, which grew to 12 branches.

Restoring the Reef

practices through a community-based approach

hope of finding a few small shells and peanut worms.

Two hours away, on a palm-fringed coast on the other

The contrast between these two stretches of water reveals
much about the story of Papua New Guinea's declining
coastal resources—and the efforts of some communities to
reverse the trend.

"This area has been totally overfished because it is near
town, very accessible, and there are no restrictions or management of the reef,” a resident complains on the beach outside Kavieng, the main port of New Ireland. “The people who

come here have no idea about the importance of managing
these resources.”

The big prizes—sea cucumbers, trochus shells (used to
make mother-of-pearl buttons), and reef fish—have vanished
because of the twin pressures of growing coastal populations
and destructive fishing practices.

By contrast, villagers of Panakais on the west coast have
established a no-fishing zone, although on this day they give
themselves permission to break the ban for a special feast.
The community has also renounced poisoning fish with derris root powder, fishing with dynamite, and night fishing
by flashlight using fine-mesh nets as part of a self-imposed
management plan drawn up with the help of Ailan Awareness, a local nongovernment organization.

“They told us in a scientific way why we should not catch
small fish and why we should leave the spawning fish alone,”
says Francis Bolaf, chair of Panakais’ fisheries management
committee.

The community-based management approach to conserving marine resources has been pioneered through the
Coastal Fisheries Management and Development Project,
financed by ADB with a $5.7 million soft loan. Seven communities in New Ireland and another 17 in Morong province
had applied the methods by the time the project ended in
2007. A further 37 were waiting to participate.

“Our project was to kick-start this concept and pilot it,
and I’m happy that this has been achieved and we would
like to see it replicated throughout the coast,” said Allan Lee,
officer-in-charge at the ADB resident mission in Port Moresby.

As more communities decide to make short-term sacrifices for long-term gains, the tide could turn for Papua New
Guinea’s once bountiful reefs.

On the Same Track

Through post-conflict reconstruction, such as in
Solomon Islands, ADB is helping governments
restore fragile connections. The successful project has rebuilt roads and bridges, providing a
lifeline to markets and hospitals

West Guadalcanal to sell mangoes in Honiara, the

capital of Solomon Islands. The 80-kilometer round trip
used to take her about 6 hours on a route damaged in conflict
more than a decade ago. She can now cover that ground in
2 hours, after ADB's Post-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation
Project restored roads and bridges.

Bridges were bombed and major roads linking provincial
and market centers with communities in Guadalcanal and
the Island of Malaita were severely damaged during ethnic
tensions that afflicted this South Pacific archipelago in
1999-2000. An October 2000 peace agreement ended
conflict between groups from Guadalcanal and Malaita
provinces, but communities were left without access to
markets, clinics, schools, and agricultural services.

“Frankly speaking, these were the worst conditions
I'd seen in nearly 30 years of working on road projects,”

Ss times a week, Mary Puke travels from Visale in

 

 

The project rejoins communities separated by conflict

says Rishi Adhar of ADB's Pacific Liaison and Coordination
Office, who worked on the project, which started in 2002.

Additional funding made available by the Australian
Agency for International Development (AusAID), through
its Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, and
the New Zealand Agency for International Development
(NZAID) helped expand the rehabilitation project and avoid
duplication of efforts. “By pooling our different ideas, we
generally come up with a much better result,” NZAID manager Guy Redding says.

The restoration of important transport links like the
Tanavasa Bridge—the “Bridge of Peace,” which had been
blown up during the conflict—is a tangible symbol of the
trust and cooperation that now exists between communities previously at war.

“The project has been widely regarded as being successful, delivering on its original objectives in an environment
that was still fragile,” says Paul Kelly, RAMSI development
coordinator. “It also contributed to economic growth in
Solomon Islands. A working network of improved roads and
bridges, particularly in rural areas, has joined communities
together and become a lifeline to markets and hospitals.”

The Solomon Islands Road Improvement Project is the
next big transport rehabilitation project. This will build on
the work of ADB's Post-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation
Project, spreading the gains more widely. Policy advice and
capacity building for the Ministry of Infrastructure is part of
the package, and there are plans to involve youth, school
dropouts, and women’s groups in local road maintenance
to maximize the useful life of these arteries of commerce and
peaceful existence.

The restoration of important
transport links such as the
“Bridge of Peace” is a tangible
symbol of the trust and
cooperation that now exists
between communitiesTimor-Leste

Partnership priorities. ADB priorities include infrastructure, public administration, and ongoing support
for the Instituicao de Microfinancas de Timor-Leste.
Regional technical assistance was also approved to
improve cross-border linkages between Indonesia and
Timor-Leste.

Impact of operations. The concluded $10 million ADF
Road Sector Improvement Project rehabilitated about
123 km of deteriorated national roads, piloted road
maintenance on 47 km of national roads using laborintensive methods, and engaged roadside communities in
feeder road maintenance.

Tonga

Partnership priorities. The joint ADB—World Bank field
presence in Tonga has strengthened country-level interaction. A budget support program grant will help mitigate
the impact of the global economic crisis.

Impact of operations. ADB supported state-owned
enterprise (SOE) reforms. Finding the Balance, a 2009
comparative study of SOE performance, rated ‘Tonga as
having outperformed the Fiji Islands and Samoa in SOE
reform.

COUNTRY HIGHLIGHTS
Bangladesh

Partnership priorities. The midterm review of the
country partnership strategy, 2006-2010, completed
in August, validated its strategic pillars (sustainable
economic growth, inclusive social development, and good
governance) while underscoring the need for greater
investment in basic infrastructure and further progress on
economic and governance reforms.

ADB mobilized additional financing to support
government efforts to stimulate economic recovery
and improve social safety net programs, and funds were
redirected from ongoing projects for emergency postcyclone rehabilitation. ADB also extended its support

for small-scale water resources and small and mediumsized enterprises. Ten loans were approved totaling
$1 billion.

Impact of operations. ADB’s support for primary
education engendered progress in several key performance indicators. The sector-wide approach fostered

harmony among development partners and reduced
transaction costs for the government. The design of
the Padma Multipurpose Bridge was initiated with
ADB support, and additional resources were provided
through a supplementary loan to accelerate preparation of this high-priority project. The Northwest Crop
Diversification Project substantially raised the incomes

well-equipped health care center was free of the stress
she experienced in her previous deliveries.

“| have had two children at home in deliveries that had a
lot of anxieties and difficulties, but here | have had no worries,”
Akter, who is 29, said as she rested after giving birth to a healthy
boy at the center run by Progoti Samaj Kallyan Protisthan, a nongovernment organization (NGO) running health care centers in
Dhaka operated under the Second Urban Primary Health Care
Project in partnership with the Government of Bangladesh.

Akter’s experience is typical of women across the country
who have benefited from an innovative tie-up between local
governments and NGOs to deliver primary health care to poor
urban communities. Such public-private partnerships provide
facilities and services to six city corporations and five municipalities across Bangladesh.

Building on an earlier ADB project, this initiative aims to
reach underserved communities and, in particular, to improve
child and maternal health in areas where mortality rates remain high. The under-5 child mortality is 65 per 1,000 births;
41% of children under 5 are underweight, 12% severely so.

ee Akter says the birth of her third child at a

 

A baby gets treatment at an ADB-funded health center

Only 52% of pregnant women obtain antenatal care from a
medically trained provider and only 15% of births take place in
health care facilities.

“We believe our health centers have contributed to a substantial reduction in child and maternal mortality and morbidity in Bangladesh,” said Kazi Nurun Nabi, project manager
of Progoti Samaj Kallyan Protisthan, who oversees an average
of five deliveries per day at the maternity center where Akter
gave birth.

So far the project has established 116 primary health care
centers and 9 comprehensive reproductive health care centers;
41 more health care facilities and 42 community toilets will be
built before the project closes at the end of 2011.

The centers also provide other medical treatment,
vaccinations, family planning and nutritional advice, and
education on primary health care. The project targets care to
the most needy: at least 30% of the health centers’ free services
reach the urban poor, and nutritional supplements are supplied
to severely malnourished women and children. Satellite clinics
in slum areas treat patients who cannot come to the main
health centers. The project has assisted more than 100,000
institutional deliveries, and over 5 million have benefited so far
from the project.

The government is responsible for devising and overseeing
the program, while NGOs deliver the health care and family
planning services.

The project is financed mainly by ADB with cofinance from
the Department for International Development (DFID) of the
United Kingdom, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), and the United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA). ORBIS, an international NGO, helps the project provide
primary eye care services.

Bhutan

Partnership priorities. The July midterm review of the
Bhutan country partnership strategy concluded that the
strategy of poverty reduction through program and project
assistance in four core sectors (roads, power and rural electrification, urban infrastructure, and financial and private
sector development) and capacity development in these
sectors is fully aligned with the government’s Tenth Plan

Annual Report 2009 75

and ADB’s Strategy 2020. The review recommended
continued implementation as planned.

Impact of operations. Accessibility is Bhutan’s key
development issue. The Road Network II Project
increased passenger and freight transport within the
country and with India, and integrated the southern
region with its primary markets through the expanded
road network and accessible border crossings. ADB’s
power interventions enabled poor households to establish income-generating microenterprises and strengthened small-scale cottage industries benefiting from

 

Paving the Way to Prosperity

Bhutan is upgrading and extending its roads and
highways, dramatically improving road safety
and livelihoods for farmers, business people, and
transport workers

Bhutan’s treacherous mountain roads, white-knuckle
experiences that left him inches from plunging to certain death.

The 27-year-old truck driver has fewer hair-raising tales
after ADB assisted in the renovation and upgrading of 328
kilometers (km) of the East-West Highway, a vital passage that
connects the two sides of the country. All-weather pavement
was installed on the single highway bisecting the country,
along with concrete barriers on the most dangerous curves.

“It's still dangerous,” said Tamang, “but now my wife
doesn't worry that | won't come home alive when | have to drive
cross-country.”

Vehicular transport in Bhutan, which did not have a single
car until the 1960s, has grown rapidly in recent years, but
the country’s road network, comprising 4,153 km of drivable
roads, provides only limited coverage and cannot meet the
growing demands of larger and heavier vehicles.

E udhbir Tamang tells stories of close calls driving on

   

Driving on Bhutan‘s highways is a lot safer these days, says truck
driver Budhbir Tamang

The government partnered with ADB to meet Bhutan’s
transport needs. ADB has provided four loans and two grants
totaling $85.9 million, and has helped build or upgrade
346 km of roads and highways. The Bhutan Road Improvement Project has reduced vehicle operating costs by 19%38%, cut travel time by 25%, and benefited nearly 100,000
people, according to an independent evaluation by ADB.

ADB is also working to improve about 140 km of the
Trongsa-Gelephu highway—the vital route linking Bhutan to
the India border—and about 100 km of other important road
sections.

“The benefits of that project have been immense,” says
Pherub Phuntsho, an engineer with Bhutan’s Department of
Roads, who reports that heavy vehicle and bus accidents have
fallen dramatically.

The impact of upgrading the East-West Highway is
highly visible. Traffic in some sections of the highway has
increased from as few as 4 or 5 vehicles per day before improvement to 300 or 400 vehicles per day, and twice as
much in other sections.

Temphey, a 50-year-old farmer living near the western
city of Wangdue, has also benefited immensely as a result
of the highway improvement. The farmer of potatoes, radishes, and chili peppers used to spend more than a day
hauling his goods to market by ox. Today, it takes about an
hour to get his goods to market.

“| used to live like the ox in the field,” Temphey says.
“Now, my work is easier and | can spend more time with
my family.”

microcredit under ADB’s Small and Medium Enterprises Sector Development Program. The finance
sector was stronger because of sustained regulatory and
policy development assistance. Access and electrification have allowed the government to establish schools
and health units, increasing ADB’s direct and indirect
contribution to poverty reduction and achievement of
the Millennium Development Goals.

India

Partnership priorities. The country partnership strategy
2009-2012 will speed up poverty reduction and social
development. It will strengthen ADB support for infrastructure development, promote public-private partnerships in infrastructure development, support climate
change adaptation and mitigation, and encourage innovative financing. Results and knowledge creation will also
be enhanced.

Impact of operations. The Chhattisgarh Irrigation
Development Project improved irrigation infrastructure and agriculture extension services, leading to an
estimated 50% yield increase in irrigated rice and 30%
in wheat and the piloting of new cash crops. The $100
million Assam Power Sector Development Program,
2003-2009, helped restructure the Assam State Electricity Board, developed tariff rules, funded an electric
service billing system, and lowered transmission and
distribution system losses. Power supply was made more
reliable and 1,200 villages were connected to the grid.
ADB financed 24 projects under the first tranche of the
India Infrastructure Project Financing Facility, 20082010, leveraging more than 10 times its own resources
from other commercial sources.

The country partnership strategy
2009-2012 for India aims to
speed up poverty reduction and
social development, help build
infrastructure, promote publicprivate partnerships, support
climate change adaptation, and
encourage innovative financing

The Maldives

Partnership priorities. Under the country partnership
strategy, ADB and the government agreed to augment
human resources capacity, a binding constraint in the
Maldives; strengthen economic management; improve
development effectiveness; and provide assistance for
private sector development, energy, and transport with
an emphasis on public-private partnership. The strategy
contains a provision for ADB to respond quickly if circumstances change. The recent global economic slowdown
has adversely affected the Maldives, and ADB approved
quick-disbursing assistance to support the government’s
economic reform program.

Impact of operations. The Economic Recovery Program
contributed $35 million to a government emergency
program supported by international financial institutions
that sought to correct underlying economic distortions
and restore a sustainable medium-term growth trajectory.
By supporting structural reforms, the program facilitated
progress toward more broad-based and sustainable development, thereby reducing vulnerability to external shocks.

Nepal

Partnership priorities. The country partnership strategy, 2010-2012, was prepared based on consultations

 

Donor Partnership in Formulating
Country Strategies for Nepal

DB’s country partnership strategy for Nepal

f \ 2010-2012 was formulated through stake
holder consultations in partnership with the

United Kingdom's Department for International De
velopment and the World Bank. Consultations solicited

feedback on Nepal’s development priorities, and explored
ways to ensure programs’ development effectiveness.

Asecond round of consultations was held in December
to provide feedback to stakeholders on the development
partners’ country strategies and discuss implementation
challenges.

The donor partnership was extended to sector and thematic assessments, such as critical development constraints,
gender equality and social inclusion, and climate change
assessments. A “peace filter” was developed as a conflictsensitive tool for project design and implementation.Annual Report 2009 a

ADB's country partnership in Nepal aims to sustain the gains of the peace process

with key stakeholders, including other development
partners. It aims to sustain the gains of the peace process
by promoting broad-based inclusive economic growth,
inclusive social development, governance and capacity
building, climate change adaptation, and environmental
sustainability. The December participatory country portfolio review focused on development effectiveness. ADB
approved six projects for $336.2 million in Asian Development Fund (ADF) loans and grants and approved nine
technical assistance grants for $5.8 million.

Impact of operations. The Crop Diversification Project
completed in December 2008 improved the productivity
of secondary crops in 12 mid- and far-western districts.
Extensive social mobilization, innovative agriculture
extension services, and processing and marketing
services helped increase production, raise incomes of
participants, and improve nutritional status. An additional 14,963 person-years of employment were created.

Sri Lanka

Partnership priorities. In line with the country partnership strategy, 2009-2011, ADB projects supported fiscal
management, roads and transport, energy, water supply,
and education. ADB focused on postwar development
efforts when the long war against separatist rebels ended
in mid-2009. ADB approved $330 million in loans for
three projects: the $160 million Clean Energy and Access
Improvement Project, the $70 million Eastern and North
Central Provincial Road Project, and the $100 million
Greater Colombo Wastewater Management Project.

Impact of operations. The Road Network Improvement
Project improved 309 kilometers (km) of national roads
and rehabilitated 450 km of flood-damaged roads. The
Road Sector Development Project completed 800 km of
provincial roads. A 153 km road, cofinanced by the European Union, connected the South and East of Sri Lanka.
ADB continued to assist development in the previously
conflict-affected northern and eastern provinces. Assistance for water supply and sanitation provided 2 million
people with safe water. ADB supported the modernization of secondary education, the development of a
distance education network, and expanded access to
higher education.

REGIONAL COOPERATION

ADB achieved new milestones in its subregional programs
within the Brunei Darussalam—Indonesia—Malaysia—
Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP—EAGA), the
Indonesia—Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT—
GT), and the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), and
enhanced collaboration with the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) Secretariat. The BIMP—EAGA
member countries agreed to facilitate interstate transport
and to accelerate infrastructure development, and ADB
helped them identify projects and prepare a program of

12 high-priority transport and energy projects for 2010—
2011, worth about $1 billion, and fast-track implementation of these projects.

Leaders of the IMT'—GT countries agreed to accelerate the implementation of connectivity corridors. ADB
helped identify and include eight priority projects in the
IMT-GT pipeline with an estimated total cost of $2.5
billion. A midterm review of the IMT—GT Road Map
and a parallel review of IMT—GT business processes are
being undertaken to ensure effective implementation.
ADB supported and provided advice to the Center for
IMT—GT Cooperation.In the GMS, ADB continued to prioritize infrastructure projects to expedite development of integrated
transport networks in the region’s economic corridors
and the implementation of cross-border transport agreement and trade facilitation measures. ADB organized
the 15th GMS Ministerial Conference in Thailand and
facilitated the Second Economic Corridors Forum in
Cambodia.

ADB and the ASEAN Secretariat discussed the review
of their memorandum of understanding and undertook a
strategic comparison of ADB’s programs in BIMP—EAGA
and the GMS with the ASEAN integration framework to
enhance synergies.

COUNTRY HIGHLIGHTS

Brunei Darussalam

Partnership priorities. Brunei Darussalam chaired the
BIMP—EAGA ministerial and senior officials meetings,
confirmed two connectivity projects between Brunei
Darussalam and Malaysia in the subregional priority
pipeline, and partnered with ADB to develop its finance
sector in pursuit of economic diversification and reduced
public sector dominance.

Impact of operations. ADB’s first reimbursable technical
assistance helped establish a strategy and action plan to
develop the country’s capital market. ADB collaborated
with Brunei Darussalam to determine follow-on technical
assistance on a reimbursable basis.

Cambodia

Partnership priorities. ADB’s country operations business plan 2009-2012 was fully aligned with the government’s 2008 Rectangular Strategy, Phase II. It aims to
achieve more inclusive, diversified economic growth
and greater poverty reduction through more targeted
interventions in agriculture and rural development;
private sector, governance, and capacity development;
and regional economic integration.

Impact of operations. The Emergency Food Assistance
Project continued to help 89,000 poor households cope
with food price hikes, and the cash-for-work program

Annual Report 2009 83

assisted 24,000 additional poor households in the Tonle
Sap Basin. The Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project expanded access to safe water and
sanitation, resulting in better health and greater convenience, especially for women and girls, and helping
achieve Cambodia’s Millennium Development Goals.

Indonesia

Partnership priorities. The country strategy and program for 2006—2009 was fully aligned with the government’s medium-term development plan, which aimed
to increase economic growth, create jobs, and accelerate
the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
ADb’s largest interventions focused on mitigating the
impact of the global economic crisis.

Impact of operations. ADB’s combined assistance of
$1.5 billion under the Public Expenditure Support
Facility and the Countercyclical Support Facility
helped maintain capital flows and financed a temporary fiscal expansion to protect social spending and
support poverty reduction programs. These facilities,
coupled with prudent macroeconomic management,
enabled Indonesia to weather the global financial crisis.
The Development Policy Support Program improved
the investment climate through a range of measures,
increased access to credit, strengthened public financial management and governance, and improved
public service delivery to the poorest sub-districts.

context. Priorities supported include agriculture, health,
education, and infrastructure which are core sectors in the
Sixth Five-Year National Socio-Economic Development
Plan, 2006-2010.

Impact of operations. During the first half of the
country strategy and program, income growth and poverty
reduction targets were surpassed, and the business
environment improved significantly. The Rural Financial Sector Development and Banking Sector Reform
programs strengthened the banking system and bank
oversight, recapitalized state banks, improved credit
quality, and significantly reduced the number of nonperforming loans. The entry of new private banks during
2007-2009 fostered competition and efficiency and
helped establish the banking system as the main credit
source for agriculture and small and medium-sized
enterprises.

Malaysia

Partnership priorities. Malaysia expanded its partnership with ADB under BIMP—EAGA and the IMT—
GT, contributing projects that form part of a fast-track
pipeline of priority infrastructure projects in the subregions. This demonstrated the country’s commitment

Cambodian Women: Improving Skills to Boost Income

At women’s development centers across
Cambodia, women learn to turn a profit by
using local materials to produce goods for
growing markets

 

Reap looks out onto verdant rice paddies. But life is not
as idyllic as it may seem in the luscious Cambodian countryside.

“It can be very tough to feed my four children, especially in
the rainy season,” Thav Heat, a widow, says. “When the harvest
season comes, we have food or rice to keep us going for just 5
months. But after that we have to earn money to buy food.”

Women across Cambodia face a similar challenge to make
the money they need, with husbands absent because of death,
divorce, or migration for work in other provinces or abroad.

Thav Heat and others earn extra money by weaving local grass into
mats and purses

 

While women are a mainstay of the informal economy, there
is little formal employment for them outside agriculture or the
garment factories in and around Phnom Penh.

“The problem is poverty—and access to opportunities,”
says Ing Kantha Phavi, the minister for women’s affairs. But
at new women's development centers, women like Thav Heat
are learning how to earn money and overcome a lack of skills.

Women's development centers, overseen by Ing Kantha
Phavi's ministry, and supported by partners, including ADB,
train women in life skills and entrepreneurship. They also facilitate access to microcredit.

This may have some impact on developing the informal
economy, which has received little attention from either the
government or international donors, according to the ministry.

The women’s development centers focus initially on enhancing existing skills and using locally available materials to
help clients improve their livelihoods.

The opening of a women’s development center in Leang
Dey, Siem Reap, gave Thav Heat the opportunity to learn not
only improved mat-weaving and design techniques but also
how to produce bags and purses for the growing tourism
market in Siem Reap.

“People used to spend up to 6 days making one mat—and
then they would sell it for $5. Lots of labor to make very little
money,” says Uch Sarom, a training adviser with the ministry.
“Now they can make $3-$4 a day depending on how fast they
work. We are teaching them marketing and design, and also
giving general business training.”

Her new skills mean that Thav Heat can stay close to home
while earning the extra money her family needs. Even the raw
material for the bags she makes, a grass known locally as romchek, grows right on her doorstep.

While vendors, most of whom are women, are not
charged rental for the stalls, they must first undergo training at the Women’s Resource Center, constructed with the
aid of a $1 million grant from ADB’s Japan Fund for Poverty
Reduction.

The center teaches poor women in Panabo City new
ways to increase their incomes, and helps them set up small
stores to sell their products. So far, it has trained more than
100 women, including Dolino. Training modules include
food processing for native delicacies, fruit processing, ice
cream making, and simple accounting and bookkeeping.
The center plans to train 1,600 poor women in the city.

Before she attended the Women’s Resource Center,
there were times when Dolino, 43, and her friends earned
so little money that they had to resort to asking the local
social welfare office for rice and dried fish to feed their families. Now, thanks to her training, Dolino earns extra income
by selling native delicacies that women at the center produce. “We now can earn $2 to $6 (P100 to P300) more
each day,” she says.

The Women’s Resource Center also operates a preschool where busy vendors can leave their children, knowing that they are safely learning nearby. In 2009, 37 students were enrolled.

The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction is financing the
construction of women’s resource centers in six other provinces in Mindanao.

NONSOVEREIGN
OPERATIONS

Amid challenging financial conditions in the wake of the global financial crisis,
nonsovereign operations came under increased due diligence to reduce risks. Private
sector projects approved in 2009 included a major boost to trade financing after
capital markets came to a standstill. ADB focuses on nonsovereign projects with
significant development impact, and its target is for half of total lending by 2020 to
support the development of a healthy private sector.DB’s nonsovereign operations are integral to

the objectives of Strategy 2020, which include a

target of 50% of ADB’s lending operations by 2020
in support of private sector development and private
sector operations. ADB focuses on nonsovereign projects
with significant development impact as well as on initiatives that stimulate the private sector and lead to accelerated, sustainable, and inclusive growth.

Annual Report 2009 89

The bulk of ADB’s nonsovereign operations emanate
from the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD).
In 2009, two nonsovereign public sector projects with total
financing of $190.5 million were processed by the South Asia
and East Asia Departments of ADB. PSOD assists developing member countries that may have limited access to
private capital by financing projects with significant
development impact. The assistance is provided through

 

Thawing the Big Credit Freeze

ADB dramatically stepped up assistance for trade
finance when banks hit by losses and writedowns
lost trust in each other and stopped lending

2009. Banks had lost confidence in each other and, as

concerns about the deepest recession since the 1930s
reverberated around the world, lenders were so averse to
risk that the once-vibrant trade finance network shut down.
Asia's export-dependent economies were caught between a
rock and a hard place.

Amid grave concern that the lack of trade finance would
impede economic recovery, ADB ramped up its $150 million
Trade Finance Facilitation Program to $1 billion. Through
the power of leveraging with partner banks, the program's
loans and guarantees on letters of credit for Asian exporters
supported $1.9 billion in trade last year—almost double the
target—with ADB exposure soaring 230% year on year. The
program is expected to help generate a further $13 billion of
trade by the end of 2013.

“Making it easier for companies to get hold of trade
finance should boost their business and encourage them
to expand and create jobs. This is critical to sustainable
long-term economic growth and to the poverty reduction
that goes along with it,’ said Robert van Zwieten, director

of ADB's Capital Markets and Financial Sectors Division, of
which the program is a part.

The 443 transactions supported last year amounted to
just under a quarter of the 1,650 that have received support
since the program started in 2004. Of the 443 transactions,
59% helped small and medium-sized enterprises—double
the average since inception—and half backed trade between
developing member countries. Ranging from as little as
$6,000 to $79 million, they supported exports as varied as
agricultural commodities, medicines, electrical goods, oil,
and a drilling rig.

Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Viet Nam occupied large
chunks of the portfolio. Other major markets included
Azerbaijan and Sri Lanka, and the program also operates in
Afghanistan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Nepal, and Tajikistan.

The number of issuing banks in 2009 increased from 50
at the start of the year to 73, while 89 banks that confirm
letters of credit for trading parties are now in the program
after 18 joined during the year. Negotiations are ongoing
with other banks as ADB targets an expansion of the program
in 2010, including an aggressive push into Central Asia.

The much-anticipated recovery in the global economy
is driving up trade volumes, particularly in Asia, and that
is spurring a blossoming in the demand for and supply of
the trade finance needed to fuel it. With ADB expecting
the economy of developing Asia to expand 6.6% this year,
against 1.6% growth in the United States and further likely
stagnation in the Eurozone, the Trade Finance Facilitation
Program will play a small but growing part of a brighter
future for the region.

ADB has set the standard for the construction of “good dams”

nonsovereign loans to private sector entities without
sovereign counterguarantees; equity investments; and
credit enhancement products, including guarantees and
B-loans (see Glossary), where ADB arranges a complete
financing package for a project with participation from local
and international commercial banks and other financial
institutions. Private entities seeking assistance from ADB
benefit not only from financial assistance but also from the
expertise and guidance of the ADB team. Assistance is
focused principally in the finance sector and in infrastructure.

In 2009, nonsovereign operations came under revised
due diligence guidelines and credit procedures, which
aimed to enhance the internal risk environment. Meanwhile, the external market environment continued to be
characterized by challenging economic and financial conditions in the wake of the global economic crisis. Against this
backdrop, the Board of Directors approved nine private
sector projects, and a major boost in scope and amount for the
‘Trade Finance Facilitation Program (TFFP). TFFP operates directly in response to the economic and financial
crisis and to the deterioration in trade and trade finance
specifically, and supports Strategy 2020’s regional integration agenda.

$1.9 billion, consisting of $443 million in direct loans,
$220 million in equity investments, $72 million in partial

to $92 million for 11 projects in 2009 (excluding TFFP).

Nonsovereign operations continue to support Strategy 2020’s three development agendas: inclusive economic
growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional
integration. In connection with environmentally sustainable growth, five projects were in the area of renewable
energy, at a cost of $426 million and representing 23%
of approvals. Other approvals consisted of a $200 million
waste management project representing 11%, a $120
million conventional energy project accounting for 6% of
overall operations, TFFP representing 46%, three finance
sector projects representing 13%, and one project in telecommunications (1%).

ADB’s nonsovereign operations focused on two of
the core areas of operations identified in Strategy 2020:
infrastructure (with particular emphasis on energy) and
finance. Strategic interventions through public—private
partnerships focused on renewable energy and other
infrastructure sectors. For example, ADB agreed to
invest $40 million in a new public-private joint venture
company that will develop, construct, and operate a
portfolio of renewable energy projects in India, with
an initial focus on wind power and small-scale hydroelectric power (see Boosting India’s Wind Power,
p. 91). ADB finances commercially viable infrastructure
projects that are structured or capable of being structured as public-private partnerships. An example is

ith their 73-meter “stalks” and 26-meter “petals,”
WW the wind turbines look from afar like giant plants

sprouting from the landscape in a remote corner
of India’s Maharashtra state. From isolated locations like this,
the turbines feed nearly 80 megawatts of electricity—enough
to power several thousand households—into the state grid.

Like most rural areas in energy-starved India, where during
peak hours demand outstrips supply by some 20%, villages in
Maharashtra commonly experience power outages of up to
12 hours a day. Without electricity, the villagers are virtually
cut off from the outside world.

Tata Power is one of the major power utilities working to
expand generation capacity to help make the nation’s power
supply more reliable. Encouraged by a loan from the private
sector operations of ADB, which supports the government's

infrastructure financing facility company and a public
sector loan of $100 million to a fully government-owned
holding company, which will in turn relend the entire
amount to the financing facility company.

Nonsovereign projects were administered in 23
developing member countries, including ADB’s first
private sector intervention in Papua New Guinea, which
was approved, signed, and disbursed in 2009.

COFINANCING

ADB’s private sector policy restricts direct project
funding to 25% of the total cost. However, in exceptional
circumstances, ADB will directly support a higher

drive to provide more reliable power supply and transition
India to a low-carbon economy, Tata Power has become
India’s largest private power player in wind energy, with a
capacity of 200 megawatts, and it plans to continue to be a
leading player in wind energy by developing more wind farms.

The company borrowed about $65 million (Rs3 billion)
from ADB (including cofinancing arranged by ADB). The 13year loan helped the company fix its borrowing costs and
avoid the risk rising interest rates might have on its wind power
investments at Khandke in Ahmednagar district, Bramanvel in
Dhulia district, and Sadawaghapur in Satara district.

The government's goal of “Power for All by 2012”
requires renewable sources—solar, biomass, small hydro,
and wind—to be developed. In Maharashtra, the state
government is adopting a carrot-and-stick approach. It
pays a higher rate for wind energy but requires power
distributors to procure at least 6% of their input to the
state grid from renewable energy sources by 2010, or face
penalties. However, wind technology is still relatively costly
and remains unattractive to some commercial enterprises.

Through its Carbon Market Initiative—a financing
scheme that helps developing countries tap the global carbon
market—ADB is also helping the Khandke project qualify as
a Clean Development Mechanism project under the Kyoto
Protocol. Under this mechanism, ADB is prepared to provide
up-front financing by purchasing up to 50% of Tata Power's
anticipated certified emission reductions. These payments will
add significantly to the company’s earnings from electricity sales.

Life for India’s large rural population will improve hugely
with greater access to electricity. Meanwhile, Tata Power
expects to benefit both from lessons learned and cost
reductions from advances in turbine technology as it expands
its wind power investments.

percentage of the overall financing for small transactions
with a very high development impact. Given this overall
lending restriction for the private sector, cofinancing is
an important instrument for ADB to enhance support
for the private sector. ADB has various guarantee and
cofinancing products, and demand for them has increased
substantially of late, particularly since the recent
financial market turmoil. In this regard, PSOD will
continue to build close and collaborative relationships
with the financial community, thereby enhancing the
opportunities to avail of these products.

ADB applied its cofinancing instruments to mobilize
cofinancing with several partners, catalyzing $220 million
of direct new money for developing member countries for
two projects with an aggregate cost of $2.2 billion.

FINANCE AND
ADMINISTRATION

Our People Strategy was prepared to help ADB recruit, retain, manage, and develop
the human resources needed under Strategy 2020. Staff members’ management and
technical skills were upgraded. Business processes were streamlined.HUMAN RESOURCES

Improving human resource management. ADB
formulated the Human Resources Action Plan (20092010) based on the results of two initiatives carried out
in 2008: the comprehensive review of ADB’s human
resources strategy (2005-2007) and the staff engagement
survey. A priority initiative of the plan was to prepare a
human resources strategy to guide the recruitment,
retention, management, and development of the workforce required to implement Strategy 2020. ADB accomplished this goal by preparing Our People Strategy, which
will guide human resources management through 2015.

Workforce planning exercise. To ensure that resources
will be adequate to implement Strategy 2020 and that
ADB operations can sustain quality at the levels supported
by the ninth replenishment of the Asian Development
Fund and the fifth general capital increase, the Budget,
Personnel, and Management Systems Department
undertook a workforce planning exercise. The exercise
comprised a review of workforce requirements to identify
gaps in staff head count, allocation, and skills mix, and an
institutional review of strategic areas.

Staff development. ADB reprioritized staff development programs to ensure that ADB will have the staff skills
needed to implement its operational programs. The development programs emphasize team-based leadership development and sector and thematic programs to support
Strategy 2020. As a result, staff members at headquarters
and field offices were offered 152 training programs. In all,
4,668 staff members participated in 509 learning sessions.

STAFFING

Additional staffing requirements in 2010-2012. The
results of the workforce planning exercise indicated that
ADB will need 500 more staff positions to implement
Strategy 2020: about a 20% increase in staff strength over
the 2009 level by 2012, and a total increase of 90 professional staff, 86 national officers, and 74 administrative
staff positions in 2010.

2009 staffing. As of 31 December 2009, ADB’s staff
strength totaled 2,602 from 58 of its 67 members:

Annual Report 2009 93

5 members of Management, and 927 professional and 1,670
local staff members, of whom 523 or about 20.1% were in
field offices. Appointments and departures numbered 119
and 66 among professional staff, and 154 and 109 among
local staff. Women accounted for 27.8% of all professional
staff.

New position and staff management systems. ADB
improved its systems for managing various aspects of
staffing, including the distribution of staff among ADB’s
job levels.

Organizational realignments. In response to the
changing environment in which it operates, ADB undertook a number of institutional realignments: it raised the
institutional credit risk management unit to the level of
an office; established the Office of Anticorruption and
Integrity; created the Unit for Institutional Coordination
within the Budget, Personnel, and Management Systems
Department; and consolidated its human resources
function into two divisions.

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

The Board of Directors approved a 1.8% weighted
average increase in ADB’s overall salary structure and a
3.4% salary increase for professional staff in 2010. This
increase was in addition to the budget of $1.6 million
allocated for performance bonuses. For national officers and the administrative staff at ADB headquarters,
the Board approved a 2.7% weighted average increase
in salary structure, and a 6.9% salary increase in 2010.
Management approved a new salary structure for national
officers and administrative staff working at ADB’s field
offices, with salary increases ranging from 0.5% to 17.7%.
Salary increases are effective 1 January 2010 and apply
to the midpoint salary level within each staff pay grade.

Staff members at headquarters
and field offices were offered
152 training programs in 2009.
In all, 4,668 staff members
participated in 509 learning
sessions

The Board also approved lowering the vesting period
from 10 to 5 years for staff retirement plan participants who
were hired on or after 1 October 2006. This change is effective as of 1 January 2010 and is retroactive for participants
hired on or after 1 October 2006. Thus, staff retirement
plan participants who have met the 5-year service requirement are eligible for a pension. For service of less than
5 years, participants will receive a lump-sum withdrawal
benefit upon termination of employment.

ADB also upgraded its relocation package and field
office benefits for professional staff members assigned to
field offices so that they remain competitive with other
international financial institutions, especially in non-family
and hardship duty stations, effective 1 June 2009.

influenza A (H1N1). Although the systems are no longer
active, the team can reactivate them as necessary.

INTERNAL ADMINISTRATIVE
EXPENSES

Internal administrative expenses totaled $379.0 million,
compared to the net internal administrative budget of
$388.9 million. Of the total savings of $9.9 million, about
2% of the 2009 internal administrative expenses budget
amounting to $7.7 million is being carried forward to
2010. The overruns in certain budget items in the operational and administrative budget categories were fully
met through reallocations within the same budget categories. The savings were mainly attributable to staff vacancies and lower-than-budgeted use for relocation, business
travel, office occupancy, and contractual services. These
savings were partly offset by overruns in staff benefits,
because of additional contribution to the staff retirement
fund to meet increasing funding requirements, and in
depreciation, primarily because of completion of certain
information technology projects under the Information
System and Technology Strategy, Phase II, for which
depreciation began in 2009.

For 2010, the net internal administrative expenses
budget is $439.5 million, including the budget for the
Independent Evaluation Department of $8.4 million. The
increase of $50.6 million, or 13% over the 2009 budget,
reflects a price increase of 5% and a volume growth of 8%.

funds of multilateral and bilateral institutions.

In addition to internal administrative expenses,
the 2010 budget includes an annual capital budget of
$6.5 million, mainly to fund cyclical capital expenditures
for headquarters and field offices, and security and safetyrelated expenditures.

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES

‘The Office of Administrative Services (OAS) continued
to improve overall service delivery, and focused on
equipping staff with upgraded management and technical skills.

In May, OAS and the Regional and Sustainable
Development Department jointly prepared the second
sustainability report. OAS obtained ISO (International
Organization for Standardization) 14001 and OSHAS
(Occupational Safety and Health Assessment Series)
18001 recertification as part of its environmental health
and safety management system. OAS also undertook an
energy audit and launched green procurement guidelines,
these activities being steps in obtaining Leadership in
Energy and Environmental Design, or green building
certification.

OAS improved the microfilming process, streamlined
communication and transport services, automated
information technology inventory management, and
performed an as-is business process mapping exercise
to determine which of OAS business processes could
be further streamlined, automated, or otherwise made
more efficient. OAS launched eTrip, a web-based online
travel-planning facility, introduced new multifunctional

printers, and rationalized the use of supplies. The role
of the iLink information coordinators was strengthened,
and the iLink Digest, a monthly bulletin of excerpts
of sector-specific research, was launched. Finally, in
October, eStar, the electronic repository system, celebrated its first anniversary and, by the end of the year,
contained more than 200,000 documents.

OAS adopted a pandemic crisis management plan
for meeting health emergencies and demonstrated a
high level of emergency response preparedness during
several typhoons.

OAS support to resident missions focused on office
building, property, and vehicle insurance, safety, and security. Administrative policies affecting staff members posted
to field offices were likewise streamlined. OAS continued
its headquarters rehabilitation program by constructing a
covered walkway and upgrading the cafeteria and kitchen.
Approval to build the third atrium and a car park to meet
expected space requirements was also obtained.

The OAS events management unit organized more
than 120 events since its inception in July 2008.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AND TECHNOLOGY

During 2009, the Office of Information Systems and
Technology (OIST) continued to implement application systems, and improve the ADB network, information technology (IT) processes, and governance. It also

passed the halfway mark in implementing the Information
Systems and Technology Strategy II (ISTS I).

As part of implementing ISTS II and Strategy 2020,
OIST completed several IT infrastructure projects
during the year. These included upgrading ADB’s
e-mail service, payment gateway, data storage system,
mainframe operating system, Oracle Enterprise Resource
Planning platform, and infrastructure for the enterprise
portal. Network bandwidth was likewise optimized to
improve resident mission connectivity.

OIST also focused on sustaining internal control
over financial reporting. Security measures were tightened for resident mission servers and the ADB network,
including more powerful antivirus software for all
personal computers. Web application security software
was procured to assess vulnerabilities in ADB’s online
systems. Disaster recovery tests were conducted regularly, and remote access was provided for staff performing
critical payment functions.

Integrated business processes and access by staff to
appropriate information were also key priorities. Business
process modeling was introduced as a part of enterprise
architecture initiatives for managing ADB’s business
processes in a single repository.

The Operations Dashboard was
launched to provide operations
departments with a “one-stop
shop” for online reports

Recruitment and staff management were automated. The accounting applications for 24 resident missions
and payroll applications for 14 field offices were improved,
paving the way for seamless integration of practices at resident missions and headquarters.

Collaboration technology solutions were given high
priority, with ADB’s first document repository system,
eStar, being completed.

Several projects captured business process information. The Operations Dashboard was launched to provide
operations departments with a “one-stop shop” for online
reports. The results management system was introduced.
Consultant procurement and business travel processes
were progressively automated, and a fund management
system for the Treasury Department was completed.

OIST continued to help users transition to new IT
systems by conducting training workshops at headquarters and field offices, and it established an improved
engagement model for handling business requests.

LOAN, GRANT, AND TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE DISBURSEMENTS

The Controller’s Department (CTL) continued to
improve its services. The business processes for loan,
grant, and technical assistance disbursements were
reviewed and streamlined, resulting in notable efficiency gains. CTL introduced a process of monitoring
its disbursement performance against set benchmarks.
The introduction of service level standards significantly
increased CTL’s disbursement efficiency, resulting in
an 8.2% decrease in the overall disbursement processing
time (inclusive of time spent with the borrowers,
executing agencies, operations departments, and resident missions) from the year before, despite an increase
of 15.5% in transaction volume.

By the end of the year, the disbursement processing
function for loans had been delegated to seven resident
missions. Seven other remote resident missions with
a smaller portfolio also assisted in the initial review of
borrowers’ disbursement requests, and helped expedite
disbursement through electronic submission of withdrawal applications from the resident mission directly
to CTL. The increased role of the resident missions in
disbursement improved communication with borrowers
and executing agencies.CTL strengthened its commitment to help build
the capacity of developing member country borrowers
and executing agencies, and of disbursement staff at the
resident missions. CTL conducted 36 disbursement and
loan accounting training seminars for over 1,000 borrowers
and executing agency officials, and conducted consultative meetings with the regional departments to better
understand their needs and improve coordination.

CT Ldeveloped a financial tool for loan accounting and
servicing (eC-LAS) to help borrowers, executing agencies,
and ADB project teams process and administer loans. CTL
started distributing the eC-LAS and training users in the
People’s Republic of China, Pakistan, the Philippines, and
Uzbekistan. CTL translated the eC-LAS into Chinese and
started the Russian version. In addition toa website on loan
disbursements, CTL started developing a website on loan
accounting and servicing for borrowers, executing agencies,
ADB staff, and other organizations concerned.

FINANCIAL REPORTING

CTLrevised its accounting policies, especially with regard
to market valuation of financial instruments. CTL also
started a preliminary study on the International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS), considering a possible transition to IFRS from the United States generally accepted
accounting principles (US GAAP)-based standards. CTL,

The increased role of the resident
missions in disbursement improved
communication with borrowers and
executing agencies

together with the staff development group, strengthened
staff training on IFRS.

CTL facilitated Management’s assertion and the
external auditor’s attestation on internal controls for
financial reporting, which ADB started in fiscal year
2008, for better corporate governance. The assertion and
attestation for fiscal year 2009 was accomplished with an
unqualified opinion from the external auditor, Deloitte
& Touche. This initiative strengthened staff awareness
of internal controls. Training on internal controls, risk
assessments, and testing skills was strengthened.

CTL, with the assistance of OIST, implemented the
financial and management accounting system for resident
missions to improve work efficiency, data reliability, and
internal controls. As of 31 December, 24 of the 27 resident
missions and regional offices were using the system. CTL
provided accounting support for new trust funds, including
the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund, the Future Carbon Fund, the
Financing Partnership Facilities, and the Climate Change
Fund, to ensure that ADB meets its fiduciary responsibility
as the custodian of the funds it administers.

GLOSSARY

B-loan. A tranche of a direct loan nominally advanced by
ADB, subject to eligible financial institutions’ taking funded risk participations within such a tranche and without
recourse to ADB. It complements an A-loan funded by
ADB.

Direct value-added cofinancing. Cofinancing with active
coordination and formal agreements among financing
partners that bring about defined client benefits, including contractual commitments by ADB (such as for credit
enhancement, syndication, or financial administration) to
facilitate mobilization, administration, or participation in
cofinancing.

Multitranche financing facility. A debt-financing facility
to target discrete, sequential components of large standalone projects; slices (or tranches) of sector investment
programs over a longer time frame than the current norm;
financial intermediary credit lines; and guarantees.

Sovereign, nonsovereign. ADB lending is classified as
sovereign or nonsovereign. A sovereign loan is guaranteed
by the national government, while a nonsovereign loan is
not guaranteed by the national government.

Nonsovereign operations. Refer to an ADB-financed
transaction with a subsovereign, state-owned enterprise,
other public private entity, or private sector entity as obligor or investee, normally without direct sovereign indemnity.

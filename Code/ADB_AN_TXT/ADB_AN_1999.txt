REPORT

Chino at the
Manila Social
Forum

An Asia Without Poverty

Message from the Chairman of the Board of Directors

sia and the Pacific have made
tremendous economic and social
gains over the past three decades.
Per capita income has tripled. Average life expectancy at birth
in the early 1970s was
48 years; now it's 65 years.
Then, only 40 percent of
the population could read
and write; today, 70 percent of the region's adults
are literate.

These three decades
of unprecedented economic growth and improvement in the standard
of living have witnessed a
decline in the proportion
of Asians in poverty. Nevertheless, Asia is still
home to the poor—two thirds of the world’s poor
live in Asia. South Asia alone has more than
500 million poverty-stricken people, almost
twice as many as in the whole of Africa.

The 1997 financial crisis has worsened the
situation by stalling decades of development
and dragging millions of people back into
poverty. Although the crisis has passed, the
social aftershocks continue to be felt. Millions
have lost their jobs and cannot find work.
Women, children, the disabled, and the elderly
are suffering most. Many are malnourished;
more are prone to illness. Many children—girls
in particular—have dropped out of school.

But the financial crisis has given us a
chance to rectify the weaknesses and strengthen
Asia’s economies. By propelling poverty and
suffering into the headlines, our attention has
been drawn to the huge underclass that has
been essentially untouched by the economic
development of the past three decades. Many
of us had become too complacent. Now is the
time to harness our collective creativity, energy,
and resources in the battle against poverty.

For ADB, a poverty-free region is not mere
rhetoric. Reducing poverty in Asia has always
been one of ADB's fundamental aims. Now, ADB
has rededicated itself to the fight: it has made
poverty reduction its overarching goal rather
than just one of five strategic objectives.

ADB believes the most powerful weapons
in the fight against poverty are pro-poor,
sustainable economic growth, social development, and good governance. These are the three
pillars on which ADB's poverty reduction strategy is built.

This single-mindedness of approach is
radically changing how ADB does business,
with all ADB staff members making poverty
reduction their priority.

Starting this year, an annual ADB action
plan for poverty reduction will be prepared, and
country partnership agreements will be developed. ADB's commitment is that at least 40 percent of its lending volume by 2001 will be
devoted to poverty interventions.

All projects will have to show that they
benefit the poor, directly or indirectly. In this
Annual Report, you will find many illustrations
of the ways in which ADB is already immersed
in this work—by encouraging private sector
development, strengthening management in
the public sector, promoting good governance, improving the status of women, protecting the environment, and promoting
regional cooperation.

ADB supports the international and regional development targets established at summits in the 1990s, including the Strategy 21 goal
of reducing by half the proportion of people in
absolute poverty by 2015.

Bringing the vision of a poverty-free region
to reality requires stronger partnerships
between developed and developing countries.
One such partnership is the Asian Development
Fund (ADF), the only multilateral source of
concessional assistance exclusively for theregion. More than half of the ADF lending supports projects with explicit environmental and
social objectives. But the ADF resource will be
exhausted within this year: its funds are urgently
in need of replenishment.

Of course, our developing member countries themselves have the primary responsibility
for fighting poverty. We will help them in every
way we can, but success requires cooperation
and partnership, not only with and between
governments, but also with nongovernment
organizations, funding agencies, the private sector, and—critically—the people of Asia.

Although the crisis-hit economies are
showing signs of revival and the economic
prognosis is positive, much work needs to be
done to ensure that gains
are sustained. We have
long known that growth
can reduce poverty by
generating employment
and incomes. We know,
too, that pro-poor growth
can reduce it even faster.
We have learned much
from recent experience in
East Asia.

We recognize that
human development is
the key to economic development. This means
a proper balance between
the economic and social
agendas. It means ensuring adequate nutrition,
health care, and education. It means investing
in social capital and creating the right policy
environment for those
investments.

In a world so rich in
resources and brilliant

minds, it is unacceptable that deprivation and
destitution should still plague so many of the
world's people, as has happened in many
countries in the 20" century. Asia and the
Pacific can be free of poverty. But this requires
continued strong international commitment to
this task.

ADB has a Clear vision of a poverty-free
region. To achieve our vision will never be
easy. But, I am convinced that with close cooperation with all our development partners,
we together can free Asia and the Pacific from
poverty, and make the region a better place
where all people can live with dignity and
hope.

Board of Directors’ Report

n 1999, the Asian Development Bank (ADB)

worked in a far brighter Asian economic

environment than had been expected.

Economic indicators mostly moved favorably, and confidence grew that the unprecedented events of 1997-1998 had been left
behind. Most of ADB's developing member
countries (DMCs) had better growth rates in
1999 than in 1998 and higher than forecast.
Some progress was made in the necessary
restructuring and reform of banks, capital
markets, and regulatory regimes in the main
crisis-affected countries, but financial recovery
has largely preceded reform.

Although markets recovered, the social
costs of the crisis continued to mount in 1999,
with aftershocks being felt throughout the year
and millions of people in the region being
thrown back into poverty. ADB responded in a
fundamental way to the year's harsh reminders
of the poor's fragile hold on economic wellbeing and the weakness of the region's social
safety nets: by rededicating itself to the goal of
eliminating poverty from the region.

Poverty reduction strategy

In adopting the poverty reduction strategy, the
Board of Directors ensured the primacy of the
attack on poverty in ADB's work. Its other strategic objectives—promoting economic growth,
developing human resources, improving the
status of women, and protecting the environment—will still be pursued, but in ways that
serve to enhance poverty reduction: So, too, will
ADB's encouragement of the private sector and
its support of regional development initiatives.

To implement this pro-poor strategy, the
Poverty Reduction Unit was created in an
upgraded Strategy and Policy Department. A
Presidential Commission on Poverty Reduction

was formed, comprising the heads of key
departments and offices. The Regional
Economic Monitoring Unit and the Asia
Recovery Information Center, both established
in 1999, expanded ADB's efforts to monitor the
impact of the crisis and the pattern of recovery.

Policy developments

Within the framework of the emerging pro-poor
orientation of ADB, the Board of Directors in
1999 approved several major policy initiatives
designed to broaden the development impact
of ADB's work in its DMCs. In addition to the
poverty reduction strategy, the Board of
Directors approved a health sector policy,
began reviews of the private sector strategy
and ADB's resident missions, assessed ADB's
program and guarantee operations, and
examined its sector lending.

In the health sector, the Board of Directors
approved a policy that focuses ADB clearly on
improving primary health care for the poor,
women, and indigenous peoples. It reaffirmed
that the overall approach is to assist DMC
governments in ensuring broad access to
basic primary health care that is cost-effective
and affordable.

The review of the private sector strategy
entails assessing an important premise: that the
growth of the private sector and the extent of
poverty are inversely related. The review of the
resident missions is being undertaken to ensure
that they provide value for money. Both reviews
will be completed in 2000.

The review of program lending identified
gaps in both the policy framework and
implementation. As a result, two new program
lending modalities were created: a special
program loan (SPL) that can provide, on an
exceptional basis, large-scale support as part

of an international rescue
package to crisis-affected
countries eligible for ordinary
capital resources (OCR), and
a cluster approach that can
enhance flexibility and
extend the time frame for
program implementation.
The former policy initiative
allows higher pricing of SPLs
to protect ADB's financial
strength and risk-bearing
capacity and exemption of
SPLs from the regular
program lending ceiling. The
Board of Directors also
approved a higher ceiling on
total regular program lending: 20 percent of total ADB public sector
lending rather than 15 percent.

The review of ADB's guarantee operations,
since they were introduced in 1988, confirmed
that they are an important instrument that can
mobilize resources to support DMC reform
programs and catalyze private financing for
infrastructure projects. The Board of Directors
recommended and changed certain key provisions in the current policy involving discount
rates, country eligibility, mainstreaming of
guarantees, staff training, technical assistance,
and the Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility
guarantees to ensure the instrument's continued usefulness and flexibility.

The Boards and Their Functions

DB is governed by a Board of Governors,

which, at the end of 1999, consisted of 58 members (42 regional and 16 nonregional). Under Article
28 of ADB’s Charter, the Board of Governors is vested
with all the powers of ADB. In turn, the Governors
delegate their authority to the Board of Directors,
except for certain powers reserved to them under

Ram @ar late

The Board of Governors meets formally once a
year for ADB’s Annual Meeting. The resolutions
approved by the Board of Governors in 1999 and
its membership are shown in Appendixes 1 and 2.

Also under Article 28, the Board of Governors
elects a 12-member Board of Directors, eight

 

As for sector lending, the Board of Directors
noted some occasional shortcomings in focus but
concluded that addressing them required no
changes in ADB policies and procedures. Rather,
the need is for more dedicated attention to DMC
policy frameworks and institutional capacities,
keeping in mind that the sector loan is best used
in the overall context of ADB assistance.

General operations

The Board of Directors met formally on
59 occasions, including executive sessions, and
held 18 informal discussions and 4 informal
seminars during the year. During the formal
meetings, the Directors approved $5 billion for
66 loans for 52 projects. Of this, $4 billion was
from ADB's OCR and $1 billion from the Asian
Development Fund (ADF). Nearly 40 percent
of project approvals by the Board of Directors,
excluding private sector and technical
assistance loans, had poverty reduction as
their primary or secondary objective. In
addition to loans, the Board of Directors,
either directly or through the delegated
authority vested in the President by the Board,
approved 315 technical assistance grants
amounting to $173 million.

During the informal discussions, the
Directors examined a broad agenda of items,
including ADB's resource position, investment
strategy and investment authority, three-year

elected by regional members and four by
nonregional members (see Appendix 3). Each
Director appoints an Alternate. The President of
ADB is the Chairperson of the Board of Directors.

The Board of Directors performs its duties
on a full-time basis at ADB’s headquarters in
Manila, Philippines, and meets in regular formal
and executive sessions. The Directors exercise
their authority and functions through their
supervision of ADB’s financial statements, their
approval of ADB’s administrative budget, and
their continuous review and approval of policy
documents and all loan, equity, and technical
assistance operations.1999 in Review: Board of Directors’ Report

 

rolling work program and budget framework,
operations in East Timor, and country assistance plans for 2000-2002. During the
informal seminars, the Directors examined
advance procurement action, retroactive
financing, and various country operational
strategy studies.

The 324 Annual Meeting of the Board of
Governors was held in Manila, Philippines, from
29 April to 2 May 1999.

Azerbaijan joined ADB in 1999, bringing ADB's

Board committees
Audit Committee

In its 1998-1999 report to the Board of
Directors, the Audit Committee continued to
emphasize the importance of good governance,
accountability, and transparency in all aspects
of ADB operations, and also the need for
objective monitoring and evaluation of ADB's
portfolio performance and prompt implementation of audit recommendations.

The Committee held 17 formal meetings in
1999 and several informal meetings. It reviewed
ADB's draft Financial Statements for 1998 with

the external auditors (PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP) and recommended to the
President that the draft Financial Statements
for 1998 be approved by the Board of Governors.
It recommended that reviews be undertaken of
loan-loss provisioning and the delineation of
the ADF and OCR policies. It also endorsed
ADB's approach to accounting for costs incurred
by the ADB Institute.

The Committee noted the achievements of
the Office of the General Auditor (OGA) and
endorsed its work program for 1999. It
requested that target dates for deferred audit
recommendations be provided and a mechanism be set up to ensure implementation of
recommendations. It also endorsed the work
program of the Operations Evaluation Office
(OEO).

The Committee reviewed in detail four
project performance audit reports, two impact
evaluation studies, and three special studies. It
cited the special studies on road facilities and
the country assistance program evaluation and
recommended that similar studies be included
in OEO's work program for 2000.

The Committee noted the close coordination between the evaluation units of
multilateral finance institutions (MFIs) and
recommended harmonization of ADB's project
performance ratings with those of other MFIs.
It drew attention to the outstanding issues
of systems not supported by the Office of
Information Systems and Technology, and

systems used by DMCs and other institutions
that link up with ADB's computer systems. It
also noted that the final cost to ADB of
complying with year 2000 requirements was
within the regular maintenance budget. It recommended an interdepartmental review to consider the selection evaluation of consultants to
increase transparency.

The Committee reviewed its own terms of
reference, taking into account the comments
of the General Auditor and the advice of the
independent auditors. It recommended an
update in its terms of reference, including
greater clarification of its responsibilities, and
its recommendations were adopted.

The membership of the Audit Committee
is shown in Appendix 4.

Budget Review Committee

The Budget Review Committee was convened
in November 1999 to review ADB's operations
during the year and Management's budget proposal for 2000. It discussed the work achievements for 1999 and the work plans for 2000 of
ADB's departments and offices, and of the ADB
Institute. It concluded that ADB uses its
resources efficiently.

The Committee recognized that the longterm strategic framework will need to incorporate poverty reduction as ADB's main objective
and that increased consultation with member
countries would sharpen ADB's vision. New
approaches for implementing the pro-poor
strategy will be required, and the aim should

be achievable program and lending targets with
clear, practical poverty interventions.

The Committee also said country
programming should reflect the priorities
emerging from the poverty analysis, the highlevel forum, and the partnership agreements
between DMCs and ADB. It noted that the
country assistance plans will translate partnership agreements into specific programs of
loan and technical assistance projects. It
stressed the need to implement the poverty
reduction strategy with clear country foci. The
Committee noted that collaboration with
other MFIs and the International Monetary
Fund would be useful in shaping ADB's future
role in poverty reduction. It appreciated the
concerted media campaign to publicize the
poverty reduction strategy.

The Committee also noted ADB's increased
emphasis on corporate governance and anticorruption, with the establishment of the new
Anticorruption Unit, and OGA's continued efforts
in promoting internal governance through
training materials and fraud awareness seminars. It noted the recent task force approval of
measures for implementing the anticorruption
policy and for dealing with allegations of fraud
and corruption. It appreciated the efforts to
update ADB's guidelines for procurement and
guidelines on the use of consultants to
incorporate anticorruption provisions.

The Committee reviewed ADB's resources
and recommended that key financial indicators be updated. It emphasized the importance of prudent management of cash and

on ADB's income when the new Investment
Authority and strategy becomes operational
by the end of 2000. It noted that the implementation of the treasury risk management
software was scheduled for early 2001. It welcomed the review of OCR loan products and
suggested that new products would need to
support the poverty reduction strategy.

The Committee noted the effective use of
budget resources. It noted, too, ADB's
continuing efforts to redeploy staff, resulting
in the identification of 19 positions for
redeployment and the provision of 30 new
positions.

Board Inspection Committee

 

The Committee dealt with one request, a second request for review of the Korangi Wastewater Management Project in Pakistan, but from
a different organization.

A review of the inspection function, started
in 1998, continued in 1999, and a working paper
was discussed by the Board of Directors in
September 1999. The central issue was whether
the inspection policy should be applied to ADB's
private sector operations.

The Committee welcomed the continuing
efforts of the inspection function to improve its
outreach, including the intention to appoint an
additional staff member.

Directors' visits

The Directors made three visits to DMCs in 1999:
the first to Fiji Islands, Samoa, and Vanuatu
from 20 February to 6 March; the second to
Palawan, Philippines from 13 to 16 May; and
the third to the People’s Republic of China (PRC)
and Mongolia from 27 August to 12 September.
During the first and third visits, the Directors
held wide-ranging policy discussions with government ministers and senior officials and inspected several ADB-financed projects. The visit
to Palawan provided the Directors with an
appreciation of the planning process of local

procedures can be found in ADB's Inspection government authorities, the experiences of we

Emerging global water issues
The looming water crisis

arth is the blue planet with water one of

the most plentiful natural substances in

its environment. There is more than

1.4 billion cubic kilometers (km?) of the
stuff—enough to give every man, woman, and
child more than 230 million cubic meters (m°)
each if we were to divide it evenly.

However, more than 98 percent of the
world's water is salt water and we depend for
our basic vital needs on freshwater. Most freshwater is locked in the polar ice caps. Less than
1 percent of the earth's freshwater is accessible
in lakes, rivers, and groundwater aquifers. That
vital 1 percent of available freshwater is constantly in motion, either flowing in rivers, evaporating and moving around the globe as water
vapor, falling from the sky as rain or snow, or
filtering slowly through the earth to emerge
somewhere else. It is a renewable resource on
which we all completely depend. It is the genesis and continuing source of all life on earth.

The most accessible water is that which
flows in river channels or is stored in freshwater
lakes and reservoirs. The major portion of the
water diverted for human needs is taken from
this renewable, readily accessible part of the
world's freshwater resources. Although the total
volume of water conveyed annually by the
world's rivers is about 43,000 km° (see figure),
most of this occurs as floods—the low river
flows (base flows) make up only about
19,000 km?.! Of this, about 12,500 km? can be
accessed, and present levels of withdrawal

 

account for about 4,000 km*. Withdrawals are
anticipated to reach 5,500 km* per year by 2025.

The demand for freshwater increased sixfold between 1900 and 1995, twice the rate of
population growth.? The 1997 United Nations
(UN) Comprehensive Assessment of Freshwater
Resources of the World concluded that one third
of the world's population today already live in
countries experiencing medium to high water
stress. High water stress and unsustainable
rates of withdrawal are already being experienced in Central and South Asia, where annual
water withdrawals compared with available
water resources are 50 percent or more. The
northern People’s Republic of China (PRC) and
Mongolia have medium stress conditions with
25 percent water use. Although water stress (see
box on page 8) computes at less than 10 percent in Southeast Asia (including southern PRC)

and the Pacific and is therefore considered to
be low, this measure is highly distorted by seasonally high river flows. In the dry season, water
scarcity occurs throughout Asia and the Pacific,
and increased rainfall variability as a result of
global climate change will worsen this problem. Water scarcity will affect food security
throughout Asia and the Pacific.

The global population will expand from
today's 6 billion people to almost 8 billion in
2025. By then, more than 80 percent of the
world's population will be living in developing
countries. The World Meteorological Organization estimates, assuming the renewable water
resources will remain unchanged, that the
number of countries facing water stress will
increase from 29 today to 34 in 2025. How these
countries manage their water resources, and
whether they can produce sufficient food for
their growing populations while catering to their
water needs and preserving natural environments, have important implications—and
imperatives—for the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) and its developing member countries
(DMCs). ADB has been extensively involved in
planning, formulating, and financing water
resource projects in its DMCs, and has accumulated valuable experience that must be used
to respond proactively to the challenge. The
poverty reduction strategy adopted in 1999
enjoins ADB, at the policy level, to continue to
support governments in developing, in a participatory manner, master plans for effective
management of critical natural resources,
including water.

Competition for water is increasing among
different water uses, including water for ecological needs. In many DMCs, irregular and

ater stress for a river basin is defined in
Colle letMelm-TA AUN CLUS (Url PRI Ccle
withdrawn from a surface or groundwater source
for human purposes) as a percentage of the total

MEN eclamcctsele cecc Me NVlIE-1°) (Mam dat-] em ede C TAMIA Calg
ic COLME CCl eam CMU itl eM meD ml Clg
stress for all its river basins. Water stress begins
when withdrawals of freshwater rise above

inequitably distributed supplies of piped water
have a detrimental effect on the social and
economic well-being of most of their citizens.
Ironically, consumers in almost all DMCs are
charged less for their water than it costs to
provide. Hence, utilities are reluctant to connect
new customers because water prices are too low
to allow them to recoup their investment. For the
poor, access to even a rudimentary level of municipal water supply is frequently denied, and they
may be constrained to use untreated water from
highly unreliable sources. Waterborne diseases are
causing immense suffering and loss of productivity, with the poor suffering disproportionately. Large cities in Asia are not equipped to
offer their burgeoning populations the water
supply and sanitation services they require.

Nearly 70 percent of global freshwater withdrawals are directed toward agriculture, mainly
for irrigation. By some estimates (UN 1997),
annual irrigation water use will have to increase
about 30 percent above present use for annual
crop production to double and meet global food
requirements by 2025. Although irrigation will
remain the dominant water use in developing
countries, an increase of 30 percent in irrigation
withdrawals may not be possible if other
essential human needs are to be met. Making
irrigation more efficient will be necessary and
unavoidable. The industry sector, which
accounts for about 22 percent of current freshwater withdrawals globally, is likely to require
an increasing share in all regions of the world
in both absolute and relative terms. In developing countries, where 56 percent of the population will be living in urban areas by 2025, the
share of water going toward domestic uses will
also need to grow substantially.

water use to supply exceeds 40 percent. At such
levels, their patterns of use may not be sustainable, and water scarcity is likely to become the
limiting factor to economic growth.Special Theme: Water in the 215 Century

 

Water quality, pollution,
and the environment

Emerging Asia, published by ADB in 1997, identified water pollution as the most serious
environmental problem facing the region. Water
pollution exacerbates the problem of water scarcity at local and regional levels by reducing the
amount of water available for productive purposes. Water pollution comes from many
sources, including untreated sewage, chemical
discharges, spillage of toxic materials, harmful
products leached from land disposal sites, agricultural chemicals, salt from irrigation schemes,
and atmospheric pollutants dissolved in rainwater. The direct disposal of domestic and industrial wastewater into watercourses is the major
source of pollutants in developing countries. In
Asia and the Pacific, fecal pollution is one of the
most serious problems, affecting both surface
water and groundwater bodies and leading to a
tenacious persistence of such waterborne diseases
as cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis. Estimates of
the increase in water pollution loads in high
growth areas of Asia over the next decades are as
high as 16 times for suspended solids, 17 times
for total dissolved solids, and 18 times for biological pollution loading.* The impact of this can
be seen from the following comparison: the combined volume of water used and water needed
to dilute and flush pollutants is almost equal
to the volume of accessible freshwater in the
world's river systems.

The development of freshwater resources
for human uses has compromised natural ecosystems that depend on these resources for their
continued integrity. Freshwater ecosystems,
comprising lakes, rivers, and wetlands, have already lost a greater proportion of species and
habitat than land or ocean ecosystems. Unrestricted development of surface water and
groundwater has altered the hydrologic cycle
and threatens the natural functions of deltas
and wetlands. Wetlands have been converted
to cropland, and rivers that channeled water to
estuaries and deltas have dried up. The Yellow

 

River in the PRC, for example, is now dry during substantial portions of the year, while
adjacent wetlands that tempered floods have
been lost.

The Aral Sea basin illustrates vividly the
extent to which human intervention has
affected the natural functioning of aquatic
systems. Excessive diversion of water for
irrigation so reduced the flow of rivers entering the sea that its surface has shrunk by
45 percent and its volume by 70 percent since
1970. A formerly flourishing fishing industry
has collapsed, and major health problems are
now associated with windblown toxic salts
and contaminated residues. Diminished
productive potential, loss of vegetation,
increased health risks, and irreversible desecration of aquatic biota are the sad legacy.

A double-edged sword:
floods and droughts

Floods and droughts have always been features
of life on earth and have produced some of the
worst natural disasters in recorded history. Due
to inappropriate land use and land management
practices, uncoordinated and rapid growth of
urban areas, and loss of natural flood storage
wetlands, floods are becoming more frequent.

ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

According to the Office of the United Nations
Disaster Relief Coordinator, flooding is the
hazard that affects more people than any other.
Associated damage to property is escalating.
Concurrently, destruction of forest cover has
altered the hydrologic cycle and reduced water
retention in forest soils. Accompanying soil
erosion has permanently stripped fertile topsoil
from vast areas, leading to further degradation
of river basins and threatening the basis for
sustainable natural resource management.
Global climate change will have unpredictable
but potentially devastating consequences for the
hydrologic cycle by changing the total amount
of precipitation, its annual and seasonal
distribution, the onset of snowmelt, the
frequency and severity of floods and droughts,
and the reliability of existing water supply
reservoirs. According to the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, the frequency of
droughts could rise by 50 percent in certain
parts of the world by 2050.

Geographical variability in
water resources

Asia has the lowest per capita availability of
freshwater resources among the world's

he geographic region of the Pacific refers
to the Melanesian, Micronesian, and
Polynesian islands in the Pacific Ocean. The total
area covered by the region is vast: the Pacific
Ocean itself occupies almost one third of the
earth's surface. The Pacific islands, however,
comprise only 1.3 million square kilometers of
land area, of which 70 percent is in Irian Jaya and
Papua New Guinea, and 20 percent in New
Zealand. The remaining 10 percent of land area
is spread over more than 10,000 scattered islands.
There are two main groups: (i) small atolls
with severe water shortages and water quality
problems and (ii) larger volcanic and high
mountainous islands where water is generally
abundant. Both have fragile natural resource
bases, but suffer to different degrees from
inefficiency of water use, overuse of limited

continents. The contrasts within the region are
stark. Annual freshwater resources (in m> per
capita) reach as high as 200,000 in Papua New
Guinea and as low as 2,000 in parts of South
Asia and the PRC, and are generally below
20,000 in Southeast Asia (see figure at right).
The region's weather is largely governed by
a monsoon climate, which creates large
seasonal variations in addition to spatial
variation.

The two most populous nations in the
world, the PRC and India, will have 1.5 billion
and 1.4 billion people, respectively, by 2025,
by which time the availability of freshwater will
have dropped to 1,500 m* per capita in India
and 1,800 m? in the PRC.

Many of ADB's DMCs depend heavily on
groundwater exploitation to supplement scarce
surface water resources. In Bangladesh,
groundwater abstraction already represents
35 percent of total annual water withdrawals; in India, 32 percent; in Pakistan, 30 percent; and in PRC, 11 percent. Groundwater
overuse and aquifer depletion are becoming
serious problems in the intensively farmed
areas of northern PRC, India, and Pakistan.
In heavily populated cities such as Bangkok,
Jakarta, and Manila, land is subsiding as
groundwater is withdrawn to serve the needs

groundwater, pollution of both surface water and
groundwater bodies, and contamination due to
inadequate sanitation and waste management.

The first group—including some of the Cook
Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Tonga,
and Tuvalu—is deficient in surface water and
prone to prolonged droughts (especially Kiribati
and Tuvalu). Rainwater collection and storage,
supplemented where possible by extracting
groundwater from shallow freshwater lenses,
present the only real choice. Desalination has
been proposed in cases of extreme need, and
seawater is sometimes used for sanitation.
People generally conserve water and use it
sparingly. However, because surface water
supplies are highly unreliable and groundwater
resources limited, conflicts over ownership and
access are increasing. Saltwater intrusion andSpecial Theme: Water in the 215 Century 11

 

of their growing urban populations, and saltwater intrusion is rendering much of the
groundwater unusable.

The special circumstances affecting water
availability and quality in the Pacific are discussed in the box on page 10 and below.

Shared waters

International conflicts over water are becoming more frequent as competition for available
freshwater resources increases. There are
215 international rivers as well as about
300 groundwater basins and aquifers that are
shared by several countries. Although many difficult issues remain to be resolved, the 1996
treaty signed by Bangladesh and India for
managing flows in the Ganges-Brahmaputra
system represents a major victory for rational approaches to shared water resources.
Similarly, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan—
in recognition of their common strategic, economic, and environmental interests—created
in 1992 the Interstate Coordinating Water Commission to facilitate water sharing and common
solutions to related environmental issues. However, more than 70 water-related flash points

pollution by human waste are reducing the
availability of usable water.

The larger volcanic islands include Fiji
Islands, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon
Islands, and Vanuatu. Rainfall and surface
runoff are adequate to meet needs, but
pollution is a serious problem in urban areas.

international rivers to supply more than 30 percent of their annual water resources. Four of
these (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Uzbekistan, and
Viet Nam) rely on water from external sources
for more than 65 percent of their annual water
resources. The reliability of water supplies in
the face of such dependence is a key issue when
seasonal variations, particularly droughts and
El Nifo events, enter the equation. Unsustainable rates of groundwater extraction can only
make matters worse. The impact of global climate change, which cannot be determined at
this time, will be to increase the overall uncertainty within which water planners operate.

Heightened awareness
of water issues

Traditionally seen as limitless bounty, water has
only recently been recognized as a scarce
resource, and only since the 1950s have
policymakers begun to espouse the economic
and environmental values of water. Since the
1970s, a series of international meetings
addressed water issues, starting with the First
UN Water Conference at Mar del Plata in
March 1977. This was followed by others (the
box below shows the major international conferences that have drawn attention to the
serious condition of the globe's freshwater
resources in the last decade).

A consensus is growing among scientists,
water planners, governments, and civil society

that new policies and approaches will have to
be adopted within the next two decades to avoid
calamity, and that supply, use, and management
of water resources will have to be integrated
across sectors and between regions sharing the
same source.

The concept of fully integrated water
resource management (IWRM) emerged from
the Dublin and Rio Conferences of 1992. The
four guiding principles (now referred to as the
Dublin Principles) are (i) freshwater is a finite
and vulnerable resource, essential to sustain
life, development, and the environment;
(ii) water development and management should
be based on a participatory approach, involving users, planners, and policymakers at all
levels; (iii) women play a central part in providing, managing, and safeguarding water; and
(iv) water has an economic value in all its
competing uses and should be recognized as
an economic good.

Elements of a water strategy

Basic human rights and
environmental renewal

The Dublin Principles recognize that freshwater
is an input to which every human has the right
to claim an essential minimum amount—the
amount necessary to sustain life and meet basic
sanitation needs. For human survival, the
absolute minimum daily water requirement is

Major International Conferences in the 1990s

New Delhi): appealed for concerted action to ensure access for all to the basic human needs
of safe drinking water and environmentally sound sanitation.

capacity building necessary to create an enabling environment in the water sector.

only about 5 liters per day, whereas the daily
requirement for sanitation, bathing, and cooking needs, as well as for assuring survival, is
about 50 liters per person (equivalent to about
20 m? per year).’ Despite concerted efforts made
during the 1980s (the International Drinking
Water and Sanitation Decade), even this minimal amount was not provided in 55 countries
(representing close to 1 billion people) by 1990.

One in five people living today does not
have access to safe drinking water, and half the
world's population does not have adequate
sanitation. This is most acute in Asia where the
majority of the world's poor people live. Not
surprisingly, water- and sanitation-related dis

countries. A recent UN report® notes that "at In ADB's DMCs, an estimated 737 million people countries,

any given time, 50 percent of the population in
developing countries is suffering from waterrelated diseases caused either by infection, or
indirectly by disease-carrying organisms." The
global imperative is to ensure that at least
95 percent of human beings have safe water and
sanitation by 2025 (World Water Council 1999).

have no access to safe drinking water. Access
to sanitation is denied to 1.74 billion in rural areas
and 298 million in urban areas. This is a major
human tragedy; provision of such services to
all people should be one of the highest priorities
of all governments. The box on pages 14 and
15 provides a discussion of the issues affecting
water supply and sanitation in ADB's DMCs.

ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

At the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the rights
of all human beings to basic daily water requirements were expanded to include environmental
water needs. This was reinforced in a statement
issued by the UN in 1997: "... it is essential for
water planning to secure basic human and environmental needs for water [and]... develop sustainable water strategies that address basic human
needs, as well as preservation of ecosystems."

Water for poverty reduction

Not only are the poor more prone to the adverse
impacts of unsafe drinking water and inadequate sanitation, but ADB's field surveys also
consistently show that the poor spend disproportionately more of their incomes on potable
water than more privileged sections of the
community for whom piped water supplies are
assured. For example, the poor in Manila pay
as much as 10 percent of their household
income for a meager quantity of poor-quality
water (see box on page 16). While investments
in human capital (education, health care,
shelter, and protection from the effects of natural disasters) are also required to break the cycle
of poverty, the impacts of poor-quality drinking water and the lack of adequate sanitation

Water Supply and Sanitation in the Region

iP terms of human needs, water availability
is highly variable across Asia and the Pacific. In
Singapore, affordable high-quality water is
available to all, 24 hours a day. In rural Nepal,
fetching water for basic needs occupies up to four
hours a day. Most people in the region do not
have access in their homes to a 24-hour supply
and are forced to boil or filter the water they obtain
to make it potable.

In urban areas, unaccounted-for water
averages 35 percent of production. Leakage
(especially from house connections) probably
accounts for half of this. Illegal connections,
inadequate metering, and slack meter reading
account for the rest. Where tariffs are too low,
excessive water consumption (more than 150 liters
per capita per day) is common. By contrast, power
bills are normally about four times those for water.
Low tariffs mean that utilities are always

are particularly strong and immediate. The
policy imperative of this—for governments as
well as for ADB—is quite clear.

While the poor are disadvantaged in terms
of access to the benefits of improved water
supply and sanitation, poor women are ina particularly invidious situation. The gender division of labor in many societies allocates to
women the responsibility for collecting and
storing water, caring for children and the sick,
cooking, cleaning, and maintaining sanitation.
The availability of a decent water supply and
sanitation system goes a long way to improving the quality of life for poor women and their
families. In many parts of the region, the arduous task of walking long distances over difficult terrain to fetch water falls to women, often
with the help of their daughters. Women care
for the sick, who are often children suffering
diseases caused directly by contaminated water. Providing clean and dependable water close
to the home can substantially reduce women's
workloads, and free up time for women to
engage in economic activities to improve
household incomes. For girls, the time saved
can be used to attend school. Hence, providing water supply and sanitation is pivotal to
improving both the social and economic

struggling with financial viability and cannot contribute to capital investments.

Sewerage exists for less than 5 percent of
our regional population, and only about 20
percent have on-site septic tanks. Basic latrines
are available for about 50 percent, but as many
as 25 percent have no formal sanitation at all. In
urban areas, building controls are lax, and industries are often allowed to discharge effluents withCoV Latch ene (ctnl

Coco aal elie aCe) pm KOLMn 1 \1an eee o-oo) anna
and, because prior claim to a large portion of the
resource has often been established (particularly
by irrigators), urban suppliers are obliged to tap
sources remote from the users. An example is the
$400 million Melamchi Water Supply Project in
Nepal, which will draw water from three river
basins outside the Kathmandu Valley to serve
urban areas within the valley.Special Theme: Water in the 215 Century

status of women, while simultaneously addressing gender and poverty concerns. The
central role that women play in providing,
managing, and safeguarding water is recognized
in the third Dublin Principle.

Water for food production

A major problem to be resolved by 2025 is
producing enough food for the anticipated
population of 8 billion people. Economic
development and changes in food preferences
will exert strong demand for additional production and more varied food products. In 1998,
the International Water Management Institute
(IWMI) stated that in many parts of the world,
water is becoming the single most important
constraint to increased food production.
Even when good technical solutions appear
to be at hand, they do not always produce the
expected results; and the poorest, most vulnerable members of the community are among the
worst affected. In Bangladesh, for example, the
use of tubewells to raise shallow groundwater
has been promoted by funding agencies to support intensive irrigation while also providing
safe drinking water in rural areas. This gave a
dramatic boost during the last three decades

The three main problems facing the sector
are financial sustainability, water resource
availability, and equitable access. Planning for the
long term is now critical. Water rights for domestic
and industrial water supplies should be secured
for at least 50 years. Tariffs need to be set to
reflect the financial costs (and preferably the
economic costs) of water. For example, in the
water-scarce Maldives, consumers in the capital
of Malé pay the equivalent of $5 per cubic meter
for desalinated piped water. Distortions in tariffs,
where one part of a community cross-subsidizes
another, need to be smoothed out, and all
schemes should make adequate supplies available
in poor areas. The poor can, and are willing, to
pay for water.

In rural areas, special efforts are needed to
reduce the distance to water supplies wherever
possible and to encourage conservation

to agricultural production, bringing the prospect of food self-sufficiency within reach for the
first time. However, the same water has recently
been found to contain traces of naturally
occurring arsenic. Arsenic buildup in the body
initially manifests itself through the appearance
of skin diseases, and prolonged ingestion damages internal organs, leading to cancer and
death. About 20 million people are at risk. The
Government, with the aid of nongovernment
organizations (NGOs) and international agencies, has embarked on a nationwide program
to define site-specific countermeasures, but this
may not be adequate to avoid suffering and loss
of life for people who cannot afford alternative
water supplies.

IWMI notes in its draft strategic plan for
2000-2005 (October 1999) that "the potential
for expanding irrigated area is extremely limited." The UN has estimated the potential area
for new irrigation as 45 million hectares
worldwide, which could provide up to 21 percent of the projected additional food needs.
Increases in yield and cropping intensity are
expected to provide the rest. However, erosion,
waterlogging, and land degradation are reducing the area of irrigated land; and some of the
most fertile and productive areas close to urban

approaches, such as rainwater harvesting. Based on
ADB's evaluation of many water supply and
sanitation projects, itis essential to include complementary education in hygiene to derive the full
health benefits of improvements in infrastructure.

Privatization of urban water supplies has
not so far achieved a remarkably high success
rate. Independent regulatory bodies are needed
to reduce political interference and ensure
accountable management and efficient delivery
of water. The challenges in future are to (i) open
up competition, (ii) allow domestic privatization, (iii) allow existing utilities to operate
with transparent cost recovery policies and
independent regulatory bodies, (iv) greatly
increase tariffs to affordable limits, and
(v) introduce performance benchmarking in all
utilities. An urgent need exists to reduce nonec TeU CCMA ol16

ADB's 1998 study of rural
Asia noted that, from 1966 to
1988, the real cost of new irrigation schemes increased by
more than 150 percent in South
and Southeast Asia. Given the
limited scope for expanding irrigation and the sharply increased cost of new irrigation
schemes, the justification for investing in new
irrigation grows steadily weaker. The future of
irrigation lies mainly in improving the efficiency
of present irrigation schemes in terms of
operational performance and water use, supported by the introduction of mechanisms to
ensure financial sustainability. Expansion of
irrigation, where possible, will need to be justified on criteria of cost-effectiveness relative
to other uses. Water-scarce regions need to plan
for a future in which they may not be able to
achieve food self-sufficiency.

In a world where food security can no
longer be assured by an ever-expanding
irrigation sector, what possibilities exist for
increasing food production? The future of
agriculture will increasingly be linked to careful use of marginal areas. Techniques for water
harvesting and supplemental irrigation have
shown great promise for increasing crop yields,

offer the greatest potential for increasing grain

needed, and both assistance and encouragement should be provided to poor farmers to help
overcome their reluctance to invest time and
scarce resources into inherently risky farming.
Smallholder water management systems,
where groups of farmers finance relatively
small water capture and distribution infrastructure, can eliminate much of the insecurity of rain-fed agriculture without increasing
stress on the available water resources. Crops
with low water requirements should be selected, and technology employed to determine
accurately the exact amounts of water needed
at different stages of crop growth. Innovative techniques for precision irrigation will
also help to increase the productivity of
water—ensuring more crop per drop. ADB
supports research in selecting appropriate
crops for nonirrigated areas, for example, by
providing regional technical assistance (approved in 1999) for collecting, conserving, and
using indigenous vegetables.

Water as a finite and
economic good

The limits of the world's freshwater resources
have become all too apparent, even though in
many of the world's regions, detailed data on
the hydrologic cycle are not available. Inefficient
use, often initiated and then reinforced by
government subsidies, has become ingrained;
and the attendant water rights, whether formal
or informal, are jealously defended by the

left to cover costs of power, water, gas, medicines, and schooling.

Water costs Winnie $20 per month, or 7 percent of their household income. She used to pay
$12.50 per month for a metered piped supply
from a deep tubewell operated by a private
contractor. However, the supply was only for
one hour twice a day. She paid another $7.50
per month for drinking water purchased by the
container from another contractor. The sourceSpecial Theme: Water in the 215 Century

privileged users. Agriculture and manufacturing
use the greatest share of the world's water. Irrigation is particularly voracious, accounting for up
to 80 percent of water demand in hot, dry regions.

The river basin constitutes the natural
hydrologic unit within which users compete for
the same resource and water quality is modified
in ways that affect its value to other users.
Management of water resources must therefore
be approached on a comprehensive basis within
this hydrologic unit. Beyond the basic needs for
human well-being and environmental renewal,
scarcity of water is largely an economic issue. This
idea, that water has an economic value in all its
competing uses and should be recognized as an
economic good, must underlie all efforts for
rational water resource management.

Part of the value of water is reflected in the
costs of extraction and delivery to the users. As
a minimum, users should pay these costs to
ensure accountability and financial sustainability. In addition, the opportunity cost,
representing the value of the resource to some
other user, must be considered. And finally,
there are also the external costs related to the
impacts on the environment and the health
effects of polluted water.

Treating water as a tradable commodity
would help ensure greater efficiency and productivity in its use. However, important cultural
concerns and complex issues exist regarding
resource sustainability and natural habitat,
which means that government intervention is
needed in resource allocation and investment
decisions. Governments should therefore
establish the policy, legislative, and regulatory
frameworks for managing water supply and

was purported to be from the concessionaire's
piped supply.

Recently, there was trouble with both sources
of water at the same time. The deep tubewell
closed down due to pump problems. Diarrhea and
typhoid broke out in the neighborhood. One of

Winnie's boys had to be hospitalized.

Now Winnie has a connection to a more distant deep tubewell and is selling water (not fit for
drinking) by the container to five of her neighbors

demand. Governments should also provide
financing for large water projects—dams, largescale irrigation, flood control—for which private financing may not be readily available. They
should also intervene, directly or indirectly, to
ensure that water resources are used in the most
beneficial way for the greater society.

Allocations frequently become locked,
however, into what are clearly low-return uses
(e.g., irrigation), when new projects are required
to meet priority high-return needs (e.g., cities
and industries). As the readily accessible water
resources become committed, the costs of new
projects can rise rapidly, resulting in high
economic costs relative to the alternative of
reallocating existing supplies. Even if countries
are willing to incur the subsidies inherent in
such solutions—for instance, to meet social,
political, or environmental objectives—the full
burden of these subsidies is seldom transparent;
large costs may inadvertently be incurred as a
result of inefficient resource allocations
resulting from such decisions.

Imperatives for wise water
management

From development to water
resource management

The past century has seen enormous changes
in the way society conducts the business of
economic development, food production, and
trade. Concurrently, and especially in the latter
part of the century, there has been an explosion
in the construction of large projects for water

who do not have water. At $1.25 for the first
10 cubic meter (m?) and $0.40 per m? thereafter,
she fears she may not have collected enough to

The message brought home by Winnie's case
study is that the poor can and do pay for water.
Local governments should ensure that piped
water supplies reach the poorer areas, and that
the poor are assisted to make use of such supplies.18

storage, flood control, irrigation, and hydropower. These were conceived and realized in
an atmosphere of challenge: how to tame nature
to serve the needs of humanity. The limits to
the scale of the projects were set by the ingenuity of engineering solutions. The driving
forces were population growth, food security,
and industrial development. According to the
UN Food and Agriculture Organization, irrigated
area grew from 50 million to 250 million ha in
the last century, and withdrawals of freshwater
increased from 500 to about 4,000 km? per year.
Most large-scale projects have been
financed by governments, and governments
have naturally assumed responsibility for their
management. The absence of private investors
reflects not only the scale of the investments
required, but also the fact that for some of these
projects there were political objectives: for
example, to encourage development in remote
areas or to distribute development funds among
regions. In many cases, it was assumed that users
would repay the investment costs through water
and other charges. This did not always happen.
The repayment obligations have been eased and
the cost of providing the services has frequently
become institutionalized as a direct subsidy.

engineering solutions to provide the appropriate freshwater supply. However, because of
natural resource constraints and the accumulating adverse environmental impact of past
projects, changes are beginning to be made in
the way planners approach the problems of
water supply. This is evident as a discernible
shift from water resource development toward
supply and demand management. The tightening fiscal environment, recent financial crisis,
and reduction in the potential for developing
additional surface water and groundwater supplies have added impetus to this shift in the last
decades. In addition, people the world over now
place a higher value on maintaining the ecological function of freshwater ecosystems. There
is also growing public pressure for the costs
and benefits of water development projects to
be shared more equitably and prudently, and
for investments to be directed toward satisfying basic human needs rather than benefiting
elite groups at a high cost to the community at
large. The heightened awareness of the issues
relating to large dams (and which are also
relevant to other large-scale engineering solutions) is described in the box below.

displacement of people to make way for the
construction of dams and their reservoirs can
cause great suffering and social dislocation. The
negative ecological impacts can extend upstream
into the reservoir and downstream to the sea.

There is now growing opposition in most
countries to new large dams, and several projects
have recently been canceled due to public opposition. There is also a stricter regulatory framework for such projects. International nongovernment organizations have played a role in fostering independent scrutiny of large dam projects,
and they have emboldened the affected communities to seek a greater role in decisions that
impact directly on their lives. The good dam sites
(and many not so good sites) have already been
used, and strict environmental and social conditions are now imposed.Special Theme: Water in the 215 Century

From public good to priced commodity

Improving the efficiency of water use is
indispensable. In the United States, contrary to
all expectations, total water use has declined
by 10 percent since 1980, even with population
growth and a continued increase in economic
wealth. Industrial use has declined by 40 percent from a peak in 1970, while industrial output and productivity have both increased.
Similarly, in Japan, where industrial output has
soared since the 1970s, total industrial water
use has fallen by 25 percent. These reductions
have been achieved through technological
improvements (using less water to produce the
same goods) and a change in the composition
of industries making up the sector. The potential to reduce industrial use through further
innovation, improved technology, and cost
incentives is 20-30 percent. Comparable saving
is possible in developing countries.
Residential water use, although only a
small part (about 10 percent) of total water use,
can be reduced without sacrificing living
standards. Readily available means include

 

 

improving the efficiency of household appliances, better pricing structures, use of recycled
water for certain applications, and especially
reducing unaccounted-for water due to leaks
and nonmetered connections in aging distribution networks. In many cities, such as Dhaka,
Jakarta, and Manila, nonrevenue water exceeds
50 percent of water use.

The single largest variable in future water
use for human needs is irrigation. According
to the UN's Economic and Social Commission
for Asia and the Pacific, irrigation in Asia and
the Pacific accounts for 80 percent of total
withdrawals, compared with 70 percent globally. By far the largest share of investments
in agriculture during the green revolution era
went into irrigation schemes. These were
often—and remain—heavily subsidized. The
adopted technology was generally at the lowest end of the scale: as much as 60 percent
of the water is lost through leakage and
evaporation before it even reaches the crop
and an additional 20 percent may be lost on
the field.° There are few incentives for the
service providers or the farmers to improve

6  Alarge part of these losses returns to rivers through the drainage network and as groundwater seepage and is, therefore,
not lost from the river system, although the quality of return flows is often poor and limits their usefulness.

In response to growing concern, the World
Conservation Union (IUCN) and the World Bank
established an independent World Commission
on Dams in 1997 to review their development
effectiveness and develop standards, criteria, and
guidelines to guide decision makers in planning,
implementing, and decommissioning dams. Key
issues in three areas—social, environmental, and
economic/engineering—are being examined to
work toward a new consensus on the role of large
dams in sustainable development. The Commission's report is expected to be issued in August
2000. In support of this initiative, ADB is undertaking a regional technical assistance to examine
four major projects and to prepare recommendations on best practices for evaluating, designing, constructing, operating, monitoring, and
decommissioning dam projects in Asia.

A positive outcome of the growing opposition to large dams (and generally to large
engineering solutions to water-related problems)
is the impetus this has given to finding new ways
of solving problems of water scarcity. As a first step,
planners now look for ways of improving the
efficiency of existing physical infrastructure and
distribution systems, introducing more efficient
industrial processes, reallocating available water
among competing users, and finding innovative
ways of recycling water. These approaches are fully
concordant with ADB's policies and guidelines,
through which ADB encourages conservation and
more efficient use of water. ADB takes a proactive
role by helping its DMCs put in place sound policies
for integrated water resource management,
including pricing strategies and practices that
AWE Re Mian MLC -Tam CATON LIU a20

ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

the efficiency of water delivery and use in such
schemes where water is free or priced well
below its cost.

Agriculture's contribution to national
income is declining in all DMCs. The agriculture sector is, therefore, coming under increasing pressure to release water to meet other,
more productive needs. For producing highvalue crops in water-scarce areas, new irrigation techniques have been shown to be highly
efficient and cost-effective. Even simple
improvements in surface canal systems,
which are used almost exclusively in developing countries, can lead to impressive gains
in efficiency. Efforts to increase efficiency in
water use could, however, have serious impacts on poor farmers, who may not be able
to finance technological improvements.
Hence, special assistance may be required to
help poor farmers move up the technological
ladder. Potentially greater saving can be
achieved in delivering water, and the incentives
for such improvements should be structured in
such a way that the major beneficiaries (those
who will avail of the "saved" water) contribute
their share of the costs.

Groundwater irrigation presents a special
case of too much of a good thing. Rapid
expansion of groundwater irrigation during the

Waterlogging and Salinity in Pakistan

tlle Indus Basin irrigation system is
the largest contiguous irrigation system in the
world with three major dams, 19 barrages, and
43 interlinked canal systems. This vast system is
served by an equally large drainage network
commanding about 6 million hectares (ha). More
than 400,000 tubewells (mostly privately owned)
provide groundwater to supplement the surface
canal supplies.

As a result of inequitable water application
and inadequate drainage, 38 percent of the
irrigated area is now waterlogged. In addition,
irrigation adds more than 1.2 tons of salt per year
to each ha. The salt is carried into the root zone
where it reduces yields. The high rates of evaporation characteristic of the region's semiarid
climate have rendered 14 percent of the surface
too saline for use.

last two decades, initiated using public funding but now largely driven by private investment,
provided remarkable increases in yield, productivity, and area of irrigated crops in parts of
rural Bangladesh, PRC, India, Indonesia, and
Pakistan. However, unregulated extraction over
vast areas has caused extensive and rapid
lowering of the water table and, in coastal areas,
contributed to saltwater intrusion. In other
parts, overwatering (combined with inadequate
drainage) is bringing the water table dangerously close to the ground surface, rendering the
surface saline and unusable. The productivity
of some areas is now so threatened that large
investments will be needed to avert complete
collapse of the resource base, as described in
the box below.

Future water resource projects

New projects for dams, water storage, irrigation, drainage, flood protection, and water
supply will continue to be needed in many countries where the basic water requirements for
people have not yet been met. Sustainability
criteria will predominate in decision making and
particular emphasis will be given to environmental and social values. Increasingly, these projects
will be financed with private sector participation

Recognizing the seriousness of the waterlogging and salinity problems, the Government
Leyte F-Valme- a=) aT ARN ome Tae Mee Ta Nam a-re-TnnT heel a)
program in 1959. Originally focused on providing surface and subsurface drainage, the program
later included canal remodeling and selective
lining to reduce aquifer recharge.

The Government's 1993 Drainage Sector Environmental Assessment recommended measures for
overcoming the waterlogging and salinity problems:

* precluding further developments that

would mobilize salt from deep groundwater aquifers,

restricting irrigation to areas where
existing drainage is adequate,

ceasing public investment for drainage
where improvements could reasonably be
carried out by the private sector,Special Theme: Water in the 215 Century

21

 

where possible, and a wider range of stakeholders will be invited to participate in the process.

Before deciding to invest in new storage
and conveyance infrastructure, water planners
will consider using existing infrastructure to
meet the demands through reallocation of the
available water among users, taking advantage
of the greater efficiency offered by improved
technology and the opportunities for recycling
water. Major obstacles to the rational reallocation of water among users, however, are the
legal and regulatory constraints on water
transfers and, in many countries, the complex
systems of water rights that inhibit the free
movement of water as an economic good. An
additional constraint is the lack of detailed
understanding of the actual amount of water
needed for various processes.

Because of their scale and the need to
safeguard national and regional concerns above
local interests, flood control and flood protection projects represent a special case in which
private investment is unlikely to displace government funding. However, the desire to secure
higher levels of flood protection must be
balanced against the effectiveness of nonstructural alternatives (such as planning and
building controls, enhancing wetlands, providing means for evacuating persons and livestock,

* restricting subsurface drainage interventions to areas affected by saline groundwater, and only where there is an
environmentally acceptable means of
eliminating drainage effluent,
concentrating surface drainage interventions to areas at risk of storm water
damage, and
giving special attention to beneficiary
participation in both structural and
aoVaLee CAN e-] Inca TAy eels

It is recognized that structural interventions

to control waterlogging and salinity need to be
complemented by agricultural strategies that
promote the efficient use of water, beginning
at the national level and continuing to the field
level. Accordingly, in 1995 the Government
adopted a long-term strategy for institutional

flood-proofing of essential infrastructure, and
improving flood warning systems), which are
less expensive and which do not disturb the river
system and its aquatic ecology. The potential
exists in most countries for greater use of flood
damage insurance. Properly managed, this
would avoid the cost escalation of disaster rehabilitation and flood protection. Modern approaches emphasize balanced structural and
nonstructural measures within an integrated and
comprehensive plan for management of natural resources in the river basin.

For flood protection and all future projects
using and controlling freshwater resources, the
operational guidelines and procedures need to
be adjusted to account for greater variability in
climate as a result of global warming. This could
add considerably to their costs.

Irrigation and drainage projects have
accounted for about 10 percent of the total lending of the international financing agencies, and
such financing has been the most important
factor behind the rapid expansion in irrigated
agriculture since the 1960s. As shown in the
figure, ADB's lending for irrigation and drainage for the past three decades represents
33 percent of the $15.7 billion in total lending
for water projects. In many cases, the irrigation schemes have performed well below

reforms in the water sector. The role of the
Government was redefined with the objective
of phasing out subsidies for operation and
maintenance of irrigation schemes within
10 years, and decentralizing management of
irrigation and drainage services. Separate
organizations will be established for operation
and maintenance of each main canal system,
and secondary irrigation and drainage systems
will be transferred to farmer organizations.
Implementation started in 1996 and is being
supported by major international financiers,
including ADB, World Bank, and Japan Bank for
International Cooperation.

Despite such environmental problems,
irrigated agriculture continues to support the
country's economic development and provides

expectations. Yet, the same agencies have
repeatedly supported programs for rehabilitation and improvement of physical infrastructure,
often ignoring the institutional and statutory
obstacles to more responsive service provision
and sustainable operation. In response to
growing competition for the available resources,
both financial and physical, many countries are
now tackling the challenge of policy and
institutional reforms to achieve integrated water
resource management and sustainable operation and maintenance of their irrigation
schemes.

Creation of incentives for more efficient
allocation and delivery of water is now urgently
needed throughout Asia and the Pacific. First,
user charges must be levied. These should be
fair, consistently applied, and set at levels that
not only distinguish different uses but also
ensure access for disadvantaged groups (especially the poor, and among the poor women).
All users in the river basin must be included in
any system of water charging. Second, the
conditions for trading of water rights should be
created. This requires clear definition of water
rights, a condition that does not yet exist in most
countries. In a complementary manner, greater
control of the operation and maintenance of
irrigation schemes needs to be given
to the users.

The current global commitment of financial resources for all
water-related infrastructure is
estimated to be $80 billion annually. For water supply and sanitation alone, an annual investment
of about $70 billion would be
required over the next 10 years.
Although official development assistance will continue to provide
an important part of the necessary
resources, the private sector will
be called on increasingly. ADB's
lending for water-related operations in 1999 totaled $1.24 billion
(25 percent of total lending), an indication of the importance attached to water sector operations.
Nevertheless, this represents only
a small part of the total need.

ADB's evolving role in the
changing context

ADB's experience and lessons learned

ADB has implemented 437 water-related
projects, for which financing totaling $15.7 billion has been provided (see figures at right).
Evaluation studies show 51 percent of these
projects were generally successful, but 11 percent were unsuccessful. Success was evaluated
by a variety of indexes—including economic
internal rate of return—many of which are
affected by external factors, such as changes in
the economic environment. For instance,
declining real rice prices over the long term have
adversely affected the economic evaluation o
many irrigation projects.

An analysis of ADB's water operations

shows positive trends for such concerns as the
incorporation of social and environmenta
dimensions, increased water user responsibility and water use efficiency, cost recovery,
institutional strengthening, quality control, and
monitoring arrangements. ADB's water projects,
however, tended to be identified, processed,
administered, and evaluated within their
subsector context, reflecting the fragmented
approach to planning and implementing water
projects in most DMCs. For example, lega
aspects of water allocation have been addresse
in less than one quarter of approved projects,
and only one third of the projects included water
conservation measures. This tends to confirm
that ADB's water loans have, in the past, focuse'
largely on improving water services (supply-side
solutions) in a subsector context, and that relatively few have addressed water resource issues,
including water scarcity and efficient allocation
of water between different uses.
The striking lesson from ADB's involvement
in water-related projects is that, as competition for water increases, a more comprehensive and integrated approach to water
operations is needed to encompass goals of
social welfare, environmental integrity, and
economic productivity. Fundamental actions to
achieve this are

* — stakeholder participation in all stages

of the project cycle;Special Theme: Water in the 215 Century

* attention to the complementary roles
of the public and private sectors,

economic instruments to improve
allocation efficiency;

services are extended to poor areas
and that rights of access are assured

groups;

* environmental protection and enhancement as an integral part of every

context; and

* acquiescence of directly affected
communities prior to committing
investment funds.

Anew generation of water projects with an
integrated approach to supply and demand
management has emerged. These incorporate
fully the principles of integrated water resource
management and build on country-specific
analyses of water resource needs, constraints,
and potential. The first such analysis was made
with ADB assistance in Sri Lanka in 1993 and
led to the formulation of a national water sector
profile and reform action plan. This was
followed by ADB-supported institutional
strengthening and policy reforms, which will
pave the way for new investments in water
resource development. Other examples include
Lao People's Democratic Republic, Pakistan, and
Viet Nam where ADB is now supporting policy
reforms and capacity building for integrated
water resource management. An ADB-financed
assessment of the water sector in the PRC
(concluded in 1999) helped formulate strategic
initiatives and an action plan that reflect a shift
from a sectoral focus toward a more integrated
and comprehensive approach. Projects now
being prepared in the PRC are tackling
traditional water resource problems in
conjunction with biodiversity conservation

and legislative changes for improved natural
resource management.

As the private sector assumes greater
importance in development financing, ADB's
catalytic role of mobilizing private capital has
also grown. ADB's private sector support focuses
on projects with significant economic and social
merit and, where, because of long payback
periods or perceived high risks, private investors have tended to be reticent. In the water
sector, provided the projects are part of a wellconceived privatization strategy, ADB encourages private initiatives by providing direct
financial support. Significant recent examples
are the Maynilad Water Services Project for

evolving water policy, which encourages increased
private sector participation to improve service
accountability, such initiatives are expected to
increase and encompass an ever-widening range
of social infrastructure.

ADB's evolving water policy

Lack of effective water policies and institutional
arrangements is a pressing issue in most of
ADB's DMCs. In the absence of reforms, private
investments and increased community involvement will remain severely constrained, and
potentially wasteful and destructive projects will
be embarked upon. ADB's policy recognizes this
problem and sets out a process for implementing
water sector reforms as a prerequisite to new
investments. To avail of ADB assistance,
governments will need to adopt national water
policies, laws, institutional reform, sector
coordination mechanisms, and a national water
action agenda.

Financial incentives and regulation, together with concerted efforts to protect water
quality, aquatic ecosystems, and watersheds,
need to be reinforced to improve the efficiency
and sustainability of resource use.

Regional Cooperation in the Water Sector

Pia cooperation need not be complex and controversial when it comes to
exchanging information and experience in water
sector policies and reforms. While circumstances are different in each country, there are
enough common issues in the water sector that
make such an exchange useful and costeffective. Following its regional water policy
consultation in 1996, ADB has promoted
subregional water resource cooperation in
Southeast Asia and South Asia in collaboration
with the Global Water Partnership. These
resulted in subregional water partnerships
being established.

Stakeholder recognition and participation
will be promoted, and the needs of women and
vulnerable groups will be adequately considered in water projects. New partnerships
between public, private, community, and NGO
stakeholders will be developed to ensure
effective policy reform and environmentally
sustainable, socially acceptable projects.

Implementing such reforms will require
sustained financial and policy support, for which
ADB has a comparative advantage because of
its long experience of working with water agencies in the region. In addition, its cofinancing
modalities and experience in catalyzing private
investments provide a window for increasing
support from other funding agencies.

Possible changes in climate are of particular concern in Asia and the Pacific where such
phenomena as monsoons, the El Nino Southern Oscillation, and tropical cyclones play such
a large role. ADB has supported regional studies on the possible impacts of climate change
and is assisting its DMCs to develop national
response strategies to help them cope with the
greater climatic uncertainty. Comprehensive
coastal zone management plans have been prepared for countries vulnerable to sea level
changes, and national strategies for managing
water resources under conditions of heightened
uncertainty will form part of the policy agenda.

Making better use of Asia's shared rivers is
an unfinished agenda with potentially large

ADB's regional water policy consultations in
Southeast Asia concluded that

* water has become the critical natural
resource in most countries of Asia and the

benefits to millions of poor people in the region.
However, formulating agreements between subregions to enable equitable sharing of resources
and better control of transboundary pollution
has proven to be highly controversial and, in
some cases, strongly divisive. In promoting regional cooperation, ADB has the potential to
play an increasingly important role. ADB has
shown its capability to act as a fair and impartial broker in analyzing the needs of populations both upstream and downstream, as
demonstrated by its support to the countries
of the Greater Mekong Subregion to expand
their cooperation around a broader economic
agenda of priority regional projects. ADB has
also promoted international cooperation in
other river basins, such as the Red River shared
by the PRC and Viet Nam. ADB's role in promoting international cooperation is well illustrated by its regional water policy consultations,
as described in the box on page 24 and below.

ADB's water policy, which is being formulated after extensive global and regional consultations, for consideration by the Board of
Directors in 2000, will embody an integrated
approach to water resource assessment within
the river basin as the basic hydrologic unit. The
water policy will incorporate pro-poor strategies and respond to the shift from water resource development to management of supply
and demand. Its seven major policy elements
are described in the box on page 26.

national water apex bodies should be
formed to oversee sector reforms;

a range of modalities for river basin

Looking ahead:
working for a blue revolution

The hope for the future lies in doing for water
productivity what the green revolution did for
crop productivity. This "blue revolution," as it
has been termed by various scientists and water
planners, would dramatically improve the efficiency of freshwater use, particularly in agriculture. The revolution will begin with greater
public awareness of the potential dangers of a
business-as-usual approach; help create
policies, strategies, and incentives needed to
establish integrated water resource management on a global basis; and culminate in the

In South Asia, regional consultations resolved
that

* sustainability of water resources, institutions, and financing is critical to poverty

national water policies need to adopt
cross-sectoral approaches and be practical and implementable;
water institutions need to be reformed to
deal with cross-sectoral dimensions
through approaches that involve stakeholders at all levels; and

need to focus on people's needs, equity,
gender, and accountability.ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

allocation of resources to effect the
social, institutional, and technological changes necessary for efficient
water allocation and use.

ADB is keenly aware of the
magnitude of the challenges to be
faced in water resource management during the coming decades if
the worst-case scenarios are to be
avoided. ADB has wide experience
in analyzing the macroeconomic impacts of subsidies, formulating
appropriate cost recovery and costsharing strategies, institutionalizing
community participation in resource
management, improving governance
and transparency, making environmental enhancement cost-effective,
and building capacity. ADB, as a rigorously impartial and fair adviser,
has particular strength in promoting and fostering regional cooperation for shared water resources.
ADB's approach stresses actions to
ensure fair and equitable access for
the poor and for others whose voices have not
always been heard in decisions affecting the
allocation of resources. ADB recognizes the special role of women in ensuring the health and
well-being of families, both as principal agents
for fetching water and preventing the spread of
waterborne diseases, and as highly productive
farmers and irrigators.

 

Elements of ADB’s Water Policy

he following policy elements are being
developed in the proposed water policy:

* promote effective national water policies
and action programs;
apply principles of socially inclusive
development to improve the equitability

of water service delivery; support adoption
of appropriate pricing policies to promote
greater efficiency; and encourage decentralization and autonomy to foster
increased private sector participation and
to improve service accountability;

 

ADB is equally aware of the opportunities that exist for concerted action by governments, funding agencies, private sector,
and civil society for improving the management of natural resources. A consensus has
been formed among the international funding agencies for strong cooperation and concerted action in analyzing the needs of each
country and region, identifying common goals
among conflicting stakeholders, and adopting uniform standards and criteria for development decision making. Cooperation to
achieve the maximum impact of development
assistance will be the hallmark of international aid in the 21° century.

Despite the difficult choices that must be
made worldwide to ensure sustainable water
use and management, there is some cause for
optimism. Commitment to stricter environmental controls and their enforcement does help
to maintain healthier ecological conditions
and can restore the severely degraded
environment. The efficiency of water use can
be improved without sacrificing quality of life,
and such improvements can alleviate, if not
completely avoid, looming water crises.
Adopting socially inclusive policies to spread
the benefits of water resource development
to the poor and other traditionally disadvantaged members of the community benefits
society as a whole by improving living
conditions, health, social stability, and opportunities for productive employment.

n 1999, the Board of Directors approved a

radical shift in the way ADB operates. With

the adoption of its new poverty reduction

strategy, ADB refocused its work to make
eliminating poverty from the region its main
mission.

This chapter examines this mission and
ADB's previously agreed strategic objectives—
promoting economic growth, developing human
resources (including education, health, population planning, social protection, and urban
development), improving the status of women,
and protecting the environment. Law and policy
reform, regional cooperation, and private sector participation are also discussed, as are
various social dimensions of development in
ADB-financed operations. Also covered are
resource transfers, cofinancing and guarantee
operations, portfolio management, and the performance evaluation and development impact
of ADB's 1999 program.

Poverty reduction, the new
overarching goal of ADB

Anew social policy agenda is emerging in Asia
and the Pacific. Economic growth and investment in human development are in themselves not sufficient to eradicate poverty in

rom 9 to 12 November 1999, ADB, in close
cooperation with the World Bank, held the
Manila Social Forum at ADB's headquarters. Highlevel representatives from around the world discussed the new social policy agenda emerging
from transition from centrally planned to market

economies and globalization in Southeast, Central, and East Asia.

The Forum discussed a range of topics such
as inclusive labor markets; rationalizing social public expenditure by decentralizing social services; the
role of the private sector in job creation, governance,

the region. In response to this agenda, ADB’s
President announced that reducing poverty
would become ADB's main goal; and in
November 1999, ADB's new poverty reduction
strategy was adopted.

The new strategy rests on three pillars:
(i) pro-poor, sustainable economic growth
based on policies and programs that facilitate
employment and income generation for the
poor; (ii) social development, which can enable
the poor to make full use of opportunities to
improve their living standard, and programs
that directly address the severity of poverty;
and (iii) good governance to ensure that the
poor have better access to basic services and
greater voice and participation in the
decisions affecting them. The strategy
requires that all ADB operations—lending,
technical assistance, capacity building, economic and sector work, donor coordination,
and policy dialogue—contribute to reducing
poverty in each DMC.

Promoting pro-poor, sustainable
economic growth

Growth is neither automatically pro-poor, nor
by itself broad-based and inclusive. It must be
made so. This requires that (i) equity in access
to and use of production factors, such as land,

and poverty; the new challenge of urban poverty;
and the building of proactive social safety nets.
The Forum revealed that many solutions—
valid before globalization in the mid-1990s—need
to be reexamined. Social safety nets need to be
established, and public systems built up. There must
be increased responsibilities for a transparent and
good-governed state, and greater emphasis on
stakeholders. The discussions on the interrelation
between governance and poverty highlighted the
importance for international finance institutions
to strengthen their good governance activities.ANNUAL REPORT 1999

Listening to Stakeholders

| Nn preparing its poverty reduction strategy, ADB
sought the input of stakeholders through
consultation workshops and Internet dialogue.
Consultations were held in Bangladesh, People's
Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Kyrgyz
Republic, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet
Nam.

A range of stakeholders participated in these
two- to three-day workshops, including representatives from local and central governments,
nongovernment organizations, academics, development agencies, and funding agencies.

The major objective of the consultations
was to identify lessons learned from poverty

 

the poor have increased access to project facilities
and services; and (vii) economic growth be sustained by enhancing quality and productivity of
the environment and natural resources.

Supporting social development

Economic growth most effectively reduces poverty when accompanied by comprehensive programs for social development. Just as some
targeting of economic development is necessary to reach bypassed areas, so also must
social development be targeted. ADB's strategy
recognizes this.

Social protection assists individuals,
households, groups, and communities to better manage risks and achieve economic stability. Such programs include old-age pensions,
insurance, formal and informal social safety
nets, and policies to improve labor standards and
labor mobility. In many societies, women suffer
disproportionately from the burden of poverty
and are systematically excluded from access to
essential assets. Also, women often contribute
more to improving the living standard and the
income of poor households through their work,
spending patterns, care giving, and other
activities. Improving the status of women,
particularly poor women, addresses a priority
area of poverty reduction and provides important socioeconomic returns through reduced
health and welfare costs, and lower fertility and
maternal and infant mortality rates.

reduction efforts in each country, examine
emerging strategies, and explore ways in which
the new ADB strategy might best support
national efforts and priorities.

The key findings of the consultations
undertaken and the nine country studies are
summarized in an ADB publication Reducing

The working draft of the poverty reduction
strategy was placed on ADB's web site
(http://www.adb.org) to encourage further
stakeholder dialogue and was shared with a
peer review group of experts worldwide, before
being adopted in November 1999.Operational Priorities

Facilitating good governance

The quality of governance is critical to poverty
reduction. Good governance facilitates participatory, pro-poor policies as well as sound
macroeconomic management. It ensures the
transparent use of public funds, encourages
growth of the private sector, promotes effective delivery of public services, and helps establish the rule of law. Since effective and
efficient delivery of basic services by the public
sector matters most to the poor, weak governance hurts them disproportionately.

In recognition of the importance of good
governance for sustained economic development in Asia and the Pacific, ADB adopted, in
October 1995, a policy on governance that
identified four means to sustained economic
development: accountability, participation, predictability, and transparency. Since 1995, ADB
has engaged in a variety of country-based and
subregional technical assistance activities to
disseminate international experience in governance and public management, and through
loans, has supported several governance reform
programs adopted by the governments of its
developing member countries (DMCs).

As a major extension of its governance
policy, ADB formally adopted an anticorruption
policy in 1998. The policy is centered on three
objectives: (i) supporting competitive markets
and public administrations that are efficient,
effective, accountable, and transparent;

(ii) supporting promising anticorruption initiatives on a case-by-case basis and improving the
quality of dialogue with DMCs on a range of
governance issues, including corruption; and
(iii) ensuring that ADB's projects and staff
adhere to the highest ethical standards.

ADB's development objectives

With the adoption of its poverty reduction strategy, ADB ensured the primacy of its attack on
poverty. Its previously agreed strategic development objectives—promoting economic
growth, developing human resources, improving the status of women, and protecting the
environment—are still integral to ADB's work,
but they are being pursued in ways that enhance poverty reduction. Other key development objectives and crosscutting priorities,
such as law and policy reform, regional cooperation, private sector development, and
social dimensions of development are contributing significantly to ADB's main goal.

Promoting economic growth

Economic growth projects, including those in
energy, transport and communications, industry,
finance (see box on page 30), and agriculture, were
pursued by ADB in 1999. Interventions often
combined microfinance, agriculture sector support
services, livestock development, rural road and

design and implementation of programs that
involve nongovernment organizations (NGOs),
community-based organizations (CBOs), and
other stakeholder groups.

Agriculture projects focusing on production
are a key to reducing poverty. Agriculture
investments tend to create more jobs than equivalent investments in other sectors and can directly
target pockets of poverty (see box on page 31).

In 1999, ADB lent $2.9 billion for 23 public
sector-financed projects (excluding technical assistance loans) with economic growth as the primary development objective. This represented
50 percent of all the projects approved during the
year and 60 percent of the total lending volume
in the public sector. Policy-based program lending accounted for 41.7 percent of ADB's ordinary
capital resources (OCR) of $1.6 billion and
11.6 percent of its Asian Development Fund
resources Of $124.0 million in 1999.

Supporting human development

ADB's main human development objective is to
reduce poverty by improving the health, living
standards, and livelihood of people in its DMCs.
This is done by strengthening institutions;
building capacity; reforming policy; and providing loans and technical assistance in education,
health and nutrition, water supply and sanitation, and urban sectors.

No country or region has done well in
reducing poverty without first providing widespread basic education and health services.
Education helps to empower the poor, to
enhance their income-earning potential, and to
improve the quality of their lives. Without basic
education—without basic skills and knowledge—the poor lack the tools essential for
breaking the poverty cycle. People with basic
education are more productive and more likely
to earn higher incomes. Where attention has
been paid to educating women, multiple

Supporting Economic Growth Through Infrastructure Development

Sei In 1999, three out of five energy
projects, totaling $607 million, had economic
growth as their primary objective. In Indonesia,
a $380 million Power Sector Restructuring
Program will ensure a stable supply of electricity,
essential for the country's economic recovery, and
a $20 million capacity-building loan will facilitate
the establishment of a competitive electricity
market. Two other projects are for upgrading the
Dhaka Power System in Bangladesh ($157 million) and for rural electrification, distribution, and
transmission in Nepal ($50 million).

Transport and Communications: Five out
of 10 projects in the transport and communications sector, totaling $613 million, focused on
economic growth. In the People’s Republic of
China, ADB continued to support the development of the primary road system with the
approval of the Shanxi Road Development
Project and the Southern Yunnan Road Development Project, each for $250 million. The
projects are in the poorer interior provinces and
are expected to enhance incomes and reduce
poverty by lowering transport costs. Connecting provincial and county roads will also be
improved or constructed, providing better

access for the rural population to market
opportunities, social services, and employment.
In Mongolia, ADB provided $25 million to upgrade
the second key segment of the road linking
Ulaanbaatar to the PRC and the Russian
Federation. Important regional trade benefits and
reduced transport costs will result. In Papua New
Guinea, roads are being upgraded and maintained
through a $63 million ADB project. In Viet Nam,
a $25 million East-West Corridor road project is

ADB provided $36 million to the Kyrgyz Republic
to support reform in the finance sector by
improving financial intermediation and broadening and deepening the capital markets, which are
expected to lead to more efficient mobilization
and allocation of capital in the economy. The
other two projects are for trade, export promotion, and industry in Pakistan ($307 million) and
for state-owned enterprise reform and corporate
governance in Viet Nam ($100 million).benefits have been obtained: educated women
have lower fertility rates and their children have
lower infant mortality rates; and educated
mothers are more likely to use health services
and to send their children to school.

Children from poor families are less likely
to attend or to complete school and, as adults,
these children will be less likely to improve
their quality of life or that of their own children. The poor child—who was malnourished
as an infant—may have diminished learning
ability, may suffer from chronic disease, and
therefore may be unable to benefit fully from
schooling. A child from a poor family is less
likely to receive appropriate stimulation and
encouragement at home and may find the
transition from home to school more difficult. Early childhood development programs
ensure adequate nutrition and health care,
help compensate for disadvantaged home
environments, and lay the foundation for
better performance at school.

n 1999, loans to the agriculture and natural
resource sector totaled $430.4 million for six
projects in five countries. In addition, technical
assistance of $28.4 million was provided for
capacity building, strategic planning, and

technical assistance, and 21 project preparatory
technical assistance were provided to 14 countries in 1999.

in promoting greater community participation and cost sharing in irrigation projects.
In agriculture, assistance was provided for

Uzbekistan. A regional technical assistance
enabled ADB’s developing member countries
and other stakeholders to participate in formulating ADB's microfinance strategy. In
addition, project preparatory assistance was
provided to Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan,
and Viet Nam to formulate agriculture projects
to enhance farm incomes through improved
productivity, diversification into high-value
crops, and improved input and market linkages.
Aregional study on the problems and concerns
of rural Asia was completed. The results of this
study will be used to formulate a rural

ADB and education: Work continued in
1999 on preparing an updated education sector policy paper to assess ADB's evolving role
in education, with particular attention to
education's role in reducing poverty. Of all types
of education, primary education is clearly the
most important for poverty reduction. But even
when this is available and successfully completed by the poor, their transition to higher
education and training is limited. Strategies for
education and poverty reduction must identify
ways to ensure equity of access to education
beyond the basic levels. As poor adults are likely
to have had no access to education in their
childhood or to have dropped out of school
early, investing in adult and community education programs (designed to teach basic literacy and numeracy, transfer essential

both higher education and skills development

qualifications often require completion of lower
levels of education that are often not completed
by the poor. Because books and supplies are
expensive, the cost of such programs is usually
beyond the means of the poor, even when tuition is provided free. The opportunity cost of
attending post-basic education training in terms
of income foregone is higher for the poor, whose
immediate income is needed by the family. ADBassisted programs in higher education and skills
development support programs to enhance equity
of access to higher levels of education and training for the poor through the provision of vouchers and scholarships, and develop alternative
means of delivering and assessing skills training

ADB and health: ADB's updated health
sector policy, adopted in February 1999, reemphasizes primary health care, including reproductive health, family planning, and selected
nutrition interventions, as the best strategy
to provide universal access to essential health
services. ADB's overall objective in the health
subsector is to assist DMC governments in
ensuring that their citizens have broad access
to basic preventive, promotive, and curative
services. ADB focuses on (i) improving the
health status of the poor, women, infants,
children, and indigenous peoples; (ii) promoting health sector reforms; (iii) enhancing the
efficiency of health subsector investments
through institutional strengthening and capacity building; (iv) achieving tangible, measurable results; and (v) testing innovative

In Indonesia, the $300 million Health and
Nutrition Sector Development Program focused
on ensuring continued availability of basic health,
nutrition, and family planning services to those
most at risk: pregnant women, new mothers,
infants, and young children. Emphasis was placed
on strengthening service delivery through health
centers and community health posts. The Program
supports broad health subsector reforms to
mobilize additional resources and improve efficiency, sustainability, and transparency through
decentralization. Government budget allocations
are provided directly to health centers in proportion to the number of poor and vulnerable groups
covered by each health center. In the Marshall
Islands, health care services will be improved for
one fourth of the national population through
implementation of the $9.3 million Ebeye Health
and Infrastructure project. In Pakistan, a $47 million loan for the Women's Health project will
expand health and nutrition programs serving
poor rural women and children, develop "womanfriendly" health care systems, and improve district

approaches and supporting effective and affordable new technologies.

The Asian financial crisis highlighted the
need for governments to actively pursue health
subsector reform and implement effective and
cost-efficient strategies. Reforms in health
subsector financing aim to mobilize more resources for health and to make better use of
available resources, particularly government
subsidies. ADB projects support reforms that
further decentralize health service delivery, encourage partnerships with the private sector to
improve efficiency and coverage, and focus on
protecting vulnerable groups, especially the
poor, women, children, and indigenous peoples.

Decentralization allows greater participation of beneficiaries in identifying issues
and developing solutions, and requires closer
collaboration between ministries of health
and local governments. Many countries are

developing public-private partnerships in health
services delivery and ADB is actively promoting private sector participation. Besides mobilizing new financial resources, private sector
involvement in the health subsector helps
improve management and cost efficiency of services delivery and allows governments to better target subsidies to vulnerable groups
because the private sector takes charge of part
of the population. In several DMCs, health services are being contracted to nonprofit NGOs;
in others, services are contracted whereby, for
example, public sector personnel work in collaboration with the private sector to acquire
expertise in management and training.

ADB and water supply and sanitation: Providing safe and reliable drinking water and
appropriate sanitation facilities is an important
aspect of ADB's strategy to reduce poverty. ADB

Project will improve the environment, water
resource management, living conditions, and public health standards in the urban areas adjacent
to the creek. In Cambodia, a $20 million loan was
approved to support the Government's objectives
of human development and poverty reduction by
rehabilitating the water supply system in six towns

gender equity, and protecting the environment.
Participation of and consultation with affected
communities and NGOs in project planning,
design, and implementation are emphasized to
ensure commitment by stakeholders and action
that is socially acceptable and that reflects the
communities’ changing needs. To sustain project
benefits, ADB encourages private sector involvement in management and maintenance activities. Institutional and agency capacity building
is also supported to improve the efficiency of
delivery, operation and maintenance, financial
management, and cost recovery, for long-term
sustainability. For more on ADB's role in the water

ADB and urban development and housing:
Reducing the impact of poverty caused by rapid
urbanization is a major challenge facing DMCs.
Areturn to economic growth following the Asian
financial crisis, social development, and the
creation of better living conditions in urban
areas—all these depend on improving the quality, quantity, and efficiency of basic infrastructure and essential municipal services. The
willingness and ability of the population to pay
for services and the extent of private sector investment in urban infrastructure are vital factors that will determine the future level of
services provided in most DMCs.

ADB's main objectives in urban development and housing are (i) reducing urban poverty; (ii) lifting living standards in urban areas;
(iii) enhancing the quality of life, including
promoting human development and improving
the status of women; and (iv) achieving sustainable urban development by protecting the

DB approved three loans totaling $200 mil
lion in 1999 to assist the Government of
India in developing urban and environmental
infrastructure, meeting basic human needs, and
improving the quality of life of urban residents
by providing long-term funds to reform-oriented
municipal bodies, private sector project sponsors,
and microfinance institutions. An integrated
urban development project loan of $175 million
is helping Karnataka, India meet basic human
needs by developing urban services, building
capacity, and supporting community participation at the state and local levels. In Indonesia,
two ADB loans of $320 million are supporting
the Government's decentralization efforts, reducing poverty, and building the capacity of village
and district entities to prepare them for their new
responsibilities. In the Maldives, equitable development is being pursued under an $8 million loan
project through a regional effort in institutional,
infrastructure, and environmental improvement.
Tuvalu is being provided a $4 million loan to
support the Government's agenda to develop the
outer islands, including decentralization and
regional development, sustainable development
finance, private sector participation, and capacitybuilding assistance. In Viet Nam, ADB is supporting

environment. ADB supports urban development
projects that promote good governance through
decentralization of authority, responsibilities,
and resources from central to local government units, improved urban management,
community participation, and partnerships
with the private sector. Support is provided
to improve urban management through institutional strengthening and capacity building. ADB also encourages mobilizing financial
resources by promoting fiscal autonomy,
direct cost recovery, and market-based pricing of services. Emphasis is placed on reducing urban poverty by strengthening gender
equity, improving access to microcredit, and
developing partnerships between all levels of
government and the community. Urban
development includes projects on integrated
urban development, water supply and sanitation, solid waste management, urban transport, and urban housing.

n 1999, through a regional technical assistance,
ADB placed locally recruited gender specialists
in its resident missions in Bangladesh, Indonesia,
Nepal, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam. The
objectives of the technical assistance are to
(i) provide support that will build the gender and

development (GAD) capacity of developing member country (DMC) project executing agencies,
(ii) improve the quality of implementation of ADBfinanced loans and technical assistance addressing
gender concerns, and (iii) expand the scope of ADB
activities in the area of GAD at the country level.

Improving the status of women

With the adoption of poverty reduction as ADB's
main goal, attention to improving the status of
women is heightened. The majority of the poor
in the region are women. This fact necessitates
approaches that involve not only policy changes
but also investments in women across all sectors. Increased investments that provide women
with access to education, primary health services, and income and employment opportunities form the basis of ADB interventions.

In many societies, women suffer disproportionately from the burden of poverty and are
systematically excluded from access to resources, essential services, and decision
making. Yet, women contribute to the economy
and to combating poverty through both remunerative work in the economy and unpaid work
in the care of the home and community. Providing economic opportunities and improving
the incomes of poor women is, therefore, a
critical and effective strategy for reducing poverty. Public policies and investments that
promote women's economic and social status
foster higher economic growth rates and simultaneously attack poverty. Pro-poor economic
growth, human development, and good governance—the key ingredients for poverty reduction—are intrinsically linked and dependent on
improvements in women's economic, social,
and political empowerment.

In 1999, ADB's activities focused on implementing the revised Policy on Gender and
Development. A GAD Action Plan was drafted,

The gender specialists primarily assist in
administering GAD aspects of ADB-assisted loans
and technical assistance to mainstream gender
in selected projects . The gender specialists assist
ADB programming and selected project missions
in integrating gender considerations into those
operations and provide gender capacity building
and training to host-country executing agencies
and resident mission staff. They also facilitate
communication on gender issues among ADB,
DMC governments, external funding agencies,
and nongovernment organizations.Operational Priorities

37

 

additional gender specialists were recruited at
headquarters, local gender specialists were fielded
in six of ADB's resident missions, sectoral gender
checklists were prepared, a manual on best practices was drafted, and preparations commenced
for establishing an external forum on gender.

The gender and development policy adopts
mainstreaming as a key strategy in promoting
gender equity. Examples of gender mainstreaming can be found in all aspects of ADB
operations, including infrastructure, resettlement, agriculture, forestry and natural resource
management, microfinance, and the social sectors, including education, health, and water
supply and sanitation.

Several loan and technical assistance
projects in 1999 addressed gender issues. ADB's
study of rural Asia emphasizes the need to
analyze gender as a crosscutting issue and to
support activities that improve women's access
to social infrastructure, services, improved
employment and income-earning opportunities,
and participation in decision making and in
community-based organizations. Technical

everal projects approved in 1999 had gender
components.

India's Karnataka Urban Development and
Coastal Environmental Management Project will
address the complex issues of gender and poverty,
alcoholism, domestic violence, sexual abuse of
women and girls, women's lack of organization,
and women's lack of access to decision making.

related to women's ownership of and access to
land; their participation in new producer organizations; and their access to training, credit, and
markets. The Project seeks to monitor closely the
patterns of women's ownership of and access to
land under current reforms.

assistance provided in the Greater Mekong
Subregion addresses gender issues related to
the vulnerability of women to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and the particular problems faced by ethnic minority women in accessing educational opportunities and health
services. Technical assistance to Sri Lanka on
Protected Area Management and Wildlife
Conservation analyzes the gender-based constraints that women face in participating in forest
management and food production. It attempts to
involve women fully in land use planning and
decision making to avoid negative impacts on
their food production activities. The project also
looks at women's single/joint leasehold of stateowned lands for participatory forestry, and their
membership in community-based forest
management organizations.

Protecting the environment

Since the historic Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro
in 1992, ADB has been aggressively responding

Pakistan's Punjab Farmer-Managed Irrigation
Project attempts to provide culturally appropriate
tools for addressing gender inequality in irrigation
management-related decision making. The Project
provides for the formation of women's groups at
the village level, which will communicate women's
water-related concerns to the male-dominated
farmer associations. The Project will fill a serious
strategic gap in women's relative participation in
decision making by providing women with the
knowledge necessary to participate in water use
planning, allocation, and management.

The Sri Lanka Skills Development Project
addresses concerns related to gender tracking
in technical and vocational education, which
lead to high rates of unemployment and low
incomes among women. The Project addresses
these issues by including measures for providing labor market information to potential trainees, new kinds of skills development for women,
private sector participation in skills identification and certification, and finance for women
trainees wishing to start their own enterprises.38

to the escalating demand from its DMCs for assistance in environmental management. Over
the years, ADB's environment agenda has
evolved from impact mitigation to impact prevention, and has expanded to cover environmental integration into country operations, and
sector and macro policy work, along with targeted interventions in loan projects to achieve
direct environmental benefits. ADB and its
partners have achieved significant progress; but
considering the magnitude of environmental
issues, the impact of these programs on broad
environmental trends throughout Asia and the
Pacific has been less than what was hoped for
in Rio. ADB's decision to make poverty reduction its overarching objective strengthened its
environment agenda; moreover, it shifted its
environment program focus to support this
overarching objective.

Sound environmental management is critical to sustainable development, and as a consequence, to poverty reduction. Growth will be
short-lived if it does not conserve the natural
environment and its resources. Although much
of the past damage has been caused by powerful
vested interests, the pressures of poverty and
population can compound the problem through
deforestation, overgrazing, and overfishing. The
rural poor are often forced to live on fragile
lands and near-fragile waters that require sensitive resource management in the face of increasing degradation. The urban poor are
exposed to diseases and illnesses resulting from
overcrowding, inadequate basic services, and

Protecting the Environment

n 1999, ADB approved nine loan projects

for nearly $1 billion to improve the environment and conserve natural resources. Two
projects in the People’s Republic of China had
primary environmental objectives, including a
rehabilitation project for the Suzhou Creek to
improve water quality and flood control and a

loan in Shanxi Province to help solve air pollution
problems in three cities. A $40 million loan to
Sri Lanka will address the problem of coastal

polluted living conditions. To address poverty,
itis important to empower the poor and to give
them a stake in managing the environment and
natural resources.

In addition to targeting interventions to
achieve direct environmental benefits in loan
projects and programs (see box below), ADB
continued to mainstream environmental considerations in country operational strategy studies, sector policies, and into its loan and
investment projects and programs. It also ensured that environmental impacts of projects
and programs were reviewed, and that prevention, abatement, and mitigation measures were
incorporated. Where appropriate, environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and summary
EIAs were circulated for review by stakeholders, who were also encouraged to participate
in implementing environmental management
plans. Better ways of reviewing and monitoring projects from identification to postevaluation were adopted to ensure quality at
entry and quality of supervision.

One recently completed activity in support
of this objective is the updating of ADB's 1986
environmental guidelines for use in preparing
initial environmental examination reports. A
peer review process to improve the quality of
EIA reports involving Environment Network
members was initiated. A study of several loan
projects was conducted to determine the effectiveness of ADB project implementation
procedures for environmental compliance
monitoring. Further, recognizing the limited

value of EIAs in dealing with impacts of various initiatives other than projects, ADB conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of
strategic environmental assessment in dealing
with the cumulative and indirect impacts, and
large-scale effects generated by these nonproject initiatives.

In 1999, ADB continued to assist DMCs to
improve their capability in environmental planning and management through technical assistance grants (see box below).

In addition to helping address countryspecific environmental problems, ADB addressed environmental issues common to
several DMCs at regional and subregional levels. These efforts were realized in cooperation
with bilateral funding agencies and international organizations. Transboundary environmental issues addressed through ADB technical
assistance included climate change, acid rain
in northeast Asia, and the impact of atmospheric
haze brought about by forest fires in the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN). The ASEAN Regional Strategy
for Haze Prevention and Mitigation is an output
of ADB assistance. ADB's technical assistance
resulted in part in a transboundary haze pollution web site (http:/Awww.haze-online.or.id),
which acts as an information clearinghouse, as
well as facilitates coordination and monitoring
of national, regional, and international initiatives with institutions in the region on programs
for preventing and mitigating forest fires and
transboundary haze pollution. In the Greater

n 1999, ADB continued to support its DMCs'

efforts to strengthen their institutional capacity.
For example, in the People’s Republic of China,
technical assistance included preparing a project

Mekong Subregion, a Working Group on
Environment, supported by ADB technical assistance, continued to lead cooperative efforts
among participating countries in addressing
common environmental issues.

ADB also addressed the issue of climate
change in cooperation with other organizations.
In collaboration with the Hans Seidel Foundation, International Union for the Conservation
of Nature, and United Nations Environment
Programme, ADB conducted a capacitybuilding regional workshop on implementing
the Kyoto Protocol and the Clean Development
Mechanism for representatives of 17 DMCs.

ADB continued major regional technical
assistance designed to enhance existing
national and regional capabilities to develop
least-cost greenhouse gas abatement strategies
that promote environmentally sustainable economic development in several countries in the
region. The project—funded by ADB, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) through the
United Nations Development Programme, and the
Norwegian Government— resulted in a 13-volume
study outlining an Asia Least-Cost Greenhouse
Gas Abatement Strategy (see box on page 40).

In 1999, using a more streamlined approach to access GEF grant resources, ADB
pursued new opportunities for partnership with
GEF. The policy, adopted by GEF in May 1999
on Expanded Opportunities for Regional Development Banks, allows ADB to blend its own
resources for sustainable development at the
country level with GEF grant resources allocated

project. In Sri Lanka, an ADB technical assistance
supported sustainable natural resource management for developing and preparing a protected
area management and wildlife conservation
project. In Viet Nam, ADB approved a study on
the policy and institutional framework for forest
resources management. It also assisted India,
Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam
in developing the policy and institutional framework for integrating cleaner production
principles as a priority element in national
environmental and industrial development
strategies.40

to address global environmental issues. This
approach enables ADB to deliver new and
greener products to its clients on more attractive lending terms. In 1999, five ADB project
concepts entered the GEF pipeline, and four GEF
grants were approved to help formulate
components of ADB projects being prepared.

ADB continued to promote environmental awareness among DMC officials and ADB
staff members through workshops, seminars,
conferences, and forums. Several publications
were prepared, including Mobilizing Broader

Law and policy reform

Law and policy reform lies at the heart of good
governance in supporting the legal and institutional framework for predictability, transparency, accountability, and participation. Over the
years, ADB has provided substantial assistance
through loan and technical assistance projects
with significant law and policy reform components. Stand-alone legal technical assistance
has focused on law and policy reform for private

The Project found that in 1990 the 11 participating countries, which have about half of the
population of the world, accounted for 12 percent of all global carbon dioxide-equivalent
emissions, estimated at 37,050 teragrams. Other
developing countries accounted for 31 percent

sector development, particularly for finance,
banking, and corporate governance; judicial reform, legal training; dissemination of legal
information, and environmental protection. ADB
has supported more than 300 projects with
substantial law and policy reform components,
more than 100 of which have been completed.
Also, 45 stand-alone technical assistance
projects have been processed and administered.
Combined, these have promoted a systemic
approach to legal reform, supported by training of lawyers and judicial officers and dissemination of legal information.

In 1999, ADB continued to pursue its law
and policy reform program by establishing and
building the capacity of legal and regulatory
systems of its DMCs. To support ADB's main
goal of poverty reduction, work began in 1999
on the project Poverty and the Law: Strengthening Access to Justice. The project's primary
objective is to compile a knowledge base on
the access of people with very low incomes to
the justice systems in four DMCs; assess the
legal and judicial institutional constraints to
participation by the poor in economic and social
activities; and identify the need for reform in
the law and policy-making institutions in these
DMCs, and strategic points for reforms to promote access to justice. The ultimate goal is to
develop policy-oriented strategies and actions

and the rest of the world for 57 percent. If the
number of zero or negative abatement cost
measures identified in the Project are fully
implemented, these could reduce greenhouse gas
emissions from the 11 countries by approximately
one third of their projected “business-as-usual”
emissions in 2020. More aggressive but low
abatement cost measures could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the projections even
further in many of the participating countries.
The Project developed 81 project briefs including regional project proposals for climate change
vulnerability and adaptation assessment. Perhaps
the most significant product of the effort was creating capacity within each of the countries to analyze
and deal with the many challenges of sustainable
development that arise from greenhouse gases.Operational Priorities

to protect and promote the welfare of the poor
in the DMCs concerned.

Governance issues have also been addressed in government agencies and the social
sectors. In Indonesia alone, three program loans
were provided in 1999 with substantial law and
policy reform components aimed at good governance. The Community and Local Government
Support Sector Development Program involved
drafting and enacting the regional law for
devolving administrative authority and the law
on intergovernmental fiscal relations for devolving fiscal authority and rationalizing revenue
sharing between different government levels.
The Health and Nutrition Sector Development
Program will prepare an integrated proposal to
update and rationalize the legal and regulatory
frameworks for decentralized health care financing, delivery, and management. The Power
Sector Restructuring Program provides for the
promulgation of a new electricity law, allowing
an independent regulatory body for market
oversight to be established. Technical assistance
is also being provided to Indonesia to establish an independent anticorruption commission.
An important component of this technical assistance will be vigorous public dissemination
and consultations on the purposes of the commission and related anticorruption legislation.
In Mongolia, the Governance Reform Program

echnical assistance for legal and judicial
reform supported a diagnostic study of the
legal system in Pakistan. The broad-based, processoriented study reflects two interrelated
objectives of identifying the most pressing needs

work under a previously approved technical
assistance to Pakistan on legal and judicial reform
was completed, and is expected to lead to ADB's
first stand-alone loan to a DMC for judicial and
legal reform (see box below).

In Tajikistan, ADB is assisting in establishing the Law Reform Commission, disseminating laws, and training Tajik lawyers. A
multicountry study involving Bangladesh,
Indonesia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Philippines,
Thailand, and Viet Nam was also approved to
identify best practices for delivering legal literacy at the grassroot level and to the administrators of laws, and to incorporate such
practices into ADB-funded projects. This will
promote access to the judicial system, which
in turn should enhance participatory processes, accountability, and good governance.
Another multicountry study, approved in
1999, will identify the principal causes of
court congestion in DMCs and propose appropriate solutions. ADB is developing Project
DIAL—Development of the Internet for Asian
Law—to assist those involved in developing
legislation in DMCs. Project DIAL will make
available on the Internet the full texts of
legislation, regulations, and related law
reform reports to legislative drafters and law

changes in incentives and reporting structures
that will improve judicial performance and accountability; alleviation of delay and human resource
constraints; and the financing of the judiciary to

DMC users may access expert panelists from
different countries to discuss law-related topics.

ADB is also promoting women's legal equality through education, labor, health, financial,
and infrastructure reforms, and through the
provision of regional and national support for
legal awareness and training programs to sensitize policymakers, lawyers, members of the
judiciary, law enforcement personnel, and
members of the community at large on the legal
status of women. Pursuant to the regional
echnical assistance, Sociolegal Status of
Women in Selected Developing Member Counries, country reports have been prepared for
ndonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand.

In the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis,
attention was focused on issues of governance in
he finance sector. ADB provided assistance for
finance sector reform through loans and technical assistance to its DMCs, including the People’s
Republic of China (PRC), Indonesia, Lao People’s
Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Thailand, and Viet
Nam. Assistance has been provided for preparing
securities laws; creating collateral security regisration systems; and amending insolvency laws,
accounting laws, corporate governance, and capial market supervision regulations.

In 1999, ADB approved a financial intermediation and resource mobilization program loan
0 the Kyrgyz Republic, whose finance sector is
being transformed in the shift from a command
economy to an increasingly market-driven

 

economy. Legal and regulatory reforms will be
put in place to ensure transparency and disclosure norms for listed companies and the securities market, thereby instituting sound governance
practices in the corporate sector. The regulatory
framework for the insurance sector will also be
strengthened and a new public debt law prepared.
Resource mobilization is being supported through
assistance to Bhutan, PRC, and Uzbekistan for
reviewing legal frameworks relating to pension
fund schemes and insurance; to PRC, Indonesia,
and Viet Nam for secured lending; and to
Uzbekistan and Vanuatu for establishing the regulatory frameworks for rural savings mobilization
and for establishing savings and credit unions.

As a result of another ADB technical assistance, Viet Nam has enacted the Decree on
Secured Transactions, which enables the granting of security interests on both present and
future assets to secure the performance of any
civil, economic, or commercial obligation. A
decree on the registration of securities will soon
accompany this decree, providing a measure of
certainty in secured transactions. Broader
issues in the legal and regulatory frameworks—
relating to capital market institutions in the
context of finance sector reform, financial market development, and financial management strategies—are being addressed in Papua New Guinea
and Viet Nam. ADB has facilitated the discussion
on issues of insolvency and secured transactions
in Asia and the Pacific through two regional technical assistance projects (see box below).

Secured Transactions and Insolvency: A Framework for Efficient Resource Use

n 1999, ADB held a two-part symposium on

Secured Transactions Law Reform and Insolvency Law Reform under two technical assistance
grants approved in 1998. The joint symposium
highlighted the important relationship between
these two legal areas and the need for an integrated approach to reform.

During the Secured Transactions Law Reform
Symposium, participants discussed the key role
of collateral in countries with private markets in
allowing private businesses and financial
institutions to lend and sell on credit, positing
secured lending as a vital component of debt
financing.

 

The Asian financial crisis illuminated the lack
of frameworks in many DMCs for the systematic
restructuring of debt and the efficient liquidation
of businesses incapable of being restructured. As
a first step to facilitate the development of sound
legal frameworks to address these problems, ADB
carried out studies of the insolvency regimes in
11 Asian economies. The studies have been
published on http://www.insolvencyasia.com.
At the Insolvency Law Reform Symposium,
participants discussed the studies, reviewed
common problems in insolvency law reform,
and explored regional and international best
practices.Operational Priorities

 

Human resource development is fundamental to the successful implementation of law
and policy reform. A major focus of ADB's legal
technical assistance is on strengthening legal
capacity in its DMCs. In Bangladesh, technical
assistance was approved for training lawyers
of energy sector executing agencies in understanding and applying new regulations. In 1999,
ADB approved technical assistance for strengthening legal education and judicial training in
the Maldives. In Vanuatu, the institutional and
professional capacity within the State Law Office
was strengthened. Also in 1999, under an
ongoing technical assistance in Viet Nam,
500 lawyers upgraded their knowledge of
recent commercial legislation and market
economy legal principles and their practical
legal skills. The reaction to the participatory
training techniques and case study method
has been so enthusiastic that these teaching
methods are being adopted at the Hanoi Law
University.

Technical assistance is being provided to
establish education, training, and professional
development for judicial service personnel in
the Pacific DMCs. In 1999, ADB approved a
regional technical assistance to improve the
delivery of government services in six DMCs.
Particular emphasis will be placed on analysis
of incentive systems and opportunities for
contracting with the private sector to provide
such services. Following earlier assistance, ADB
also approved technical assistance for training
government officials in legal issues arising in
private sector infrastructure development in
Bangladesh, PRC, and Viet Nam.

ADB's law and policy reform program has
significantly influenced projects addressing the
key objectives of improving the environment;
two ongoing projects are in the PRC and India.
Moreover, many of ADB's natural resource- and
infrastructure-related projects have environmental protection components supported
through the reform of environment-related laws
and establishment of appropriate regulatory
frameworks. Many technical assistance projects
were approved in 1999 that directly address
environment and natural resource conservation
and management issues. In the PRC's Shanxi
Province, for example, ADB is supporting a legal

framework for introducing market-based
instruments for controlling air pollution. A
series of technical assistance projects is
addressing issues relating to the legal and
regulatory frameworks and procedures for enforcing river basin management, managing
wastewater and controlling pollution, recovering costs in the water resource sector, and
reviewing the environmental protection legislation at national and local levels in Bangladesh,
PRC, Fiji Islands, India, Indonesia, and several
other DMCs. The Office of the General Counsel
also supported a study of environmental principles and concepts reflecting international law
and public policy. This study will be published
in 2000 as a book entitled Multilateral Development Banking: Environmental Principles and
Concepts Reflecting General International Law
and Public Policy.

Supporting regional cooperation

ADB fosters economic growth and cooperation
in the region, collectively and individually, and
uses its resources for financing development
in the region, giving priority to regional, subregional, and national projects and programs
that will contribute most effectively to the region
as a whole. ADB also assists its DMCs in making their economies more complementary.
Under its policy supporting regional cooperation, approved in 1994, ADB has provided considerable support through regional technical
assistance and complementary project investment in national infrastructure to promote and
realize cooperation among its DMCs (see box
on pages 44 and 45). More recently, ADB's
Regional Economic Monitoring Unit (see box on
this Unit in the Corporate Planning chapter)
initiated the process of regional economic
monitoring to complement economic and financial surveillance at national and global levels.

Cooperation among DMCs can contribute
to poverty reduction and equitable development. Less-developed economies, particularly
small ones, face significant supply-and-demand
limitations that result in misuse of resources
(e.g., lack of division of labor) and slow growth
(fewer opportunities for mobilizing investment44

ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

and expanding output), which in turn impose
a loss of welfare. In this context, cooperation
can help reduce or remove the limitations and
make countries realize potential gains in welfare. For economies or sectors that have not
faced significant external demand, cooperation
in the form of economic integration can lead to
fuller and more stable employment through
export growth. Similarly, while liberalization of
factor markets can make labor in former importsubstitution industries redundant, imports can
be factors of production directed at export
industries, thereby further enhancing their
international competitiveness, and expanding
growth and demand for labor.

With expanded trade, investment, and
specialization come new technologies and
skills. Both wages and returns to capital should
rise because of higher productivity. Even in
small, less-developed but open economies,
individuals and households frequently employ
both labor and capital (e.g., farmers and small
traders that compete in free markets). In this
context, a marginal increase in family income
generally increases consumption and savings
for all members of the family, including women
and children, and may well include more
expenditure on merit goods, such as education.

ADB's and its DMCs' interests in cooperation are not confined to cooperation in trade
and investment. Many neighboring countries
share common resources, which, if not jointly
managed, may result in disadvantages to the
poor, who often use common natural resources
for their livelihood. If the scale and quality of

"reater Mekong Subregion: Economic

J cooperation within the Greater Mekong
Subregion (GMS), with a population of nearly
240 million, was initiated by ADB in 1992. From
the beginning, ADB has performed the role of
facilitator, catalyst, and honest broker.

The GMS Program has accomplished much
in the past eight years. The process of subregional
cooperation has been institutionalized, and a
framework of cooperation in eight priority sectors has been established. Two important road
projects—the Phnom Penh-Ho Chi Minh City Road

those resources diminish or deteriorate, so does
the poor's access to economic resources. Weak
economic interaction across national borders
means that cross-border externalities of national
economic activity are ignored, as no economic
incentive exists to consider them. For negative
externalities, the possibility of retaliatory practices
increases; in the case of positive externalities,
economic benefits are foregone. In both cases,
resources are misallocated. If corrected through
cooperation, the realized economic benefits and
more stable conditions—even if marginal—are
important to the poor.

In addition to economic benefits, sustained
cooperation among neighboring countries builds
interdependence and trust, which are effective
means of minimizing conflict. This can reduce
costs of maintaining borders as a part of government expenditure, leaving more money available
for public and merit goods for the poor.

Private sector development

Support for private sector development is an
integral part of ADB's poverty reduction strategy. Development of a strong and dynamic
private sector is crucial to long-term, rapid
economic growth, a necessary condition for
sustained poverty reduction. ADB uses a range
of instruments and advice to help address problems that impede private sector growth in its
DMCs. Through its public sector operations,
ADB supports DMC governments in creating
enabling conditions for business; while through

Project and the East-West Corridor Project, have
recently started.

Trade Cooperation among People's Republic of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and
Uzbekistan: ADB is encouraging cooperation
among the governments through a regional
technical assistance project. The four governments
are identifying and prioritizing development
projects that will increase trade and other types
of economic cooperation among themselves and
with neighboring trading partners.Operational Priorities

its private sector operations, it catalyzes private investments that deliver developmental
impacts and/or demonstrational effects.

Creating enabling conditions

Supporting policy reform: In 1999, ADB continued to pursue public sector initiatives aimed at
improving the enabling environment for the
private sector. In most cases, reforms are
needed at the macro and sector levels before
assistance can be provided to individual private
sector projects, such as in the energy and transport sectors. For example, a loan approved for
India's largest state, Madhya Pradesh, supports
a program of reforms to improve public finances
and strengthen the policy, regulatory, and
institutional frameworks for private sector participation in infrastructure.

Another example is a loan to Pakistan in
support of the Government's program for trade
liberalization, export promotion, and industrial
reform. The program seeks to rationalize tariffs, remove nontariff barriers, improve the
availability of export credit, diversify export
products, introduce a system of export insurance, strengthen the infrastructure policy, and
privatize manufacturing enterprises in strategic sectors. The program is further enhanced
with technical assistance loans for modernizing customs administration, institutional support for the trade regime, and institutional
strengthening of the investment board.

Developing financial markets: Wellfunctioning financial systems are needed to

ADB recently supported a workshop on the
trade cooperation issues associated with the
planned highway rehabilitation.

Tajikistan, which shares many of the same
development challenges as its neighbors, will be
participating in ADB's activities in support of

regional cooperation in Central Asia.
Subregional Cooperation in South Asia:
ADB support for subregional cooperation in South
Asia since 1996 has focused on Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India (especially east and northeastern

promote the private sector. Many DMCs need
o strengthen their financial institutions and
create diversified financial markets to develop
he domestic capacity to finance private sectored growth. In a financially integrated world,
robust and well-regulated banking systems and
inancial markets, coupled with sound macroeconomic management, are necessary to reduce
he risk of instability associated with sudden
outflows of short-term capital. One advantage
of the region is that many DMCs have substanial domestic saving that, if channeled through
well-functioning capital markets, could help the
private sector avoid excessive reliance on
external finance and the concomitant exposure
0 exchange risks.

In 1999, ADB continued to provide significant support for finance sector development in
a number of DMCs. For example, the PRC was
granted technical assistance to help the
Government undertake comprehensive reform
of the country's pension and insurance systems
with the objective of providing more secure and
higher retirement incomes for the elderly. The
reform program is also expected to lead to the
development of financial markets needed to
mobilize long-term saving for investment.
Thailand's finance sector reform was supported
with technical assistance for restructuring the
state-owned specialized financial institutions,
critical for restoring normal credit flows and
facilitating private sector-led growth. Technical assistance was granted to the Philippines
to develop and modernize the nonbank finance
sector, strengthen the securities regulatory

 

India), and Nepal. Considering the special
circumstances of the subregion, a project- or
activity-based approach is being pursued. As a
first major step, ADB is supporting the formation of the Private Sector Forum for Regional
Cooperation in the Eastern Region of South
Asia. ADB is assisting in preparing background
papers for a 2000 meeting, focusing on priority
areas for subregional cooperation such as trade
and investment, energy, transport, and water
resource management.46

authority, upgrade the prudential standards,
and develop money and capital markets. For
Bhutan, a technical assistance grant was
approved for strengthening banking supervision
by the central bank.

Improving infrastructure facilities. DMC
governments will continue to have a major role
in providing infrastructure needed to support
private sector investment. ADB loans to
Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia, and Nepal in
1999 were designed to help increase power supply for industry. At the same time, these loans
support sector reforms, including commercializing and privatizing power generation and
distribution, and, in the case of Indonesia, restructuring the sector to establish a competitive market for electricity. ADB loans were also extended
to several DMCs in 1999 for constructing new
roads and improving existing ones to cut transport time and cost, give producers better access
to markets for their products, and provide links
to ports for shipping.

Private sector participation in partnership
with the public sector can facilitate financing,
construction, and operation of infrastructure
facilities; improve efficiency; deliver muchneeded services cost-effectively; and release
resources from public budgets at all levels. ADB
assists DMC governments create enabling conditions for private sector participation in areas
such as energy, and transport and communications. ADB also helps establish an effective
regulatory framework to encourage private
sector participation in infrastructure and to
build the capacity of regulatory agencies. Technical assistance, such as the one approved for

he ADB-financed Chengdu Water Project in the
capital city of Sichuan Province, People's
Republic of China (PRC), won two awards for
excellence in project finance in 1999 from two
internationally recognized financial publications.
The London-based Project Finance International

cited the Project as the "Infrastructure Deal of the
Year," while the Hong Kong-based Financial
Intelligence Agency voted it as the "Project Finance
Deal of the Year." The awards were given in recognition of the Project's innovative and superior

the Philippines in 1999, is also provided to assist
local government units in preparing local
infrastructure projects for private sector financing. ADB ensures that the process of transferring infrastructure responsibilities to the private
sector is transparent and competitive, and
produces greater efficiencies and better service
to consumers.

Developing human resources skills:
Availability of skilled human resources is an important condition for the private sector to flourish in any DMC. To assist Papua New Guinea,
which faces a major crisis of labor absorption,
ADB extended a loan in 1999 for developing job
skills training for more than 40,000 people, especially women and young men. Technical,
managerial, financial, and entrepreneurial training will be delivered by NGOs, vocational training centers, and private training institutions. A
similar private sector skills development program was developed for Sri Lanka, with a loan
from ADB, to prepare over 100,000 young
school dropouts for jobs in the construction,
insurance, real estate, transport and communications, and manufacturing industries.

Financing microenterprises: Microfinance
is an important tool for promoting small-scale
entrepreneurial development. In 1999, ADB
initiated several projects to expand microfinance services in its DMCs. A regional microfinance strategy was developed under a
technical assistance grant designed to carry out
in-country consultations in 12 countries, conduct regional workshops, and recommend how
DMC governments can promote microfinance
institutions. In rural Cambodia, ADB assisted

in establishing procedures for licensing and
supervising NGOs and strengthen the technical capabilities for sound financial management.
In August 1999, ADB supported the Women's
World Banking (WWB) Asia Regional Meeting
and the Best Practice Workshop for Microfinance Practitioners. These twin events were
attended by leaders and members of WWB
microfinance affiliates in Asia that offer access
to finance, information, and markets to poor
women entrepreneurs in Asia.

Catalyzing private investments

In ADB's private sector operations, 1999 saw
the approval of four infrastructure projects
involving financing commitments of $153.9 million, comprising $7.4 million of equity investment and $146.5 million of long-term loans
without government guarantees. These projects
also involved cofinancing commitments from
commercial banks amounting to $187.5 million
in complementary loans. ADB's participation in
these projects catalyzed a total of $1.4 billion
worth of investment commitments for
development.

Bulk water supply: The first private sector
project approved by ADB in 1999 involves a loan
to Chengdu Générale des Eaux-Marubeni
Waterworks Co. Ltd., a French-Japanese joint
venture, for the bulk supply of treated water to
the capital city of Sichuan Province in the PRC
under an 18-year contract. Chengdu is one of

a model for build-operate-transfer (BOT) water
supply projects in the PRC. Through a technical
assistance to the Chengdu Municipal Government, ADB helped ensure that the basic
elements of transparent bidding were observed,
that the lowest tariff was obtained, and that

the project fundamentals, such as regular tariff
increases to enable cost recovery, were in place.
ADB was instrumental in structuring the financing for the Project. Besides its own direct loan, ADB
helped secure funding commitments from seven

the 108 cities classified by the PRC Government
as having serious water shortages. This was the
first build-operate-transfer (BOT) water supply
project in the PRC and was developed with the
assistance of ADB to serve as a model for similar projects in other areas of the country. The
Chengdu Water Project, which won two international awards for excellence in project finance
in 1999 (see box on page 46 and below), was
the first infrastructure project supported by ADB
that relied on a subsovereign undertaking.
Container terminal: The second private
sector project was in Sri Lanka, involving equity
and debt financing for South Asia Gateway
Terminals (Pvt) Ltd., which is jointly sponsored
by a local conglomerate and an international
shipping group, to expand the container facilities in the port of Colombo. The Project can be

commercial banks under its complementary financing scheme, and secured a guarantee facility from
the European Investment Bank.

The Chengdu Water Project was ADB's first
private sector water project. It was also the first BOT
water supply project in the PRC, placing it in a
position to serve as a model for similar projects in
the country's water supply sector. The Project also
demonstrated that BOT water supply projects could
be structured at the municipal level and funded
without any central government guarantee.48

considered a significant achievement for
Sri Lanka. It was the first BOT project to be
implemented in the country, and it demonstrated to the financial community that project
finance is feasible in Sri Lanka. In addition, upon
its completion, the Project will enable Colombo
to compete with Asia's leading ports, thereby
leading to increased economic growth in
Colombo and the region. Sri Lankan and other
South Asian importers and exporters will benefit
from more efficient facilities that are expected
to reduce transport and logistical costs.

Water and sewerage concession: The third
private sector project, approved in 1999, was
the 25-year concession awarded to Maynilad
Water Services, Inc. for the financing, development, operation, and maintenance of the water
and sewerage facilities in the western half of
Metro Manila in the Philippines. Maynilad, a
joint venture between a local infrastructure
group and an international water operator
based in France, was one of the two concessionaires of the privatized operations of the
government-owned water and sewerage utility
for the area. ADB's loan to the Project will form
part of the debt package being raised to meet
the financing requirements of the concession
for the first five years of operation. Over the
life of the concession, Maynilad will rehabilitate the existing water system to reduce leaks,
stop illegal usage, and expand water and
sewerage service coverage.

The Maynilad Project will improve the
efficiency of water distribution in the concession area, enabling Maynilad to supply water
at lower prices than before. The required
expansion of service coverage will extend water
supply to presently unconnected households
and promote productivity. For the depressed
communities, Maynilad will provide water via
public standpipes at lower-than-average
tariffs. It is expected that 90,000 poor families will benefit from this program. The
increased sewerage service coverage and the
introduction of septic tank sanitation service
will improve public health and benefit the
environment by reducing the degradation of
groundwater and surface water.

International airport terminal: The fourth
private sector project involves the construction

and operation of a third international airport
terminal in Manila to be undertaken on a BOT
basis by Philippine International Air Terminals
Co. Inc. (PIATCO) under a 25-year concession.
The Project will replace the existing International Passenger Terminal I and provide a
modern and efficient airport terminal essential
for the Manila international airport to continue
serving a substantial part of the international
traffic to and from the Philippines. PIATCO is
a joint venture among Philippine, German, and
Japanese entities.

Social dimensions of
development

ADB assigns great importance to the social
dimensions of development. Social development is central to reducing poverty, fostering
socioeconomic development, and improving the
welfare and quality of life for people. ADB's
strategies and operations recognize that people
must be at the center of development, and that
to be effective and sustainable, development
initiatives must serve the interests, needs, and
aspirations of the people they address. Social
development centers on a set of specific crosscutting and multifaceted operational policies
and approaches. In 1999, progress was made
in the areas of indigenous peoples, involuntary
resettlement, and participatory approaches to
development.

Indigenous peoples: ADB recognizes the
potential vulnerability of indigenous peoples in
development interventions. Its policy on
indigenous peoples, adopted in 1998, provides
that ADB-assisted development interventions
will ensure that affected peoples are at least as
well-off as they would have been in the absence
of an intervention and that appropriate and
acceptable compensation is provided for any
negative impact that cannot be avoided. The
policy ensures that interventions are (i) consistent with the needs and aspirations of
affected peoples; (ii) compatible in substance
and structure with affected peoples’ cultural,
social, and economic institutions; and (iii) conceived, planned, and implemented with the
informed participation of affected communities.Operational Priorities

49

 

In 1999, ADB established a full-time staff
position in its Social Development Division to
monitor and guide matters related to indigenous
peoples in ADB operations. In addition, through
the same division, ADB is identifying project
initiatives that have addressed indigenous
peoples' concerns directly.

Two ongoing regional technical assistance projects in the Greater Mekong Subregion are directly addressing poverty and
health concerns of indigenous peoples. In
1999, work began on developing information
resources related to indigenous peoples. ADB
has taken several steps toward cooperating
and networking with other development institutions, funding agencies, and indigenous
peoples’ organizations.

Involuntary resettlement: Involuntary
resettlement activities in ADB dealt with the
impact of development projects. ADB avoids
unnecessary resettlement losses, and aims to
ensure that project-affected persons are as
well-off with an ADB-financed project as
without it. ADB's Policy on Involuntary
Resettlement, approved in 1995, was reviewed
in 1999 to address policy weaknesses and to
ensure that planning arrangements related to
the policy reflect ADB's goal of poverty
reduction and requirements for resettlement
consultation and disclosure.

A major capacity-building initiative was
begun in 1999 with regional technical assistance
to Bangladesh, PRC, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan,
Philippines, and Viet Nam. The technical assistance is evaluating the adequacy of national
resettlement policies and legal frameworks and
reviewing experiences in ongoing ADB-financed

ork on technical assistance to the People’s

Republic of China was begun in 1999, to
build capacity of national and provincial agencies
in conducting socioeconomic assessment for development investments, including resettlement.

In India, a technical assistance was approved

specific focus on resettlement and gender. A

projects. Several DMCs are now moving toward
drafting national resettlement policies or government decrees that will address issues related
to land acquisition and resettlement.

ADB's Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide
to Good Practice, first published in 1998, has
been translated into Bahasa Indonesia, Chinese,
and Russian. These translations offer a vehicle
for wider dissemination of good practice principles on resettlement and rehabilitation. An
electronic interactive version of the resettlement
guidelines was developed in 1999.

Participatory development: Participation
processes involve indirect stakeholders—
nongovernment and other civil society organizations, private sector, and others—that may
not be directly affected by an initiative but have
an interest in it. Governments are stakeholders
in development processes, as are development
institutions such as ADB.

To support participation and to follow on
a similar 1998 technical assistance, ADB
approved a regional technical assistance in 1999
to facilitate capacity-building and participatory
activities. The efficacy of its poverty reduction
efforts will be enhanced by promoting beneficiary and partner ownership of activities. The
technical assistance will create a readily accessible fund to support the use of timely and
innovative participatory approaches for involving DMC stakeholders in designing development
activities. In addition, ADB guidelines on
participation will be prepared, and good practices on participation in country strategy
development will be formulated.

ADB and nongovernment organizations: ADB
recognizes NGOs and civil society organizations

In Sri Lanka, a technical assistance was
approved to assist the Government in
developing an involuntary resettlement
policy.

In addition, in 1999 ADB provided training
on resettlement to ADB staff in headquarters
and at the resident missions as well as
numerous government staff in the DMCs.
Project-specific training for staff of executing
agencies was also undertaken.50

as significant partners in the development process and works to cooperate with NGOs to
strengthen the effectiveness, sustainability, and
quality of the development services ADB
provides.

ADB's current approaches to cooperation
with NGOs are reflected in the 1998 policy,
Cooperation Between the Asian Development
Bank and Nongovernment Organizations. These
approaches are a significant element of ADB's
poverty reduction strategy, and center on the
particular capacities of NGOs and the role they
play in development.

Operational sectors in which ADB and
NGOs have cooperated traditionally include
agriculture and rural development; urban
development and the provision of urban services
such as water supply and sanitation, health and
population, education and training; and provision of microcredit. Cooperation with NGOs is
increasingly being realized in other sectors as

NGOs and ADB in 1999

] n 1999, 25 of ADB's public sector project
approvals, or 52 percent, involved nongovernment organizations (NGOs) directly in some
significant way. A similar trend exists for technical
assistance operations. NGO involvement was
greatest in social sectors, agriculture and natural
resources, and transport and communications.
Countries with the most projects with NGO
involvement were India and Pakistan.

New approaches to cooperation were realized in loan project operations, in technical
assistance, and in opening new channels for
consultation and dialogue.

The Karnataka Urban Development and Coastal
Environmental Management Project in India involved
NGOs from the point of initial evaluation of the
project proposal, through the project feasibility
study, and into the development of project scope
and implementation arrangements. Poverty reducsUCoVaM (ATMEL Peo ame WN ccr-} Cola mol Mma (elKeXelgcxe
operations, will be initiated and run by local NGOs.

The Health and Nutrition Sector Development
Program in Indonesia, which will help mitigate
the effects of the financial crisis on the poor, will
involve NGOs at the village level. NGOs will
promote infant breast-feeding and appropriate
weaning practices, and distribute complementary

well, particularly in addressing social and
environmental impacts. NGOs are being consulted in upstream project development
activities for infrastructure and power projects,
such as feasibility studies and environmental
and social assessments, and are being engaged
as consultants in evaluation studies.
Cooperation with NGOs continues to
expand in country programming and other
country-level activities. Technical assistance to
support the strengthening of government-NGO
relationships is being implemented, processed,
or considered for several DMCs.
Consultation with NGOs is an important
aspect of ADB's policy development processes. As policies are developed, draft policy
documents are made available to NGOs for
review and comment. For example, in developing ADB's strategy on poverty reduction, a
series of country-level consultations was
held. ADB also maintains an ongoing process

foods for infants in defined high-risk areas. For
street and neglected children in selected urban
areas, NGOs will be engaged in managing open
houses and orphanages.

In Papua New Guinea, the EmploymentOriented Skills Development Project, designed to
contribute to the improvement of income-earning
and -generating opportunities for the unemployed
and underemployed, will develop a system of
support and strengthening for ongoing NGO
education and training programs.

Three regional technical assistance projects
relating to NGOs were approved in 1999. Capacity
Building Support to Nongovernment Organizations for Financial Resource Mobilization and
Management will develop training materials for
NGOs to use in identifying potential new funding
sources. The second technical assistance will help
identify priority needs in NGO capacity strengthening in Pacific DMCs, especially as NGOs assume
a larger role in development efforts. The Third

Operations
Resource transfers

The net transfer of resources! from ADB to its
DMCs decreased from $4.2 billion in 1998 to
$1.7 billion in 1999. For details, see Tables 2930 in the Statistical Annex.

Of the total net transfer, $925.3 million was
from ordinary capital resources (OCR) and
$793.7 million was from the Asian Development
Fund (ADF).

Loan disbursements reached $4.8 billion,
compared with $6.8 billion in 1998. For details,
see Table 14 in the Statistical Annex.

The 1999 disbursement ratio,” including
program loans, decreased to 22.2 percent from
29.3 percent in 1998.

By volume of net resource transfer,
Indonesia, PRC, India, and Thailand received
the largest net transfers from ADB.

Cofinancing and guarantee operations

ADB has been increasingly active in its efforts
to mobilize concessional funds for its poverty
reduction projects and commercial cofinancing
for its large infrastructure projects.

In 1999, cofinancing mobilized from all
sources amounted to $3.0 billion for
28 projects, equivalent to 61 percent of ADB's
total lending of $5.0 billion in 1999. This
represents a 2 percent increase over the
$2.9 billion achieved in 1998. Transport and
communications projects accounted for
37 percent of total cofinancing in 1999, social infrastructure for 32 percent, energy for
15 percent, and agriculture and natural resources for 11 percent. For details, see Table 7
in the Statistical Annex.

the top recipient with $850 million, followed by
the Philippines with $615 million, the PRC with
$561 million, and Sri Lanka with $324 million.

During 1970-1999, 520 ADB-assisted loan
projects and programs attracted cumulative
cofinancing of about $32.3 billion. This
cofinancing comprised $21.5 billion from official sources, $5.8 billion from commercial
sources, and $5.0 billion from export credit
sources. The energy sector accounted for
$14.5 billion (45 percent), transport and communications for $5.6 billion (17 percent),

agriculture and natural resources for $3.9 billion
(12 percent), social infrastructure for $3.0 billion
(9 percent), finance for $2.0 billion (6 percent), and
other sectors for $3.3 billion (11 percent).

Official cofinancing: Official cofinancing for
loan projects again crossed the $2.0 billion mark
in 1999 for the fourth time (including 1992,
1995, and 1996). Cofinancing in the form of
loans and grants from bilateral donors and
multilateral funding agencies amounted to
$2.1 billion in 1999, an increase of 117 percent from $996.0 million in 1998, and accounted for 71 percent of total cofinancing
mobilized in 1999. Twenty-four projects
received official development assistance funds
in 1999, compared with 16 in 1998. Bilateral
sources contributed $1.9 billion (90 percent) of
official sources, while multilateral sources contributed $217.5 million (10 percent). These figures reflect the significant amount of work
undertaken by ADB to pursue cofinancing from
Japan under the New Miyazawa Initiative (NMI),
which accounted for $1.2 billion in cofinancing
for four programs in 1999. In addition to funds
provided under the NMI, Japan provided
$545.0 million in cofinancing from its grant,
concessional, and semicommercial funds for
three projects. Bilateral cofinancing support was
also received from Australia, Denmark,
Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
Sweden, Thailand, United Kingdom, and United
States. The largest multilateral cofinanciers
were the European Investment Bank, Islamic
Development Bank, Nordic Development Fund,
OPEC Fund for International Development, and
World Bank.

ADB actively pursued technical assistance
grants from official sources, including annual
contributions to the Japan Special Fund (JSF)
and untied grants from other bilateral sources:
Australia, Denmark, Finland, France, Netherlands,
Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. Untied
grants from bilateral sources, where ADB
acted as the grant administrator, amounted
to $13.4 million.

 

3 Includes ADB-administered grants under loan projects.

With funding from the Government of
Japan, the JSF financed a total of $61 million
for 91 technical assistance projects on an untied
basis in 1999, accounting for 35 percent of the
funding for all technical assistance approved.
For details, see Japan Special Fund Technical
Assistance by Sector, 1999, on page 164.

New Channel Financing Agreements were
concluded with the governments of Finland,
Italy, New Zealand, and Norway, which committed grant funds in an amount equivalent to
$8.6 million.

With funding from the Government of
Japan, the Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility
(ACCSF) was established in 1999 to provide
assistance to member countries most affected
by the financial crisis. Eleven technical assistance projects for $10.5 million and interest payment assistance totaling $89.0 million for two
projects in Indonesia were approved. For details,
see Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility Technical Assistance by Sector, 1999, on page 165.

Commercial cofinancing: Commercial
cofinancing in 1999 amounted to $740.0 million, a decrease of about 59 percent from the
$1.8 billion achieved in 1998. The Asian financial
crisis negatively affected commercial
cofinancing activities because many lenders
withdrew from the region. The decrease in commercial cofinancing is also a function of the unusually large amount of commercial cofinancing
in 1998‘ and the slippage of several large
projects in the PRC and India in 1999.

Despite the relative lack of syndication
activities for project finance in Asia during the
year, ADB arranged commercial cofinancing for
several large infrastructure projects. This reconfirms ADB's catalytic role in mobilizing longterm funds for infrastructure in the region. For
example, syndication for the PRC's first BOT
water supply project (with a municipality as an
offtaker) was oversubscribed and hailed as a
model public-private partnership project (see
box on pages 46 and 47). Commercial cofinancing for projects in the Philippines was

relatively active, with syndication activities
being completed for the Maynilad Water
Services Inc. and the Ninoy Aquino International
Airport International Passenger Terminal III.
In addition to mobilizing commercial
cofinancing for projects, ADB focused its efforts
in 1999 on building public awareness of its
cofinancing and credit enhancement products.
A series of in-house workshops to train ADB
staff about cofinancing and guarantee operaions was held, and several cofinancing-related
consultations with DMC officials, both in the
context of country programming missions and
project-specific cofinancing missions, were concluded during the year.
Export credit cofinancing: Export credit
cofinancing amounted to $120 million and was
provided by a French export credit agency for
a water supply project in the Philippines.
Guarantees: The Review of the Bank's Guarantee Operations, which was approved by the
Board in October 1999, reconfirmed the imporance of ADB's partial risk guarantees (covering political risks) and partial credit guarantees
(covering both commercial and political risks)
in mobilizing private capital for ADB's projects.
To date, ADB has issued 10 partial credit guarantees in support of almost $1.1 billion in commercial cofinancing under syndicated loans and
capital market instruments.

During 1999, ADB continued to expand its
guarantee operations to support long-term
commercial cofinancing for its projects. This
included further processing of a partial credit
guarantee for a public sector power project in
India ($125.0 million) and another in the
Philippines ($350.0 million). For the project in
the Philippines, a guarantee under the ACCSF is
being considered. In addition, ADB continued
work on a partial risk guarantee for a private sector
power project in Bangladesh ($70.0 million).

Portfolio management

Project quality and portfolio performance: To
realize ADB's goal of poverty reduction, ADB
took various initiatives to assist its DMCs in fostering more effective economic management
and efficient use of scarce resources. It is also
recognized that an increasing portion of ADB's
financial assistance should be directed to those
DMCs that use funds effectively. To strengthen
the linkage between country performance and
the allocation of scarce resources, therefore,
ADB is moving toward performance-based
allocation of resources, whereby the quality of
portfolio performance will be placed at the forefront of its dialogue with its DMCs in planning
future operations, and in assessing internal
efficiency and external effectiveness.

ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

ADB's guidelines for procurement and
guidelines on the use of consultants were revised in 1998 to include provisions on anticorruption and posted on ADB's web site in early
1999. The use of ADB's sample bidding documents was made mandatory for procuring
goods and civil works through international
competitive bidding.

To improve the efficiency of its information systems, ADB launched in November 1999
the Financial Management and Human
Resource Management Information System
(FM/HRMIS) Project to integrate ADB computer
systems for more efficient management of
internal operations. The Project is expected to
be implemented within three years. At the same
time, ADB's internal systems, programs, and
facilities were reviewed and tested for year 2000
(Y2K) compliance. ADB assistance in this area
to its DMCs comprised increasing awareness
of potential problems and minimizing the extent
and nature of potential failures resulting from
Y2K noncompliance in ADB-financed projects
and in critical sectors. As of 31 December 1999,
ADB had approved 14 requests for Y2K consulting services, remediation work, and contingency
planning from nine DMCs.

Project administration: Sixty-six new loans
were approved in 1999: 62 were public sector
and 4 were private sector loans. This brought
the number of loans under administration to
527 as of the end of 1999, comprising 479 loans
in the public sector and 48 loans in the private
sector. Of the public sector projects, implementation progress was satisfactory for 385 loans,
including 38 loans rated highly satisfactory.

These projects conformed to satisfactory
progress in financial, physical, and project
aspects of implementation. Ninety-three loans
were rated less than satisfactory and one was
inactive; all were encountering implementation
or operational problems. In terms of achieving development objectives, 437 loans were
rated satisfactory (including 20 loans rated
as highly satisfactory) while 41 loans were
less than satisfactory and 1 was inactive.
These ratings resulted from an assessment
of the development outcomes, impacts, or
benefits expected from various project components and outputs.

Altogether, 817 project administration
reviews, including private sector loan and
multiproject reviews, were fielded to assess the
progress of projects and to discuss problems,
if any, with executing agencies. A total of
8,591 person-days were spent on these project
reviews, which translates into an average of
13 person-days per project.

ADB's regional and resident missions (RMs)
continued to play an important role in project
implementation. To date, administration of a
total of 164 loans for 155 projects has been delegated to five RMs—Bangladesh, India,
Indonesia, Nepal, and Pakistan—and the South
Pacific Regional Mission. More responsibility
will be delegated to them, commensurate with
their project implementation and administration capacity.

Country portfolio review missions (CPRMs)
were undertaken in 17 DMCs to discuss implementation problems, timely submission of audited project accounts and audited financial

introduced the Loan Financial Information Web
Services (http://Ifis.adb.org) to meet these
needs. The web site provides detailed loan portfolio data and selected reports with facilities
for downloading. Estimated debt service payments and disbursement manuals directly related to loan operations are also available to
the specified users. The web services provide
improved efficiency and lower administrative costs
to both ADB and its borrowers in meeting their
information-seeking and reporting needs.Operational Priorities

 

statements, cross-sectoral issues, and remedial measures with senior government officials. The special portfolio restructuring for
Indonesia and the Philippines was undertaken
in which $800 million for cancellation was
identified during the review missions.

Eighty-nine projects were completed during the year, bringing the cumulative number
of completed projects to 1,295. Project completion reports were circulated for 61 projects,
bringing the total number of reports prepared
as of the end of 1999 to 877. For details, see
Table 12 in the Statistical Annex.

As in earlier years, project administration
procedures continued to be revised in light of
ADB's strategic plan. In 1999, following ADBwide implementation of the project/program
performance report (PPR) introduced in 1998,
the system was enhanced and made compatible with new project rating criteria that are
more stringent and consistent. The system was
modified to record and monitor additional information on the level of compliance with loan
covenants, particularly the submission of
project accounts and financial statements (with
actual delays in submission), and environmental and social concerns, as well as Y2K compliance indicators of the project. Some project
quality performance indicators and details of
project ratings were also added to the PPR.

ADB also undertook a number of other
initiatives and activities during the year to
improve project quality and expedite project
implementation. Preparatory activities included
increasing beneficiary participation and stakeholder involvement, approving advance actions
on procurement and recruitment of consultants,
encouraging early establishment of project offices,
and hiring qualified personnel. Various advisory
technical assistance activities in selected DMCs
were implemented to assist governments in improving project implementation, project financial
management, and procurement.

Contract awards: Contracts totaling
$4.6 billion (excluding contracts for technical
assistance projects) were awarded in 1999 by
executing agencies in DMCs for consulting
services and procurement of goods, related
services, and civil works. This represented a
20 percent decrease from 1998. Consultancy

contracts under loan projects totaled $143.7 million and involved 176 consulting contracts (77 international and 99 domestic). For details, see
Tables 13-20 in the Statistical Annex.

Loan disbursements: The 1999 loan disbursements, $4.8 billion, fell short of the year's
target of $5.9 billion by 18.0 percent and the
1998 figures by 28.7 percent. OCR disbursements amounted to $3.7 billion and ADF disbursements to $1.1 billion, representing
76.9 percent and 23.1 percent of the total
amount, respectively. Disbursements are lower
than projections in 1999 because of slower
project implementation than projected and delays in fulfilling program conditionalities. Lower
disbursements in 1999 compared with 1998 are
attributable to relatively high disbursements in
1998 for emergency program loans in response
to the Asian financial crisis. The comparative
details of disbursements in 1998 and 1999 by
lending modality are shown in Table 14 in the
Statistical Annex.

Project implementation and administration
seminars: Nine seminars were held on project
implementation and administration in 1999.
These included seven in-country seminars (conducted in Cambodia, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao PDR,
Mongolia, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam);
one regional seminar held at ADB headquarters; and one training-of-trainers seminar in the
PRC. A total of 316 DMC representatives
participated in the two-week sessions. The56

ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

in-country seminars trained an average of 35 individuals per country. To proactively strengthen
procurement capability in executing agencies
unfamiliar with ADB practices, five special procurement workshops were conducted during
project inception missions. Seminars were held
in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz
Republic, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan, and
Viet Nam on the use of consultants.

The seminars train project directors, managers, and key executing agency staff on modern principles and techniques for managing
project implementation. This includes familiarization with ADB guidelines, practices, and
policies pertaining to procurement, recruitment of consultants, disbursements, anticorruption, and associated matters. Moreover,
the seminars are part of a systematic and
long-term approach to improve project implementation in DMCs. The approach includes
capacity-building activities focused on
strengthening institutions and developing human resources, and indirectly addresses governance issues such as accountability,
transparency, and anticorruption.

Formal evaluation and informal feedback
from past seminars indicate that training has
succeeded in strengthening professional skills
and raising the level of understanding of ADB's
project implementation and administration requirements. The seminar structure and content
are under continuous review to better meet new
demands facing ADB-financed projects, and the
changing environment in which they are implemented. Future seminars will reflect ADB's focus
on poverty reduction and the trend to increase
the involvement of local governments and
community organizations in projects.

Business opportunities seminars: Sixteen
seminars on business opportunities were held
in PRC; India; Italy; Japan; Republic of Korea;
Malaysia; Singapore; Taipei,China; Thailand;
Turkey; and United States. The seminars were
directed at consultants and business leaders
interested in pursuing consulting contracts and
projects financed by ADB. Participants were
provided with an overview of business opportunities under ADB-financed loans and technical assistance. They were instructed on how to
prepare bids and proposals that comply with

ADB guidelines, and were informed of ADB's
procedures for evaluating bids and ranking
consulting proposals. The seminars proved to
be an excellent forum for disseminating ADB's
policy on anticorruption.

The seminars generated a high level of
interest, with an average attendance of 70 persons per seminar. Overall, more than 1,100 consultants, suppliers, contractors, and business
leaders participated in the presentations, discussions, and one-on-one consultations. In
addition, three mini-seminars were organized
at ADB headquarters for visiting missions from
Australia, Canada, and United States. The feedback from participants has been positive. Companies previously unfamiliar with ADB reported
that they would pursue future business opportunities. On the other hand, firms with a history of working on ADB-financed projects
routinely send new employees, verifying the
value they see in appreciating ADB's practices.

ADB also held three seminars on developing domestic consultants in Nepal, Pakistan, and
Philippines.

Private sector investment portfolio

ADB's private sector portfolio at the end of 1999
totaled $1.1 billion, up by 8.5 percent from $1.0 billion in 1998. The increase of $89.0 million was
the net result of new approvals, disbursements,
repayments, disposals, cancellations, prepayments, write-offs, and currency translation adjustments. Of the total portfolio, 63 percent was in
loans amounting to $709.2 million and $423.3 million in equity investments.

The 1999 total portfolio comprised
$691.7 million in disbursed investments and
$440.7 million in undisbursed commitments.
The disbursed investments increased by
$37.0 million or 5.7 percent over the 1998 total
portfolio of $654.7 million. Cumulative disbursements increased from $1.2 billion at the end of
1998 to $1.3 billion at the end of 1999, an
increase of $90.3 million.

Forty percent of the total portfolio was
accounted for by loans and equity investments
in infrastructure projects, to which ADB is giving priority in support of the DMCs' efforts to
attract private investment in the infrastructureOperational Priorities

 

sector (see table at right). Another 26 percent of
the portfolio comprised equity investments in pioneering institutions that help promote finance
sector development in DMCs and loans to established private finance companies and banks for
onlending to small and medium enterprises.

The portfolio also included 16 percent
equity stakes in investment funds and their
corresponding fund management companies.
These funds comprised venture capital funds,
mutual funds, private equity funds, and larger
funds that provide equity and/or debt financing to infrastructure projects. Investments in
funds enable ADB to leverage its own available
resources to support private investment. The
balance of the portfolio (18 percent) comprised
loans and equity investments in manufacturing, agriculture, and other industries. ADB support for these sectors started in the mid-1980s
when several DMC governments began to encourage the private sector to undertake large
industrial ventures, particularly with foreign
technology and investment.

At the end of 1999, the total portfolio
included loans and equity investments in
91 companies, comprising 75 country-specific
companies in 13 DMCs and 16 regional financial entities and funds. The net reduction in the
number of companies in the portfolio from
100 in 1998 was the net result of the addition
of four new companies, cancellation of two
investments, full disposal of eight investments,
liquidation of two investments, and a merger
of two companies. Of the 91 companies comprising the portfolio, 54 were operating
profitably, 8 were in various stages of implementation, and 29 were underperforming. Some
of the underperformers affected by the financial
crisis have since recovered. The other
underperforming investments are being closely
supervised and several of them are the subject
of intensive workout efforts. In many cases, this
involves a change of management, financial and
business restructuring, and recovery efforts,
including legal action to enforce ADB's remedies
as a creditor and other legal rights. In fact, the
pursuit of such legal remedies can serve to
complement ADB's public sector assistance to
DMCs in introducing appropriate bankruptcy
laws to improve their solvency regimes.

Performance evaluation
and development impact

ADB's increasing concern about the impact of
its assistance on poverty reduction has added
a new dimension to evaluation. While learning
through evaluation remains the key function of
the Operations Evaluation Office (OEO), the
evaluation and the learning activities have a
clearer focus on and revolve around ADB's main
purpose of reducing poverty (see figure on page
58). Because of the broader significance of the
impact of poverty reduction interventions, ADB
is aware that its evaluation procedures must be
strengthened through more rigorous evaluation
standards and practices. Evaluation must58

ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

produce results that are operationally useful for
OEO's feedback function and position as a
source of learning. OEO is, therefore, paying
increased attention to project objectives and
designs that can be evaluated. This will facilitate monitoring and verification of ADB's strategic intent of contributing to poverty reduction.

Progress was significant in 1999 with the
introduction of the project performance management system. This emphasizes identification
of monitorable project performance indicators
and reporting on project progress and development impact, including poverty, through the
project performance report. Use of the logical
framework is mandatory.

OEO specifically supported ADB's main purpose in 1999 with a special study on the effectiveness of ADB approaches and assistance to
poverty reduction in five countries (see box on

page 59). OEO further examined crosscutting
issues through three other special evaluation
studies covering governance (public expenditure
management), NGOs and CBOs, and the social
and environmental impacts of hydropower
projects. Other highlights of the year's work were
a country assistance program evaluation (CAPE)
for Viet Nam and a special evaluation study on
ADB's lending operations in Thailand during the
Asian financial crisis. OEO also provided support
for preparing documentation for the February
2000 discussions on the ADF replenishment.
OEO completed 41 major reports in 1999,
comprising 21 project/program performance
audit reports (PPARs), 4 technical assistance performance audit reports (TPARs), 2 reevaluation
studies, 3 impact evaluation studies, 6 special
evaluation studies, 1 CAPE, Twenty-First Annual

Project/Program and Technical Assistance
Performance Audit Reports

The 21 PPARs in 1999 covered 24 projects/
programs, reflecting OEO's thrust to look at
units larger than single projects or programs.
Of the 24 projects/programs, 4 were in Group
Acountries, 5 in Group B1 countries, 7 in Group
B2 countries, and 8 in Group C countries (see
box on page 60). Eight were in agriculture and
natural resources, 10 in physical infrastructure,
4in social infrastructure, and 2 in finance.

Cumulatively, by the end of 1999, 42 PPARs
had been prepared for 566 projects/programs
in 26 DMCs. Of these, 57 percent were classified as generally successful, 32 percent partly
successful, and 11 percent unsuccessful; two
projects were not rated.

Of the 24 projects/programs examined in
1999, 14 (58 percent) were rated as generally
successful, 8 (34 percent) partly successful, and
2 (8 percent) unsuccessful. The five projects and
three programs in agriculture and natural
resources were all rated generally (4) or partly
(4) successful. Nine of the 10 physical infrastructure projects were generally successful, the
other—a private sector loan for energy—was

he special evaluation study on the effective
ness of ADB approaches and assistance to poverty reduction covered four projects each in five
countries—Bangladesh, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao
People's Democratic Republic, Nepal, and
Philippines. The review highlighted the need to
develop a comprehensive strategy and portfolio

for each country that ensures consistent and
broad integration of poverty reduction issues into
the country operational strategy and project
design. The study showed that, where project
components are not specifically targeted at a
group of people or at an activity that will

projects were partly successful while two were
unsuccessful. In the finance sector, one program was generally successful and one project
was partly successful. Because of the small
sample size, an annual comparison of performance by sector was not made.

The 4 TPARs covered 16 technical assistance grants. Nine were rated generally successful, three partly successful, and three—all in the
same sector in the same country—unsuccessful; one was not rated.

Reevaluation Studies

Reevaluation of the Third Tea Development
Project in Sri Lanka reconfirmed the PPAR's conclusion that the Project was partly successful.
While economic returns remained below appraisal
estimates, privatization of estate management and
assets starting in 1992 brought about significant
changes and reversed declines in yield. Smallholders benefited from extension campaigns and
fertilizer credits. The review demonstrated an interesting case of an ADB-financed project that
went through two policy environments: public
sector management of nationalized estates and
privatization. An important lesson learned is the
need to obtain a proper policy environment before funding is approved.

The reevaluation of the Fuel Conversion
Project in the PRC reclassified the project from
generally successful to unsuccessful, as longterm viability had been severely impaired by

particularly impact on a target group, benefits
are usually unevenly distributed and generally
favor the nonpoor.

More care needs to be taken in defining
indicators and in designing data collection and
processing methods to facilitate the evaluation
of benefits to the poor. Country-specific poverty
reduction strategies need to guide policy dialogue
to determine priorities and the sequencing of
interventions. Participatory approaches, adopted
in some projects targeting the poor, have helped
achieve project objectives and impact, such as in
microcredit and community-based projects.60

largely exogenous factors. While the Project was
efficiently implemented and the converted units
were being adequately maintained and operated
at design efficiency, the key objective of generating an economic advantage from fuel substitution was not fully met; and there were
negative project-related environmental impacts
from using coal. The reevaluation concluded
that project sustainability depends on the competitiveness of a power plant's cost structure,
economic outlook within areas served by the
plant, and direction of environmental policies
relative to power generation.

Impact Evaluation Studies

The study on ADB assistance to the water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector in Indonesia
assessed six completed WSS projects and eight
completed urban development projects with
WSS components. The projects generally fell
short of achieving some of their targets and
objectives, although they delivered real benefits
to consumers through lower-cost water being
made available in greater quantities than before.
The completed WSS projects only partly succeeded in targeting low-income communities.

Operation and maintenance resources for
project facilities were inadequate and resulted
in high unaccounted-for water and reduced cost
recovery. The WSS projects evidenced weak
implementation capacity of the executing and
implementing agencies and the lack of political will to implement policy reforms.

The urban development projects, on the other
hand, were generally successful in achieving their
objectives based on actual physical accomplishments and project benefits, and on the pioneering role in these projects of the integrated urban
development approach. The common shortcomings of urban development projects included counterpart funding problems, poor institutional
arrangements, and lack of experience of the implementing agencies with integrated projects.

The study findings highlighted key WSS
issues: (i) the urgent need for tariff structure
and other reforms; (ii) the need for local
community/beneficiary participation in project
planning, design, and implementation; (iii) the
high level of unaccounted-for water contributing to poor financial returns; (iv) the weaknesses
in institutional capacity and interagency coordination; and (v) the need for sanitation to be
given more priority.

revised classification system for ADB's developing member countries (DMCs) was approved by the

Board of Directors in December 1998, and took effect on 1 January 1999. Under the revised system,
two criteria—per capita gross national product and debt repayment capacity—were used to determine the
classification of borrowing DMCs into Groups A, B1, B2, and C.' This classification system determines the
(i) degree of eligibility to borrow from the Asian Development Fund (ADF), (ii) applicable ceiling on ADB
financing, and (iii) minimum share of government contribution to technical assistance costs.

Group A includes Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cambodia, Kiribati, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao People's Democratic
Republic, Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tajikistan, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

Group B1 includes Bangladesh, Cook Islands,? Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tonga, and Viet Nam.

The impact evaluation study on the Greater
Mekong Subregion (GMS) program aimed to
assess the relevance, sustainability, and
efficiency of ADB development assistance to the
GMS program. The program has provided member countries with the opportunity to create a
shared vision of the subregion's future development. Progress has been made in promoting
dialogue and reaching agreements on steps to
facilitate increased economic cooperation.
Agreement has been reached on identifying and
monitoring regional projects, and on securing
financing for several major projects. The GMS
program has encouraged dialogue among member countries, notably at the ministerial level,
and contributed to better understanding among
members, and a willingness to work together
for mutual benefit. On a more general level, the
findings of the study support ADB involvement
in regional cooperation under a framework
where it (i) targets the ADF donors’ objectives
concerning contributions to regional peace and
stability, prosperity, and sustainable resource
management; and (ii) provides economies of
scale, reduces transaction costs, speeds up
development through improved sharing of
knowledge, and increases opportunities—
particularly those that partners, on their own,
cannot capture (such as improved resource
mobilization, private sector development, and
gains from trade). The study, while supporting the GMS initiative, finds that the program
has been constrained by limitations in ADB
operations. Changes may be warranted in the
process of allocating regional technical
assistance resources and in programming
loan proposals, and reconsideration may need
to be given to establishing a regional cooperation facility.

The impact evaluation study on ADB
assistance for technical education and vocational training (TEVT) assessed the long-term
impact of 10 projects in four countries—
Malaysia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, and Sri
Lanka. The study confirmed the conclusions of
the PPARs that the projects in Malaysia were
generally successful, but those in the other
countries did not sustain their impact for more
than a few years after project completion. TEVT
schools in Malaysia continue to be well provided

for in terms of facilities, equipment, teachers,
consumables, and other support materials,
compared with the country's academic schools.
On the other hand, with no major reinvestment
after project completion, the capacities of
project inputs in Pakistan, Papua New Guinea,
and Sri Lanka have gradually dissipated over
the years. The study revealed the need to forge
strong partnerships between TEVT institutions
and industry, bearing in mind that (i) education authorities and heads of TEVT institutions
shift from a predominantly “safety net” orientation to a more "source-of-competitive advantage" orientation, without necessarily discarding
the former; (ii) governments, particularly those
of Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, and Sri Lanka,
need to raise their level of commitment to TEVT;
and (iii) countries, with help from funding agencies, need to support TEVT over the long term,
given its long development cycle.

Special Evaluation Studies

In addition to the poverty study, five other
special evaluation studies were done in 1999.
Two examined the use of technical assistance
to assist public expenditure management,
capacity building, and institutional strengthening. The study on ADB assistance for the
reform of public expenditure management in
Bhutan, India, Kiribati, and Lao PDR examined 11 technical assistance grants; the study

International Monetary Fund (IMF)-led “rapid

example of coordination among funding
agencies. The policy measures were closely
coordinated, complementary, and mutually
reinforcing. The Social Sector Program loan was
ADB's own initiative, implemented in consultation with IMF and the World Bank; the Program
aimed to cushion the adverse impact of the
financial crisis on the most vulnerable sector
of society. The Export Financing Facility was
also ADB's initiative, in careful consultation with
Thailand's Ministry of Finance; the Facility was
designed to restore the confidence of the
international markets in Thailand's finance
sector. Highlights of the lessons learned are
provided (see box on page 63).

The special evaluation study on the social
and environmental impacts of four ADBfinanced hydropower projects in PRC,
Indonesia, Lao PDR, and Malaysia provides recommendations for improving the design and
processing of future hydropower projects to
minimize their adverse impacts. The selected
study projects did not result in disastrous
environmental and social impacts; but shortcomings were noted, most of which could have
been avoided or compensated for through more
diligence on the part of project proponents. The
review reveals that the identification and mitigation of project impacts improved with time
as ADB began to make sizable advances in
articulating and clarifying its policies on
environmental and social issues.

The study's recommendations include the
need for (i) environmental and social scientists
to be an integral part of the design team for a
sensitive project; (ii) project preparation to
include adequate baseline data on environmental
and social aspects, along with a description of
methodologies for monitoring project impacts;
(iii) specific assurances in the loan agreement and
verifiable targets to ensure the implementation
of important measures such as income restoration programs; (iv) DMC agencies and ADB to
screen rigorously the capacity of construction
firms bidding on hydropower projects and to
ensure that prequalification requirements,
penalties, and performance bonds are explicitly
indicated in their contracts; (v) improvedOperational Priorities

63

 

progress reports to ADB by ensuring that project
units supervising mitigation measures have the
necessary management and technical skills to
collect appropriate data, and that the enforcement agency has the capacity to review them;
and (vi) increases in ADB internal resources to
provide for multiskill supervision teams to
evaluate the progress of mitigation measures
in Category A projects.

The special study on NGOs and CBOs
covered 54 projects in nine countries—
Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Nepal,
Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Sri
Lanka, and Viet Nam—and assessed the effectiveness and appropriateness of NGO/CBO involvement in ADB lending and technical assistance
operations. The study shows that NGO involvement in ADB projects has increased significantly,
with nearly half of all projects now including some
such involvement. While performance has varied
on project-to-project and country-to-country
bases, there is strong evidence that NGO/CBO
involvement enhances consultative and participatory project development, and improves the
effectiveness of projects. This applies not only
to social sector, rural/community development,
and microcredit projects—where NGOs/CBOs
have been most visible—but also to technical
assistance projects requiring early beneficiary
consultation, stakeholder analysis, and consideration of resettlement concerns.

In common with other funding agency
assessments, however, the study notes that
partnerships with NGOs/CBOs are not a panacea

he study focused on the specific performance

aspects of individual projects/programs in collaboration with the Office of the Auditor General
of Thailand. High volatility in financial variables is
one of the key risks in project lending through
financial intermediaries, as in the cases of the Rural
Enterprise Credit Project and the Export Financing

Facility. When a banking crisis is involved, a credit
crunch and excess liquidity in a banking system
are potential impediments to using a loan. When
the abandonment of a currency peg is involved,
the risk profile changes due to currency

for improving project effectiveness. Such involvement should be on a selective basis, taking into account NGO/CBO skills and capacity
for involvement in the project and location in
question, and the specific country/policy
environment. Selecting, managing, and monitoring of NGO/CBO involvement must be
improved; and the respective roles of NGOs/
CBOs and executing agencies must be clearly
defined. ADB's capacity for NGO/CBO cooperation should be strengthened, together with
improved reporting and information systems.

Country Assistance Program Evaluation

OEO reviewed ADB's development assistance to
Viet Nam during 1993-1998. The study was the
second CAPE, which aims to assess the relevance,
efficacy, and effectiveness of ADB lending and
technical assistance operations. The review
revealed that ADB's country strategy has been
appropriate and consistent with Viet Nam's needs
and conditions. The country program has broadly
followed the strategy, although it was more
diffused in focus during 1996-1998, and has
supported evolving government priorities. From
the resumption of ADB lending operations in
1993-1995, the country program, reflecting the
findings of economic and sector work undertaken
from 1989, emphasized infrastructure rehabilitation and improvement, mostly in agriculture, social
infrastructure, and transport and communications.
The broadening of the 1996-1998 programs
indicates efforts to correlate ADB assistance

Experience with the Export Financing Facility
highlights the need for a review of business processes in handling a large syndication deal to
ensure swift consensus building, both internally
and among lenders. Policy-based lending can be
effective not only in the finance and other economic sectors but also in the social sector. In
supporting social safety nets through a program
loan, a government's close attention to the effective and efficient use of counterpart funds is
critical. There is a need for an enhanced monitoring framework with clearly defined performance indicators.64

ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

increasingly with crosscutting issues—not only
those of ADB but also those of Viet Nam. The ADB
strategy and the country program have been
relatively effective in supporting policy reforms
through lending operations, although increased
efficiency is desirable.

The major recommendations of the evaluation are to (i) strengthen supervision through
greater coordination among provincial-level government officials, more staff time for project processing and implementation, increased staff
strength of the Viet Nam Resident Mission, and
a sharper geographical focus for ADB operations
to narrow staff time requirements; (ii) provide a
framework in the country operational strategy
(COS) that will define priority areas and sequencing of capacity building to be followed by the
country assistance plan (CAP); and (iii) identify performance indicators in both the COS and CAP
documents to serve as the basis for monitoring
and evaluating ADB's program of assistance.

Annual Performance Evaluation Program

The 1999 annual performance evaluation
program (APEP) assessed the quality and effectiveness of ADB's self-evaluation processes concerning project and technical assistance activities,
principally project/program completion reports
(PCRs), technical assistance completion reports
(TCRs), and country portfolio reviews (CPRs). PCRs
and TCRs tend to base assessment upon achieving outputs as opposed to achieving objectives.
Much of the basis for rating TCRs is the opinion of the rater or the executing agency. CPRs,
on the other hand, focus on implementation
issues and do not assess progress toward development objectives. PCRs, TCRs, and CPRs need
more analysis and critical assessment of inputs.
Other OEO studies support these findings. PCR
ratings are often higher than PPAR ratings, partly
because of the PCR's focus on outputs as opposed
to the PPAR's focus on impacts.

PCR and TCR preparation is constrained by
their being done too soon after implementation, but more rigorous attention would help.
Strengthened guidelines and greater resources
are needed to prepare for PCR missions and to
write the reports. For these reasons, OEO is
formally reviewing selected PCRs.

 

The terms of reference for CPR studies need
strengthening. Changes in CPR missions will
have resource implications.

Strengthening the performance evaluation
capability of DMCs

In 1999, OEO processed two advisory technical assistance grants for building evaluation
capability. The technical assistance for strengthening results in monitoring and evaluation in
the Philippines aims at helping develop and
institutionalize processes and procedures for
results-oriented monitoring and evaluation
(RME), which refocuses monitoring on assessing impacts and reorients evaluation from
postevaluation to concurrent evaluation during project implementation. The technical
assistance for evaluation capacity building in
the PRC is for continuing to build performance
management capacity in the PRC's administration. It focuses on the Central Government by
promoting a culture of evaluation within the
newly created Key Project Inspectorate Office
in the State Development Planning Commission.

Six TCRs were prepared in 1999, three of
which were noteworthy for helping develop and/
or strengthen performance evaluation capacity
in DMCs. The technical assistance for strengthening evaluation capacity in the PRC was
successful in developing a blueprint and strategies for bolstering evaluation as a governance
function in the country. Associated training generated advocacy for and greater understanding
of performance evaluation concepts. The technical assistance for pilot testing a project performance management system in the Philippines was
deemed partly successful. It had developed knowledge of and skills in RME techniques and promoted awareness in the Government of the merits
of RME, thereby facilitating formal introduction
and acceptance of RME. The technical assistance

Developing Asia and the Pacific

sia's recovery in 1999 was stronger

and quicker than most observers had

expected. Gross domestic product

(GDP) grew at about 6.1 percent in
1999, compared with 2.3 percent in 1998. The
recovery, reflecting the region's inherent
strengths, was based on a timely and strong
policy action and a favorable external environment, which permitted a rapid expansion in the
region's manufactured exports. While the recovery in some crisis-affected economies was even
stronger, it has been broad-based with all the
subregions showing improved growth performance in 1999. The newly industrialized economies (NIEs) recorded a growth of 7.0 percent;
South Asia achieved a reasonable GDP growth
of 5.4 percent despite poor performance in the
agriculture sector; and the Central Asian
republics (CARs) shrugged off the adverse
impacts of the Russian crisis, with their GDP
increasing at 2.9 percent in 1999, compared with
only 0.8 percent in 1998. Southeast Asia and

the Pacific economies moved out of the recession, recording GDP growth rates of 3.3 and
4.4 percent, respectively.

Despite the recovery, the region continues
to bear the adverse social impacts of the crisis.
In many of the crisis-affected countries, unemployment remains well above precrisis levels
and the corporate subsector has still not
returned to its past output levels. The number
of people living below the poverty line went up
significantly during the crisis and has not yet
started to go down. In Indonesia, for example,
the number of people below the poverty line
increased to about 36 million in 1999. It is
important to put in place policies that will
directly address the issue of improving overall
social welfare—especially poverty reduction.
Several factors will determine if this recovery
will be sustained in the coming years and
reverse the welfare losses that were suffered
during 1997-1998; the most important is the
continuation of structural reforms, particularly
in the finance and corporate sectors, which were
at the core of the crisis. These reforms are far

from complete, and political will is needed to
push them to their successful conclusion. The
high level of nonperforming loans in the region's
banking subsector continues to dampen credit
availability to the corporate subsector. The level
of nonperforming loans has to be brought down
with decisive policy action if the recovery is to
take hold and investor confidence restored. A
real danger exists: recovery can induce some
complacency in establishing the required social
safety nets. This complacency has to be avoided
if the adverse social consequences of any future
crisis in the region are to be minimized.

The continuation of a favorable external
demand environment for the region's manufactured exports will be a major factor in sustaining the recovery. Preliminary indications are
positive with the United States (US) economy
progressing strongly and signs of European and
Japanese economies improving. Oil prices may,
however, dampen these prospects.

Stronger interest rates in industrial economies may slow the flow of portfolio capital to
the region. However, recent data indicate that
net private capital inflows to Asia rebounded
to about $40 billion in 1999 from $6 billion in
1998. Net private outflows from the five crisisaffected economies declined substantially from
$36.4 billion in 1998 to $3.7 billion in 1999. Net
private capital flows to the Republic of Korea,
assisted by lower bank repayment, strengthened
to about $8 billion in 1999 after recording an
outflow of nearly $25 billion in 1998. However,
with many claims due in 2000, net private capital
flows may slow. In the People’s Republic of
China (PRC), net private capital flows remained
at $34 billion in 1999, the same level as in 1998.
For India, the "feel good" factor—after the
positive election results and the expected
opening up of the insurance subsector and
other reforms—is likely to increase foreign
capital inflows.

Eight of the 12 Pacific economies recorded
higher growth rates in 1999 than in 1998. Fiscal
and monetary policies were generally consistent with maintaining macroeconomic balances,
except in Papua New Guinea. Economic prospects for the subregion in the short to medium
term will depend on the success of public sector reforms, sustained macroeconomic
stabilization, and private sector development.
The region remains vulnerable to external
shocks, both economic and climatic. More effort
is needed to preserve fragile environments and
improve water supply.

The global economy

Supported by the stronger-than-expected Asian
recovery, the world GDP growth rebounded to
3.0 percent in 1999 from 2.5 percent in 1998.
GDP growth in the advanced economies roseRegional and Country Highlights

to 2.8 percent in 1999 from 2.2 percent in 1998.
Canada and the US continued to perform
strongly in 1999, supported by buoyant
domestic demand generated by rising asset
prices. Growth momentum in the euro area,
although slightly weakened, has been
sustained with GDP growth of 2.1 percent in
1999, compared with 2.8 percent in the
previous year. In Japan, strong and repeated
fiscal stimuli and an expansionary monetary
policy, combined with the rebound in emerging market economies, underpinned economic
recovery in 1999. The NIEs of Asia staged a
remarkable turnaround, registering a growth of
7.0 percent from a decline of 2.1 percent in 1998.
Growth in the developing regions of the world
improved in 1999, expanding by 5.3 percent
from 3.7 percent in 1998. Economic performance of the developing economies of Africa
and the Middle East has been affected by
movements in commodity prices, increased
pressures for structural reforms, and improvements in trade and political cooperation. GDP
growth in Africa in 1999 was slightly lower at
3.1 percent from 3.4 percent in the previous
year. In the Middle East, GDP growth was
nearly halved to 1.8 percent in 1999 from
3.2 percent in 1998. In Latin America, growth
in 1999 was almost nil as most countries in
the region, with the exception of Brazil,
experienced recessionary conditions during
the year.

Concerted policy response by the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) member countries and
strong reflationary policies in the crisisaffected Asian economies in the last quarter
of 1998 assisted the recovery. The coordinated response—comprising synchronized
interest rate cuts and fiscal stimuli taken in
response to the Russian and Brazilian crises,
which threatened to worsen the impact of the
Asian crisis on the global economy—laid the
basis for the rebound in the global economy in
1999 (see chart on page 65). Stability was
restored in the Asian currency and financial
markets. The euro withstood the Russian crisis
and the Brazilian contagion was effectively
contained. As financial conditions improved,
market confidence returned in most emerging

market economies affected by the crises, allowing monetary conditions to ease and providing
the stimulus for economic recovery.

The decision of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut back oil
production in April 1999 resulted in increased
oil prices to an average of $17.46 per barrel in
1999 from $9.81 per barrel at the end of 1998,
rising to a peak of $24.62 per barrel at the
end of 1999. This development arrested the
decline in the prices of non-oil commodities,
providing relief to commodity-exporting
countries. Accelerating growth in the US,
recovery in Europe, and strong rebounds in
industrial activities in Japan and the NIEs of
Asia have combined to raise the global
demand for industrial commodities. Foodstuff
prices weakened because of surpluses and
mounting inventories.

World trade accelerated from about
4 percent in 1998 to 5 percent in 1999. This is
significantly below a record high of nearly
11 percent in 1997, reflecting lower trade
growth in transition economies and Latin
America. The US economy continued to
provide strong demand stimulus to global
economic growth with imports increasing by
8 percent. Asian economies staged a sharp
recovery in exports and imports, compared
with the downturn in 1998. Exports in developing Asia increased by 4.6 percent, compared
with a contraction of 5.6 percent in 1998.
Imports also went up by 6.8 percent in 1999,
compared with a contraction of 17.1 percent
in 1998.

In 1999, world inflation at about 5 percent
declined to its lowest level in 40 years, reflecting
the intensified consensus among authorities to
target inflation as one of the main policy
objectives. As the global economic recovery
gained momentum and oil prices stabilized
in 1999, pressure on other commodity and
factor prices began to increase. Inflation
started to rise in many countries, although it
remained low in the OECD countries. While
inflation was subdued in product markets,
asset prices displayed considerable volatility,
contributing to a degree of macroeconomic
instability in some emerging market economies during the year.ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

Newly industrialized economies

The NIEs started to recover in 1999, with GDP
growth up by 7.0 percent. This represented a
strong recovery from the recessionary conditions of 1998 when these economies contracted
by 2.1 percent. The higher growth was achieved
with a further moderation in inflation as the
subregion continued to show excess capacity
that exerted downward pressures on prices. This
is also reflected in the continued weakness of
domestic investment demand in most of these
economies, except for the Republic of Korea
where gross fixed investment rose significantly
in 1999. Domestic consumption demand, however, showed a modest increase as consumer
confidence returned and incomes improved.
Overall employment conditions remained weak
as capacity rationalization and use of more
capital- and technology-intensive methods kept
labor demand at a low level. Use of domestic
reflationary policies which, together with higher
electronics export demand, was primarily
responsible for initiating the recovery, will be
limited in the coming years as fiscal deficits
become unsustainable. Exports, which had
declined in 1998 as a result of the crisis, staged
a modest recovery in 1999 with an average
growth of 5.1 percent. Import demand increased
more rapidly as growth returned and rising
exports pushed up the demand for imported
components. However, it will be some time

before NIEs regain their former export dynamism. A large-scale restructuring of capacities and policy measures will need to be
undertaken to restore the international competitiveness of these economies.

Hong Kong, China

Economic performance

Economic growth: After contracting by
5.1 percent in 1998, Hong Kong, China's
economy recorded a positive growth of 2.9 percent in 1999. This was mainly supported by
improved private consumption, accelerated
growth in government spending, and a rise in
exports of goods and services. However, high
real interest rates and an uncertain business
outlook continued to weaken domestic investment, which fell more sharply than in 1998.

Recovery started in the second quarter of
1999, with falling nominal interest rates,
improved sentiment in the local stock and property markets, and a rising number of tourists.
Consumer demand improved, but the total value
of retail sales still fell by 8.1 percent because
of lower unit prices. This was, however, an
improvement over 1998 when sales declined by
16.7 percent. Consumer sentiment improved as
a result of recovery in asset prices, which moderated the negative wealth effect seen in the
previous year. However, private consumption
expenditure increased by a modest 1.1 percent
in 1999 because of high unemployment, low
wage growth, and continuing economic uncertainty that dampened consumer demand.

Although the unemployment rate stabilized in the second quarter of 1999 at 6 percent, it is still double the precrisis level of
3 percent. The construction subsector continued to have the highest unemployment rate of
12.7 percent, followed by manufacturing
(7.2 percent), and wholesale/retail trade
(6.5 percent). The continued strong growth of
the labor force worsened the problem. The labor
force participation rate also increased with more
women seeking employment.

Inflation: With the economy still undergoing structural adjustments, the downward trendRegional and Country Highlights

69

 

in prices was more pronounced in 1999 than in
1998. Deflation, as shown by the composite
consumer price index (CPI), was 4 percent in
1999. Fierce price competition, flat rental
charges, and a freeze on government fees and
most public utility charges contributed to the
fall in the CPI. Continuing weak prices of
world commodities (except fuel), a strong
dollar, and deflation in the PRC minimized
imported inflation.

External sector: The visible trade deficit narrowed further and the invisible trade surplus
expanded in the first half of 1999. There were
significant rebounds in the reexports to and
from Asia, particularly to and from Indonesia,
Japan, Republic of Korea, and Singapore. After
five quarters of negative growth, reexports increased by 6.8 percent and 11.8 percent in the
third and fourth quarters, respectively, following the pickup in export growth in the PRC after
mid-1999. With export and import prices generally falling and moving in line with each other,
the terms of trade did not change significantly.
The structural shift from domestic exports to
reexports and to offshore trading between the
PRC and other countries has implications for
the future of Hong Kong, China as an entry port
for the PRC. However, the projected entry of
the PRC into the World Trade Organization is
expected to present new trade service-related
opportunities for Hong Kong, China as the
integration of the PRC economy with the global
economy increases.

Domestic policies: Consolidation in the
finance sector after the Asian financial crisis has
generally been in the right direction, with the
Government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) promoting the
drive for more transparency, liberalization, and
better regulations. Following the completion of
the Banking Sector Consultancy Study in
December 1998 and taking into account the
views received during the public consultation
conducted in early 1999, the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority developed a coherent package of policy initiatives to reform and further
develop the banking subsector in Hong Kong,
China. Reforms involve deregulating the
remaining interest rate rules, relaxing the onebranch policy, implementing a formalized

 

risk-based supervisory approach, simplifying
he three-tier licensing system, conducting a full
study on deposit protection, and evaluating the
easibility of establishing a credit register for
commercial enterprises in Hong Kong, China.
The severe recession in 1998 caused the
Government of HKSAR to change its fiscal stance
rom a balanced budget in FY1998/99 (ending
31 March) to a deficit for both FY1999/2000 and
FY2000/2001. The deficit for FY1999/2000 is
estimated at HK$1.6 billion (0.1 percent of
GDP), lower than the HK$36.1 billion (3.0 percent of GDP) originally estimated and the actual
iscal deficit recorded at 1.8 percent of GDP
(HK$23.2 billion) in FY1998/99. As a convenion, the ratio of total government expenditure
0 GDP is capped at 20 percent. The education
subsector continued to receive the largest share
(21 percent) of total government recurrent
expenditure; but the biggest increase in allocaion went to social welfare, followed by housing and community affairs. To control
expenditure and enhance civil service producivity, the Government of HKSAR imposed a
reeze on civil service pay and on hiring into
he permanent civil service. A new initiative
aken to boost private sector demand was the
0 percent tax rebate on salaries, profits, and
roperty. Reforms in both the education and
ealth care subsectors were also undertaken.
Environmental issues received increasing
riority from the Government.

 

 

Republic of Korea

Economic performance

Economic growth: Just a year after resorting to
a rescue package led by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the Republic of Korea's
economy recovered quickly. Reflecting the consistent finance and corporate sector restructuring and favorable export environment, the GDP
growth rate reached 10.7 percent in 1999, which
was in sharp contrast to the 6.7 percent contraction in 1998, and was the highest GDP
growth rate achieved since 1988. Responding
to higher export and domestic consumer
demand, the manufacturing subsector led theANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

 

recovery. On the demand side, the rapid
increase in private consumption, facility, and
equipment investment, and slower pace of
inventory reduction, contributed to the recovery. The economic recovery led to a decline in
the unemployment rate to 4.8 percent by
December 1999, after peaking at 8.6 percent in
February 1999. While the rise in employment
was led by the manufacturing subsector, the
growth of new businesses in the services
subsector also contributed to the decline in the
unemployment rate. However, the unemployment rate is still higher than the precrisis level
of 2-3 percent, and the share of transitory
employment grew in 1999.

Inflation: Despite expansionary economic
policy and rapid economic recovery, prices were
stable. The inflation rate dropped from 7.5 percent in 1998 to 0.8 percent in 1999, which is
the lowest level in recent Korean history. The
Korean won contributed significantly to this
deflationary trend.

External sector: Economic conditions dramatically improved in 1999. Foreign exchange
liquidity recovered rapidly. As a result of the
high interest rate policy, domestic demand collapsed, and the current account recorded a
$41 billion surplus in 1998. The surplus contributed to the rapid accumulation of usable
foreign exchange reserves from less than
$10 billion at the end of 1997 to more than
$74 billion at the end of 1999. As the foreign
exchange liquidity improved, the exchange rate
stabilized to 1,150 won to the US dollar by
December 1999, compared with 1,700 won to
the US dollar in January 1998. Exports, which
declined sharply in 1998, picked up in 1999,
reflecting the yen appreciation and the recovering Asian markets. As in the past, heavy and
chemical industries were the leading exports.
The value of imports expanded rapidly with the
recovery of domestic demand. While exports
increased by 10.0 percent in 1999, imports grew
by 29.0 percent. In addition, the deficit in
nontrade accounts such as service and interest
payments widened from $1 billion in 1998 to
around $3.7 billion in 1999. As a result, the
current account surplus decreased from $41 billion (13.0 percent of GDP) in 1998 to $25 billion (6.0 percent of GDP) in 1999. The capital

account showed a surplus of $0.6 billion in
1999, despite the repayment of the IMF
emergency loan of $11 billion. The Republic of
Korea had net inflow for nondebt instruments,
such as foreign direct investment (FDI) and
equity investment in 1999 as a result of the
policy requiring chaebols (conglomerates) to
reduce their debt-equity ratio.

Domestic policies: The Government maintained the expansionary policy stance adopted
in mid-1998 to stimulate the economy. It was
initially planned to increase the budget by
5-6 percent from the 1998 level, with the
expectation of an overall fiscal deficit of 5 percent of GDP. The Government twice increased
the budget during the 1999 fiscal year. As a
result, fiscal expenditure increased by 9.7 percent above the 1998 level, which itself exceeded
the 1997 level by 13.5 percent. Main contributors to the expansion were support for finance
and corporate subsector restructuring, strengthening of social safety nets, and increased
investment in infrastructure. Nevertheless, the
rapid recovery enabled the Government to
reduce the fiscal deficit to 2.9 percent of GDP
for the year. For monetary policy, the Central
Bank lowered short-term interest rates until
May 1999. By that time, economic recovery had
begun to gather considerable momentum. The
call rate was maintained below 5 percent for
the rest of the year. Because it had adopted a
free floating exchange rate system in December
1997, the Government refrained from directly
intervening in the foreign exchange market
except to smooth out fluctuations.

During the last two years, with significant
financial assistance from multilateral development finance institutions, the Republic of Korea
has made considerable progress in reforming
and restructuring the domestic finance and corporate sectors. In the finance sector, many nonviable financial institutions have been closed,
viable institutions have been recapitalized,
prudential regulations and supervision of the
sector have been strengthened, and information disclosure and transparency standards have
been improved.

governance. Capital adequacy ratios of banks
are now more than 8 percent, debt-equity
ratios of most large chaebols have been
reduced, more than 87 percent of the crossguarantees between the affiliates of the top
30 chaebols have been phased out, rights of
minority shareholders in companies have
been strengthened, and chaebols are now
required to present consolidated financial
statements. In summary, substantial progress
has been attained in implementing reforms
in the finance and corporate sectors; however, more needs to be done particularly in
the corporate sector.

Project implementation: ADB's Financial Sector
Program Loan (FSPL) of $4 billion was to be
disbursed in four tranches. The first tranche
($2.0 billion), second tranche ($1.0 billion), and
third tranche ($0.7 billion) were released in
December 1997, January 1998, and December
1998, respectively. The fourth tranche of
$300 million was scheduled to be released in
December 1999. However, in view of the
improved economic situation, the Government,
despite meeting all the conditionalities, did not
draw the last tranche. ADB closely monitored
the implementation of the FSPL through its
Seoul-based Extended Mission and several
missions from headquarters.

Singapore
Economic performance

Economic growth: Singapore's economy
rebounded strongly from a nearly stagnant level
in 1998 to a GDP growth of 5.4 percent in 1999.
Much of the growth momentum in 1999 was
led by the manufacturing subsector, reflecting
strong external demand for telecommunications
equipment, semiconductors, and computers
and computer peripherals. The nonelectronic
segment of manufacturing also performed well,
with chemical output up sharply, reflecting
improved global demand for industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Value added in the
construction subsector, however, continued to
decline, mainly because of a sharp drop in private construction activity, as developers
remained cautious in view of excess capacity
in both residential and nonresidential markets.
In 1999, the services subsector also staged a
recovery. Besides the positive impact on the
transport and communications sector,
increased regional trade flows and tourist
arrivals also boosted the wholesale and retail
trade, and hotel and restaurant subsectors.
Recovery in domestic demand also supported
the latter two subsectors. The financial services
sector also benefited from a recovery in investor
sentiment toward regional equity markets andANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

 

improved regional demand for insurance and
investment advice.

Despite the strong rebound in economic
activity and a pickup in investment commitments in the second half of the year, overall
fixed investment contracted further in 1999,
largely because of sluggish construction.
Bank lending, other than for housing loans,
remained weak and lagged behind the
recovery in industrial production.

In tandem with the recovery in the
domestic economy, labor demand strengthened
in 1999, with gains in employment in the services and manufacturing subsectors more than
compensating for declines in construction. Job
vacancy and recruitment rates increased as well.
However, retrenchments remained relatively
high, with more than half coming from lowerend manufacturing operations, such as the disk
drive segment that has been affected by industrial restructuring. As a result of increased
retrenchments, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate increased to 4.0 percent in
September 1999. This was down from the
December 1998 rate of 4.4 percent.

Inflation: Having declined by 0.2 percent
in 1998, and a further 0.6 percent in the first
quarter of 1999, CPI inflation rate picked up
from the second quarter of 1999 because of
higher food prices and transportation and communication costs. Inflation in 1999, however,
remained subdued at 0.4 percent because of
benign global inflation and wage restraint.

External sector: Singapore's trade surplus
narrowed in 1999 from its 1998 record levels.
Although stronger regional and robust US
growth pushed up demand for Singapore's electronic goods, this was more than offset by a
higher rate of import growth because of
renewed consumer confidence and a need to
replenish depleted stocks of raw materials and
intermediate goods. The services subsector surplus picked up as tourist arrivals to Singapore
increased, and a rise in intraregional trade led
to greater demand for Singapore's shipping
services. In addition, financial services exports
increased as the recovery in Singapore's stock
market led to increased brokering services to
nonresidents. As a result, Singapore's current
account surplus rose in 1999. However, a

smaller deficit on the capital and financial
accounts, resulting from lower net outflows in
portfolio investment, enabled Singapore to
maintain its stock of reserves at around
$77 billion or a healthy 8.2 months of imports.

Domestic policies: Singapore was among
the least crisis-affected economies in the region.
The country liberalized further its finance sector while maintaining cost competitiveness and
remaining an attractive destination for foreign
investment. Business operating costs in the
economy were reduced by lowering various
government levies, providing tax rebates, and
reducing employer contributions to the Central
Provident Fund.

Taipei,China
Economic performance

Economic growth: With robust export performance, the economy of Taipei,China began to
recover from the impact of the Asian financial
crisis and registered a rebounding GDP growth
rate of 5.7 percent in 1999 from 4.6 percent in
1998. Economic activity picked up largely
because of a surge in exports of electronic,
information, and communications products
emanating from an upturn in the global demand
related to year 2000 (Y2K) compliance requirements. Export growth declined temporarily
because of the adverse effect of the September
earthquake. Nevertheless, the industry sector
expanded by 4.7 percent in 1999 from 3.2 percent in 1998. Good weather conditions contributed to the recovery of the agriculture sector
from a decline of 6.6 percent in 1998 to a growth
of 0.4 percent in 1999. Adversely affected by the
problem-ridden banking subsector and lackluster stock market, the services subsector growth
declined from 6.2 percent in 1998 to 5.7 percent
in 1999. Despite the relatively rapid growth in
aggregate demand, domestic demand was weak
compared with previous years. Fixed capital formation growth slowed in 1999, while capacity
utilization rates in the manufacturing subsector
were higher than the historical average.
Inflation: Prices remained stable throughout 1999. While international oil prices wentRegional and Country Highlights

73

 

up, the decline in the world prices for other key
stable commodities, the appreciation of the New
Taiwan (NT) dollar, the reduction in import
tariffs, and stable nontraded goods prices, such
as housing rents and communications charges,
held domestic prices down. In addition, good
weather conditions, which resulted in the
decline in food prices, also helped to contain
inflation. The CPI inflation rate was low, at
0.2 percent in 1999. Import prices went down
by 4.1 percent, and wholesale prices contracted
by 4.5 percent.

External sector: Boosted by the strength of
the technology subsector, exports increased by
10 percent in 1999, while imports of industrial
raw materials and capital goods picked up and
imports of consumer goods remained sluggish.
Recovering Asian economies, sustained US economic expansion, and increasing global demand
for electronic products—which led to a surge
in exports of electronic, information, and communication products—were the main forces
behind the rise in exports. Reflecting vigorous
export growth, the trade surplus increased to
$10.9 billion in 1999, compared with $5.9 billion in 1998. In 1999, Taipei,China's current
account surplus rose to $5.9 billion, the financial account gained a net inflow of $13.0 billion, and the overall balance-of-payments
surplus reached $18.6 billion.

Domestic policies: The continuous inflow
of foreign capital, the expansion in the trade
surplus, and the active transactions in the stock
market led to an increase in M2 growth in the
first half of 1999. Since July, the growth rate of
M2 declined, reflecting a slowdown in bank
lending and investments. The average growth
rate of M2 was 8.3 percent in 1999, close to the
midpoint of the target range of 6-11 percent.
The money supply supported the needs for
funding domestic economic activities.

During the year, the Central Bank lowered
the rediscount rate, issued certificates of
deposits for redeposits taken from the postal
savings system, and engaged in open market
operations. As a result, monetary conditions in
the domestic banking system were moderately

 

easy and the overnight interbank call-loan rate
remained between 4.7 and 4.9 percent. Deposit
and loan rates by banks were lowered. For
example, the weighted average of interest rates
on new loans, made by the five major banks,
dropped from 7.6 percent at the end of 1998 to
6.9 percent at the end of 1999.

The Brazilian financial crisis and expectations of renminbi depreciation in January 1999
had a deflationary effect on the NT dollar. The
NT dollar depreciated further in February in
response to the depreciation of the Japanese
yen. Since mid-April, the NT dollar appreciated
because of continuous inflows of foreign capital, expanding trade surpluses, and increasing
conversion of foreign currency deposits into NT
dollars. As of the end of 1999, the NT dollar
had appreciated against the US dollar by 2.6 percent over that of the previous year.

Central Asian republics!
and Mongolia

Economic growth and prosperity in the
economies of Central Asia and Mongolia depend
on their successful transition from command
to market economies. In early 1999, however,
these countries were adversely affected by the
Russian financial crisis that began in August
1998. Trade volumes declined, foreign direct
investment fell, exchange rates destabilized, and
external debt obligations rose. As a result, economic growth slowed, macroeconomic stabilization was interrupted, and structural reform
efforts were hampered.

The economic situation in Central Asia and
Mongolia remains precarious, but there were
signs of recovery by the middle of 1999 as the
effects of the Russian financial crisis began to
recede, and currencies began to stabilize. GDP
growth in the subregion in 1999 improved to
2.9 percent from 0.8 percent in 1998. Uzbekistan
recorded the highest growth at 4.4 percent,
followed by Tajikistan at 3.7 percent, Kyrgyz
Republic at 3.6 percent, and Mongolia at
3.5 percent. After contracting by 1.9 percent in

1 Central Asian republics include Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Azerbaijan joined

ADB in December 1999.ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

1998, Kazakhstan's economy began to stage a recovery in 1999, with GDP growth at 1.7 percent.
The effects of the crisis on the CARs and
Mongolia were attenuated by the increasing
diversification of trade from the former
Soviet republics as a result of liberalizing their
trade regimes. With the exception of Uzbekistan,
which maintains a restrictive trade regime and
limits access to foreign exchange, the CARs and
Mongolia have significantly opened their economies. Mongolia, in particular, now has one of
the most liberal trade regimes in the world. Most
of the countries, however, still depend highly
on a few primary commodities for their export
earnings. As the prices of these commodities
have been volatile in recent years, so have the
countries’ export earnings. There is a pressing
need to diversify further the range of goods that
are traded to reduce the vulnerability to shocks
in world markets. Accelerated privatization is
the best way to achieve this diversification.
Privatization efforts have been mixed. Land
reform and the privatization of small enterprises
have generally proceeded well while the
privatization of large state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) has lagged for a variety of reasons,
including unrealistic pricing, reluctance of
governments to cede a majority stake, and
problems of transparency. Mongolia has about
60 percent of its GDP produced in the private
sector, while in Tajikistan the figure is only
30 percent of GDP. Efforts need to be redoubled

 
  
   
   
    

Rates

to accelerate the privatization of large SOEs as
a way of fostering rapid economic growth and
attracting needed foreign investment.
Strengthening regional economic cooperation is also important for realizing the
development objectives of the CARs and
Mongolia. The economic integration of the CARs
within the former Soviet Union, with its focus
on Moscow, resulted in inadequate investments
in infrastructure to promote inter-republican
trade and integration following independence.
Moreover, these republics are sparsely populated and have low per capita incomes, resulting in limited internal markets for domestically
produced goods. Economic growth and poverty
reduction in the region will, therefore, depend
on developing new trading relations within the
region, and new trading partners and transport
links to external markets. The creation of several economic cooperation institutions, such as
the Central Asian Bank for Cooperation and
Development, as well as bilateral trade agreements, already demonstrates a commitment to
economic cooperation and an appreciation by
the region's governments that common solutions must be found to regional problems.

Kazakhstan

Economic performance

Economic growth: In 1999, the economy
showed signs of recovery from the recession
caused by the Russian crisis in mid-August 1998.
GDP grew by about 1.7 percent in 1999, compared with a contraction of 1.9 percent of GDP
in 1998. The economic recovery, which occurred
in the second half of 1999, was mainly attributed to a bumper harvest, a rebound in industrial production, an increase in capital
investment, and rising world prices of
Kazakhstan's major export commodities. The
agriculture sector grew substantially as the
country achieved a good grain harvest with
favorable weather conditions. The output of
grain for 1999 totaled 15.9 million tons, significantly higher than the output of 12.4 million tons in 1997 and 6.4 million tons in 1998.
The industry sector output rose mainly becauseRegional and Country Highlights

75

 

production of crude oil and natural gas
rebounded in response to increases in world
prices. Because of the expansion in capital
investment, construction activities remained
strong in 1999, assisted by the continuing
building and refurbishing of the new capital city
of Astana.

Inflation: Inflation reached about 17.8 percent in 1999. This was significantly higher than
the inflation rate of 1.9 percent in 1998 mainly
because of the effect of the tenge devaluation.
However, inflation subsided in the second half
of 1999 because of the bumper harvest and the
Government's prudent fiscal policy. When the
Government floated the tenge in April 1999, the
exchange rate depreciated sharply. However, it
stabilized in the second half of the year following the recovery of the real sector and growth
of exports.

External sector: The balance-of-payments
situation improved in 1999, with a sharp
reduction in current account deficit. The current
account deficit shrank to 1.7 percent of GDP in
1999 from 5.5 percent of GDP in 1998 as imports
contracted sharply in response to the devaluation. In 1999, exports decreased by 4.8 percent
while imports fell by 28.2 percent. Kazakhstan
continued to shift its trade away from the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
countries, particularly Russia, to non-CIS countries. In 1999, the share of CIS countries in total
exports was 28 percent and in total imports was
43 percent, compared with 45 percent and
49 percent, respectively, in 1998. FDI declined
in 1999, reflecting the negative impact of the
Russian crisis. As the first CIS country to return
to the global capital markets after the breakou
of the Russian crisis, Kazakhstan issued, from
September to November 1999, its third international bond of $300 million, which was wel.
received. Gross international reserves fell in the
first half of 1999, but increased in the second
half of the year because of the growth in exports.
By the end of 1999, gross international reserves
totaled $1.8 billion, equivalent to four months
ofimports. External debt, which was equivalen
to 18 percent of GDP, remained manageable.

Domestic policies: The authorities made
strong efforts to control the crisis, promote
economic recovery, and accelerate structura

 

 

reforms in 1999. A tight fiscal policy was largely
in place to keep the budget deficit under control.
Measures were undertaken to improve revenue
collection and limit expenditures. A more
prudent government budget for 2000 was
prepared and approved by the Parliament. To
stimulate recovery of the real economy, the
National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) reduced its
refinance rate three times during 1999 and
canceled the requirement that exporters must
sell 50 percent of their export earnings to NBK.
Kazakhstan imposed tariffs of 200 percent on
imports from the Kyrygz Republic and banned
food imports from Russia in early 1999, but the
ban was lifted in June and the tariffs on most
imports from the Kyrgyz Republic were removed
in September. The tenge was floated in April to
lessen the negative impact of the Russian crisis
and improve the competitiveness of exports. In
November, the Government drew up an
economic development program for 2000-2002,
which will focus on promoting economic
growth, reducing inflation and the budget
deficit, and further liberalizing the trade system.
The Government's program has obtained
support from IMF under the three-year
Extended Fund Facility program, which was
approved in December.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: The main objectives of
ADB's operational strategy in Kazakhstan
include (i) encouraging the transition to a
market-based economy by supporting the
Government's reform agenda, promoting
institutional change, and strengthening social
protection; (ii) promoting the rehabilitation of
the environment; (iii) strengthening the longterm potential for sustainable growth; and
(iv) encouraging the creation of a new output
structure and new production capacity through
private sector investment. Cofinancing with other
funding agencies is actively sought to address
difficulties in sourcing local counterpart funds.

Kazakhstan's development needs are vast,
but ADB's resources and experience in working
with the country are limited. Moreover, other
funding agencies provide extensive support and
technical assistance. Therefore, ADB activitiesANNUAL REPORT 1999

will focus on a few strategic sectors and
subsectors to maximize development impacts:
(i) strengthened management of reform at the
central and local government levels; (ii) infrastructure, particularly rehabilitation projects;
(iii) education and training; (iv) industry, focusing on the problems of reforming medium-sized
enterprises; and (v) agriculture. In implementing this strategy, several strategic considerations must be addressed, including
coordination with other multilateral development finance institutions.

Policy dialogue: Apart from existing
projects, ADB and the Government have initiated new areas of policy dialogue, especially in
roads and agriculture in line with ADB's focus.
The main focus in the road subsector includes
promoting cross-border movements of goods
and services. In the agriculture sector,
privatization of land and postprivatization farm
restructuring are priorities. Although progress
is slow in both as economic difficulties continue, policy dialogue is expected to lead to ADB
interventions in the near future.

Kyrgyz Republic
Economic performance

Economic growth: Preliminary data indicate that
real GDP grew by 3.6 percent. Although faster
than the 2.1 percent recorded for 1998 when
the Russian crisis first broke out, it remains to
be seen if the existing rate can be sustained. As
in 1998, the agriculture sector led with growth
of 8.7 percent; production of all major crops
increased—except for a slight decrease in the
production of grain and wheat—mainly due to
favorable weather conditions. Industry sector
production continued to be weak, declining by
2.4 percent, and Kumtor gold production also
decreased. Meanwhile the services subsector
edged up by 1.8 percent.

Inflation: Despite a continued tight
monetary policy, as evidenced by a decline in
both M1 and M2, the CPI rose by about 40 percent in 1999, more than double that for 1998.
Since the fourth quarter of 1998, inflation has
been on the rise, mostly because of a weak som.
The weakness of the som is, in turn, caused
by a continued lack of public confidence,
triggered by the Russian crisis of August 1998.
In 1999, the som depreciated by 35 percent
against the US dollar, subsequent to an earlier
loss of 32 percent between end-August and
end-December 1998. Public confidence was
further shaken by a major financial fraud that
involved most of the country’s large commercial banks. A swift and satisfactory resolution
of the case would be a major boost to public
confidence in the finance sector and the
currency.

External sector: In 1999, total external trade
declined by about 25 percent relative to the
same period in 1998. Both imports and exports
decreased; however, imports decreased faster
as a direct consequence of the large depreciation of the som. As a result, both trade and
current account balances improved, with the
latter at negative 12.0 percent of GDP. International reserves also rose to an import cover of
more than four months. External debt, public
and publicly guaranteed, stood at $1.3 billion
at the end of 1999, an increase of $156 million
over December 1998.

 

Domestic policies: The year 1999 was a
difficult one for the Kyrgyz Republic. While the
country made major efforts and showed great
resolve in reaching agreement with IMF to bring
the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
program back on track in early 2000, the
Government was faced with serious challenges
in macro stabilization and structural reforms.
On the structural side, slow progress was made
in promoting private sector development, and
privatization of large SOEs continued to lag
behind expectations. Major government
efforts—including privatization and restructuring—are needed to accelerate the growth of the
private sector, considered to be the engine of
growth in the long run. These measures along
with reforms in the finance and other sectors
will not be easy to implement in view of the
forthcoming parliamentary and presidential
elections in 2000.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: The primary objective of
ADB's operational strategy in the Kyrgyz
Republic is to facilitate the country's transition
to a market economy and to help the country
build a solid base for sustainable development.
The basic elements of the strategy include
(i) supporting the Government's reform agenda,
encouraging institutional change, and strengthening social protection; (ii) arresting the rapid
deterioration of economic potential by investing in physical infrastructure and human
development; and (iii) encouraging the creation
of a new output structure and new production
capacity through private sector investment and
job creation. The strategy concentrates on four
priority areas: (i) improving public services,
particularly social services provided by local
governments, and management of reform by
the central Government; (ii) agriculture,
including rural finance; (iii) human resource
development; and (iv) infrastructure, especially
in the road and energy sectors. In early 1999,
ADB revised its strategy to include selected
interventions in the finance sector. This revision was necessary following the severe adverse
effects of the Russian financial crisis and a major
financial fraud.ANNUAL REPORT 1999

Policy dialogue: ADB continued dialogue
with the Government on supporting policy and
institutional reforms in the finance, infrastructure, and agriculture sectors. In addition, ADB
began dialogue with the Government on
formulating and implementing a poverty
reduction strategy in line with the Government's
long-term development goal and ADB's
objective of reducing poverty. ADB also assisted
the Government in implementing the Comprehensive Development Framework.

Loans and technical assistance: Three
loans for two projects totaling $72 million were
approved for the Kyrgyz Republic: $36 million

for the program loan and technical assistance
loan for the finance sector, and a project loan
for the agriculture sector amounting to $36 million. ADB also approved six technical assistance
grants totaling $2.9 million.

Project implementation: Since becoming a
member of ADB in 1994, the Kyrgyz Republic
has received a total of 15 loans, of which 3 were
closed and 12 were still active at the end of 1999.
Contracts worth $89.7 million were awarded
during the year, bringing the cumulative total
of contracts to $271.8 million. The contract
award ratio for 1999 was 45.7 percent. Disbursements for the year totaled $79.6 million,
bringing cumulative disbursements to
$235.0 million. The disbursement ratio for 1999
was 41.5 percent.

Despite some difficulties in providing
counterpart funding, project implementation
was generally satisfactory. While the implementation of a few projects picked up significantly
during the year, a project in the power subsector
continued to suffer from a weak financial
performance of the executing agency; a concrete
action plan was therefore formulated to aim
at financial recovery and organizational
restructuring. A country project and administration seminar was held in September to
familiarize the staff of executing agencies and
other government offices with ADB's
procedures and guidelines on procurement,
consulting services, and disbursement with
reference to the anticorruption policy. ADB
approved establishing in the Kyrgyz Republic
a resident mission, which is expected to
become operational in early 2000.

Economic performance

Economic growth: In 1999, GDP grew by
3.7 percent, lower than the 1998 growth rate of
5.3 percent and the original 1999 projection of
5.5 percent. The decline in the growth rate
reflects the adverse effects of the Russian
financial crisis, deterioration in the country's
terms of trade, and weather damage to
agricultural crops. The growth rate reflects aRegional and Country Highlights

79

 

mixed performance across sectors of the
economy. The industry sector grew by 5.0 percent in 1999, led by increased production of
aluminum, electricity, wood and timber, and
printing. Gross production of consumer goods,
however, declined by 15 percent, and transport
services declined by 6 percent. The agriculture
sector grew by 3.8 percent. However, production
of important agricultural crops declined. In the
cotton subsector, the fall in prices since April
1998 led to the country's inability to adhere
to the terms of an international loan agreement that financed the 1998 crop. As a result,
external financing was not available in 1999,
thereby limiting credit to the agriculture
sector for the purchase of inputs, especially
fuel and spare parts for farm machinery.
Moreover, rains and flooding damaged much
of the 1999 crop. The 1999 harvest thus declined
by 17.6 percent despite initial hopes of a large
increase. Grain production also fell by 20 percent because of bad weather and limited
financing for inputs.

Inflation: Despite an impressive decrease
in inflation in 1998 to 2.7 percent after extremely
high inflation rates in the previous three years,
prices rose by 24.0 percent in 1999. Renewed
inflation resulted from the steep depreciation
of the Tajik ruble against the US dollar in the
wake of the Russian financial crisis; an expansion in domestic credits to the cotton industry,
Tajik Rail, the national oil company, and the
Government; a rise in the prices of bread (following the bad grain harvest) and imported fuel;
and administrative price hikes, including a new
excise tax on gasoline and increases in the price
of electricity.

External sector: Tajikistan's current account
deficit declined significantly in 1999 to
2.8 percent of GDP, compared with 8.8 percent
in 1998. The decline reflected both a decrease
in imports and an increase in exports, following the depreciation of the Tajik ruble. Aluminum exports, in particular, have largely
recovered as world market prices began to rise
again. Cotton exports, however, remained low
in 1999. Gross international reserves fell to
$41 million, equivalent to 1.0 month of imports
by the end of the third quarter of 1999, down
from $65 million or 1.5 months of imports at

the end of 1998. However, gross international
reserves are expected to rise as the current
account deficit continues to narrow. Tajikistan's
external debt remains high. In April 1999, however, Russia agreed to reduce Tajikistan's debt
by more than 50 percent. Debt reduction or
rescheduling agreements were also signed with
several other countries. As a result, total debt
service fell from $41 million in 1998 to
$29 million in 1999.

Domestic policies: Tajikistan's three-year
IMF reform program was largely on track
through the first two quarters of 1999, particularly in terms of GDP growth and inflation. However, its current account deficit during the
period was higher than expected because of the
dual external shocks of the Russian financial
crisis and the deteriorating terms of trade.
Moreover, because taxes on the sale of cotton
represent a significant source of government
revenue, the government deficit was also higher
than expected. In the third quarter, the budget
deficit increased further because of weak tax
administration and increased capital outlays.
The Government took strong corrective measures in the fourth quarter, however, intensifying revenue collection and rationalizing
expenditures. As a result, the budget deficit fell
to 3.1 percent of GDP in 1999, compared with
3.8 percent in 1998. Payments to the poor from
the Government's Cash Compensation Program,
however, were significantly less than expected
in 1999 because few eligible people claimed the
eroded benefit. This indicated a further deterioration of Tajikistan's already fragile social
safety net. Reforms of the social safety net are
urgently needed.

The private sector still accounted for less
than a third of Tajikistan's GDP. While the
privatization of the country's small SOEs is
now complete, progress remains slow in
privatizing medium and large SOEs. Privatization of the state's cotton ginning factories,
an important aspect of the Government's
privatization program, faces problems.
Twenty-three factories were offered for sale
in 1999, but only seven have been sold. The
Government needs to redouble its efforts to
privatize its large SOEs and appraise market
prices realistically.ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

 

The peace process progressed significantly
in 1999. Continued progress remains the most
critical factor in creating and maintaining a
stable macroeconomic environment conducive
to growth and prosperity.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's interim operational
strategy for Tajikistan is aimed at (i) facilitating the country's transition to a market
economy, (ii) assisting in its postconflict
rehabilitation and reconstruction, and (iii) providing support for natural disaster rehabilitation. ADB will promote development of small
and medium enterprises and assist in reducing
poverty, particularly for households headed by
women and communities in remote mountainous areas. To maximize the development impact
of ADB's assistance, the strategy focuses on
three priority areas: (i) agriculture and
agroprocessing; (ii) infrastructure rehabilitation,
especially roads and power, and (iii) education.
Since the strategy was prepared in 1998, ADB has
undertaken a detailed social sector review. To
respond to the Government's request and assist
in mitigating the continued deterioration of social
indicators, support has been broadened to include
health, social protection, and education.

Policy dialogue: The Government and ADB
continued dialogue on the range of reforms in
the energy and transport sectors as agreed upon
under the Postconflict Infrastructure Program.
ADB also supported the Government in establishing a Law Reform Commission and in preparing
new energy and transport laws. ADB worked
closely with the Government to produce a substantive environment profile of Tajikistan that will
assist in guiding ADB's future support. Agreement
was also reached with the Government to
strengthen its capacity to respond effectively to
serious recurrent flooding and landslides.

Loans and technical assistance: Two loans
were approved in 1999 totaling $25 million. The
Social Sector Rehabilitation Project will assist
in reactivating the delivery of essential social
services in education, health, and social
protection. ADB also responded to the severe
flooding that occurred throughout Tajikistan in
1999 by approving an Emergency Flood

Rehabilitation Project. Seven technical assistance grants were approved, totaling $3.8 million.

Project implementation: Since Tajikistan
became a member in 1998, a total of three loans
and nine technical assistance grants amounting to $45 million and $5.5 million, respectively,
have been approved. ADB's first loan to the
country for the Postconflict Infrastructure Program, approved in December 1998, became
effective in February 1999 with the release of
the first tranche of $9.9 million. In 1999, ADB
approved its second and third loans, which had
not become effective by the end of the year.
Total contract awards amounted to $9.9 million, and the contract award ratio was 24.3 percent. Cumulative disbursements amounted to
$9.9 million, and the disbursement ratio was
49.4 percent. Project implementation in
Tajikistan presents particular logistic and
security challenges and will need to take
account of the weak fiscal position and institutional capacity of the Government. In the first
phase ofits operations, ADB has received strong
support and cooperation from both the World
Bank and the United Nations (UN). World Bank
logistical support was instrumental in enabling
an early start to ADB's operations. The cooperation has continued with a joint mission to
process assistance in response to the July 1999
floods. Following the signing of an agreement
with the United Nations (UN), ADB is participating in the security arrangements for staff and
consultants organized by the UN Mission of
Observers in Tajikistan. The second loan for
the Social Sector Rehabilitation Project, for
which special arrangements were also made,
would engage the UN Office for Project
Services as an implementing agency for the
initial stages of the project.

Uzbekistan

Economic performance

Economic growth: In 1999, real GDP grew by
4.4 percent despite the difficult macroeconomic
environment and the adverse effects of the
Russian crisis. Economic growth was spurred
mainly by the growth of the agriculture sectorRegional and Country Highlights

81

 

that increased by 5.9 percent in 1999, compared with a 4.0 percent increase in 1998. The
strong performance of the agriculture sector
was due to better weather conditions and the
implementation of agricultural reforms during the year, which improved the overall
incentive structure for farmers. Economic
growth was also assisted by the growth of the
industry sector at 6.1 percent, and the services
sector at 11.5 percent.

Inflation: Despite the tight monetary and
fiscal policies maintained by the Government
during the year, the inflation rate for 1999 was
26 percent mainly because of the rapid depreciation of the sum by about 27.3 percent during
the year. The officially reported inflation rate
for 1998 was 26.1 percent.

External sector: The balance of payments
remained under pressure in 1999. The Russian
crisis, another bad cotton harvest in 1998, and
falling world commodity prices contributed to
the substantial deterioration in external
balances during the year. The Government
responded by further restricting imports,
tightening access to foreign exchange, and
resorting to increased foreign borrowings to
finance public investments. The current account
deficit in 1999 was 1.3 percent of GDP, compared with 0.6 percent of GDP in 1998. Although
import compression continued, the widening of
the current account deficit was also attributed
to the 10 percent fall in total export earnings
in 1999 to $2.7 billion. Gross official reserves
stood at $1.2 billion at the end of 1999, equivalent to 5.8 months of imports, mainly because
of the large surplus in the capital account,
brought about by the presale of gold to a foreign commercial bank and drawdowns on previously contracted debt during the year. In the
capital account, total drawings in 1999
increased to $913 million, compared with
$905 million in 1998. Of some concern was the
rise in outstanding external debt that stood at
$3.8 billion (25 percent of GDP) at the end of
1999, compared with $3.2 billion (23.9 percent
of GDP) at the end of 1998. The debt service
ratio also rose to 11.0 percent in 1999, compared with 9.0 percent in 1998.

Domestic policies: Uzbekistan's long-term
growth prospects have always been promising.

 

Rich natural endowments, the stock of human
capital, and centuries of tradition in commerce
and trade will contribute to a successful
transition to a fast-growing market economy.
The realization of this potential, however, is the
central development challenge facing the
authorities.

In the last two years, the economy has
suffered from a weakness in commodity prices,
especially those of cotton and gold, its principal exports. The economy is not sufficiently
diversified and is still overdependent on a few
commodity exports. The economic crises in
Russia and Asia also dampened the economic
recovery. These external shocks prompted the
Government to adopt more restrictive trade and
exchange rate policies. As a result, the country's
macroeconomic stability is at serious risk: foreign reserves have fallen, the differential
between the official and curb market exchange
rates has widened, and the Government continued to provide directed credits through the
banking system, primarily to agriculture. To
preserve macroeconomic stability and ensure
sustained growth over the medium term, the
Government needs to accelerate the pace of
reform to develop a competitive and efficient
market system.

The main objectives of the Government
should be the revival of economic growth and
the diversification of the economy. Higher foreign exchange earnings will depend on larger
quantities of commodity exports and new export
items. The fallout of the Russian crisis has made
it clear that a diversification of the export baset is essential. Cotton and grain yields remain
ow by international standards and need
improvement. This requires far-reaching secor policy reform and greater market orientaion. Third, although the gradual reform
approach has not resulted in large-scale economic disruption, it has also not yielded high
growth or large new employment opportunities.
Finally, the diversification of the economy
remains partial; new fast-growing export secors are yet to emerge and the potential of the
raditional productive sectors has not been fully
apped. Therefore, to revive growth and diversify the economy, the reform process needs to
e accelerated.ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

 

Asignificant step toward the integration of
Uzbekistan with the world economy was
achieved when the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with the European Union came
into effect in July 1999. To boost exports, the
Government cut the profit tax from 31 percent
to 30 percent in April 1999, with higher concession given to firms with exports above 30
percent of total sales. At the same time, it also
allowed delayed payment for up to 90 days of
the value-added tax on imported goods used
in the production of exports. However, the multiple exchange rate system continued to be a
constraint on export growth. The Government's
privatization program, especially for large-scale
enterprises, appeared to have run into difficulties because of limited foreign investor interest. The Government's reluctance to offer
majority stakes to strategic investors, unrealistic price expectations, a difficult investment
environment, and the falling commodity prices
in world markets are ongoing problems.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's assistance to
Uzbekistan has been guided by an interim
operational strategy since 1995 when the country became a member of ADB. The 1999 lending and technical assistance programs were
guided by the strategy that sharply focused on
three priority areas: (i) agriculture, including

    

Annual, 1995-1999
105

60

15

financial support for small and medium agroindustrial enterprises; (ii) infrastructure, especially rehabilitation in the road and railway
subsectors; and (iii) education. However, in the
years since the drafting of the strategy, there
has been considerable change within each
sector, particularly for the policy environment.
A midterm operational strategy needs to be
developed by incorporating these changes, the
country's development priorities, and ADB's
implementation experience and lessons learned.
In this context, ADB started preparing a fullfledged country operational strategy in 1999.
The central goal of the proposed strategy is to
manage a transition to an economy that relies
upon market-based institutions to reduce poverty and improve standards of living. The new
strategy will have two major operational
objectives: managing transition, including minimizing its social costs and supporting basic
reforms, and enhancing the potential for growth
through regional cooperation, rural sector
investments, and private sector support.
Policy dialogue: In 1999, ADB initiated
intensive discussions with the Government on
policy reforms and major issues in the senior
secondary education subsector. Policy dialogue
focused on (i) enhancing curriculum relevance
and flexibility to respond to labor market
demand; (ii) exploring alternative ways of
teacher development, recruitment, and
retention; (iii) increasing financial sustainability,
cost effectiveness, and cost recovery of the
senior secondary education system, (iv) encouraging private industry participation in senior

secondary education; (v) developing a technical

secondary education. In the agriculture sector,
policy dialogue centered on (i) modifying a state
procurement system for cotton and grain,
(ii) increasing farmers! incentives in cotton
production, and (iii) restructuring farm debt.
Loans and technical assistance: No loans
were approved in 1999 because of (i) prolonged
policy dialogue on agriculture, (ii) a lack of
project preparedness in the lending pipeline,
and (iii) unsatisfactory implementation
performance of the first loan project. Technical assistance was geared toward laying the
groundwork for future sector lending projects,
policy support, and capacity building. Eight
echnical assistance grants amounting to
$3.6 million were approved in 1999 for
preparing projects in the areas of developing
basic education staff resources, developing
rural savings and credit unions, and modernizing railways.

Project implementation: Since becoming a
member of ADB in 1995, Uzbekistan has
received a total of five loans, all of which were
still active at the end of 1999. Contracts worth
$53.1 million were awarded during the year,
bringing the cumulative total to $54.5 million.
The contract award ratio for 1999 was
23.8 percent. Disbursements amounted to
$16.0 million, with cumulative disbursements
reaching $17.9 million. The disbursement ratio
for 1999 was 7.7 percent.

The Railway Rehabilitation Project, which
became effective in February 1999, showed impressive performance in terms of disbursements
and particularly in contract awards. After an
initial delay, implementation of the Rural
Enterprise Development Project improved.
However, cumbersome and bureaucratic procedures of the Government concerning procurement and disbursement adversely affected
project implementation in general. In June 1999,
ADB conducted its first country portfolio review
to identify and discuss major issues in project
implementation. Substantial efforts have been
made with the Government and executing
agencies to overcome implementation difficulties
and improve project implementation performance.

 

Mongolia

Economic performance

Economic growth: The Mongolian economy
continued to be affected negatively by external
factors, most notably the ongoing economic
instability in Russia and the continued low
international prices of Mongolia's main exports
(copper, cashmere, and gold). Real GDP posted
an estimated 3.5 percent growth, the same rate
achieved in 1998, continuing the trend of
unstable but positive real GDP growth rates for
five consecutive years since 1994. The extensive dependence of the country on exports of
primary commodities means that even small
changes in the international market prices can
affect GDP growth significantly.

Inflation: Inflation, which declined to
9.0 percent in 1998, picked up and reached
10 percent in 1999. The main items that contributed to the rising inflationary pressures in
1999 were the disruption of oil supplies from
Russia and soaring world prices of petroleum
products, as well as increased domestic prices
of food items.

External sector: The trade balance improved
in 1999 primarily as a result of the tugrik
depreciation of 18.9 percent against the US dollar. Exports declined by 2.8 percent in 1999,
while imports declined by 15.4 percent. The
trade deficit decreased from $158.1 million
(14.5 percent of GDP) in 1998 to $90.1 million
(9.0 percent of GDP) in 1999. The current
account balance also improved in 1999, as the
deficit declined to 4.7 percent of GDP, compared
with 11.9 percent in 1998. With these developments, gross international reserves of
$116.9 million increased to over 14.3 weeks of
imports at the end of 1999, compared with
8.8 weeks of imports at the end of 1998.

Domestic policies: Fiscal performance
improved in 1999, as the full impact of new
revenue measures introduced in mid-1998
became effective, and additional revenue
measures were introduced in mid-1999. In May
1998, the Government announced a package of
tax and revenue expenditure measures, including an increase in the value-added tax (VAT) rate
from 10 to 13 percent effective in September,ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

 

and an increase in petroleum excise taxes. These
measures were intended to yield budgetary
saving of about 2 percentage points of GDP on
an annual basis. Additional revenue-raising
measures, adopted by the Parliament in May
1999, included a uniform import duty of 5 percent and an excise tax on beer, with the expected
revenue impact of 1 percent of GDP in 1999.

On this basis, tax revenues increased to
19 percent of GDP in 1999, compared with
17.5 percent of GDP in 1998. However, privatization receipts remained substantially below
expectations, as the Government's efforts
were met with political resistance. As a result,
total revenues and grants declined to 26 percent of GDP in 1999, compared with 27 percent of GDP in 1998. Mainly by cutting current
expenditure, the Government managed to
reduce total expenditure to 36 percent of GDP
in 1999, compared with 39 percent of GDP in
1998. This resulted in an improvement of the
overall fiscal balance from a deficit of 11.5 percent of GDP in 1998 to a deficit of 10 percent
of GDP in 1999.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: In 1999, a new operational strategy for Mongolia was prepared,
placing poverty reduction at the same level
of importance as the need to foster economic
growth. It further emphasizes the need to
incorporate elements of good governance in
any project supported by ADB. Recognizing
the success of the first strategy to foster a
transition to a market economy, the new
strategy emphasizes the role of the private
sector in leading the economic growth process and reducing poverty.

The new strategy focuses ADB's operations
on five sectors, compared with nine sectors in
the first strategy. These sectors are (i) the
finance sector for its potential to remove the
single most important barrier to private sector's
investment and saving—the fragile and thin
banking system—and for developing microfinance schemes; (ii) the agriculture sector for
its potential to generate viable small industry
employment and income; (iii) the public sector
for its potential to reorient the machinery of

    

Annual, 1995-1999

the Government to become more conducive to
and supportive of private sector-led growth
and to improve service delivery through
devolving responsibility for public service
delivery to lower levels of the Government;
(iv) the social sector, including education,
health, and social protection; and (v) urban
development for its potential to support
health improvements and living conditions.

Policy dialogue: As one of the country's
major funding agencies, ADB was actively
engaged in policy dialogue with the
Government. Dialogue focused on public sector reform and on the finance sector, where
ADB assists with bank restructuring. Road
subsector reforms progressed, and assistance
was provided to develop a new education
policy. Significant legislative action and policy
development also took place in the housing
subsector with ADB's support. Key stakeholders, most notably the Parliament, private
sector groups, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs), were consulted and informed
of developments.

Loans and technical assistance: In 1999,
ADB approved two loans totaling $50 million
and eight technical assistance grants totaling $4.1 million. The Governance Reform
Program Loan will assist the Government in
launching a major public sector reform, while
the Second Roads Development Project will
continue the task of providing basicRegional and Country Highlights

Project implementation: Since becoming
a member of ADB in 1991, Mongolia has
received 21 loans, of which 13 were still active
at the end of 1999. During the year, contracts
amounting to $26.9 million were awarded,
bringing the cumulative total to $304.0 million. The contract award ratio for 1999 was
20.8 percent. Disbursements amounted to
$46.9 million, resulting in a cumulative total
of $289.0 million and a disbursement ratio
of 35.7 percent.

Despite economic uncertainty, fiscal constraints, and institutional weaknesses in all
sectors, ADB's portfolio in Mongolia is performing satisfactorily and implementation is
proceeding on schedule. Much of ADB's lending has been through program loans. Release
of the second tranche of program loans in the
industry, agriculture, and social infrastructure sectors demonstrated the Government's
commitment and capability to implement
difficult policy and sector reforms.

The 1999 Country Portfolio Review
Mission assessed that ADB's loan portfolio in
Mongolia is satisfactory, with the newer
projects in the portfolio—notably those
approved in 1996 and 1997 in the energy,
health, education, and urban services
subsectors—progressing well.

People's Republic of China

Economic performance

Economic growth: Amid the Asian financial
crisis, the PRC maintained robust growth.
Although the crisis caused a slowdown in
exports, a decline in FDI, and a worsening of
the capital account balance in the country's
external transactions, the PRC avoided the contagion effects of the crisis. Two sets of factors
contributed to this. First, the cautious approach
in liberalizing the capital account transactions,
a relatively modest external debt that is largely
of medium- and long-term maturity, and the
sizable official foreign exchange reserves
shielded the exchange rate from speculative
attacks. Second, at the initial signs of slowing
exports and sluggish domestic consumer
demand in the first quarter of 1998, the
Government eased both fiscal and monetary
policies, enabling the economy to maintain
robust growth. In particular, two fiscal stimulus packages—of 100 billion yuan ($12.1 billion) in 1998 and 60 billion yuan ($7.2 billion)
in 1999—pump primed public investment and
growth. After growing by 7.8 percent in 1998,
the economy maintained a robust growth of
7.1 percent in 1999.

Inflation: Domestic prices continued to
decline in 1999, reflecting weak consumer
demand, several years of bumper harvests,
overinvestment in many industries in the past,
and the overall deflationary trends in Asia following the financial crisis. After declining by
0.8 percent in 1998, the CPI declined further by
1.4 percent in 1999. At 3.0 percent, the decline
in retail prices was even sharper. As in 1998,
all major components of the CPI, except for
services, declined in 1999.

External sector: The PRC's export growth
was subdued in 1998 and the first half of 1999
because of the severe recession in Asia. Export
growth accelerated in the second half of 1999.
After limited export growth in 1998, exports
increased by 6 percent in 1999. Import growth,
after remaining weak in 1998 in the aftermath
of the financial crisis, increased by a robust
18 percent in 1999. Consequently, the trade
surplus declined from $44 billion in 1998 toANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

       

1996 1997

$29 billion in 1999. Reflecting the decline in
trade surplus, the current account surplus fell
from $29 billion in 1998 to $12 billion in 1999.

Available data indicate that capital inflows
continued to slow in 1999. For the first time
since 1990, inflows of FDI declined in 1999.
Contracted FDI declined by 19 percent and
actual FDI declined by 10 percent. Foreign
banks, which received about $4 billion in net
payments in 1998, continued to scale back their
lending to the PRC in 1999.

Despite the weakening trade and current
account balances and the decline in capital
flows, the PRC's external payments situation
continues to be comfortable. At about $155 billion, the PRC's foreign exchange reserves are
(i) more than the $148.6 billion external debt
(as of June 1999), (ii) about nine times the
short-term external debt (which constitutes
about 12 percent of the PRC's total external
debt), and (iii) equivalent to about 11 months'
imports. At less than 10 percent, the external
debt service ratio was well within prudent
limits. Both the external debt and the debt
service ratios of the PRC are low by developing
country standards.

Domestic policies: While the Government
has steered the economy through difficult times
in the aftermath of the financial crisis, some
structural weaknesses that characterize the
crisis-affected economies are also found in the
PRC. These vulnerabilities are most evident in

the finance and enterprise sectors. For
sustained growth and employment generation, the PRC needs to (i) promote an efficient private sector, and (ii) develop the legal
and regulatory framework for a market
economy.

At a strategic level, finance sector reforms
and restructuring should focus on two sets of
issues: (i) recapitalizing and strengthening the
banks, and (ii) developing a stable and sound
capital market that promotes efficiency in
resource allocation and the intermediation
process.

Many problems in the finance sector are
related to ailing SOEs that account for a large
portion of nonperforming loans with banks.
Two of the most difficult SOE reform issues are
(i) putting in place alternative methods of providing the social security services that are provided by SOEs, and (ii) developing a strategy to
redeploy the redundant workers in a way that
keeps the resulting social costs within tolerable limits. To create the jobs necessary to
redeploy surplus labor from SOEs and to absorb
new labor market entrants, the Government needs
to adopt policies to encourage the development
of small and medium enterprises and owneroperated businesses in the private sector.

During the March 1999 annual session of
the National People's Congress, the PRC's
Constitution was amended to enhance the formal status of the private sector and offer it
greater political protection. Building on this
initiative, the key challenge is to provide equal
opportunities for the private sector relative to
the public sector. Three sets of issues need to
be addressed: (i) a legal framework that sets the
rules in a clear and transparent manner, (ii) a
regulatory framework that reduces restrictions
on the private sector, and (iii) improved private
sector access to financial resources from financial institutions and the capital market.

Asound legal framework is an essential part
of good governance in a market economy.
During the last two decades, the PRC's transition to a market economy has outpaced the
development of the legal and regulatory
framework. The Government recognizes the
weaknesses in the legal and regulatory system
and has set a target to establish an appropriateRegional and Country Highlights

87

 

framework for a market economy. A legislative
work program was adopted in 1999 to develop
or revise key economic laws and the corresponding implementing regulations.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's operational strategy
for the PRC emphasizes three broad objectives:
(i) improving economic efficiency, (ii) promoting growth to reduce poverty in poor inland
provinces, and (iii) environmental protection
and natural resource management. The pursuit
of these objectives will help maximize
employment creation, correct factor market
distortions, address market failures of rapid
growth by spreading the benefits of growth
more equitably, and reduce environmental
degradation. This strategy supports the
Government's objective of preserving social stability and maintaining public support for the
continued implementation of the reform program.
ADB will continue to assist the Government
in deepening its macroeconomic structural
reforms to remove inefficiencies. Improvements
in economic efficiency will be pursued by
adopting market-based approaches in all sectors in which ADB operates. ADB lending and
technical assistance operations will be designed to contribute to developing these
frameworks, thereby strengthening overall
macroeconomic management.

also incorporate components in traditional
economic growth projects that will have an
impact on poverty, such as feeder and market
roads in highway projects and rural electrification in power projects. While the share of ADBsupported projects in the inland provinces is
increasing, support for key projects in the
coastal provinces—especially those that
improve the environment in urban areas, address social concerns, or support the private
sector—is continuing.

In operationalizing its strategy for environmental protection and natural resource management, ADB is targeting its interventions in
six areas: (i) improving air and water quality in
urban areas; (ii) increasing efficiency and
greater diversification to cleaner sources in the
energy sector; (iii) increasing energy conservation and diffusion of clean technology processes
in the industry sector; (iv) promoting comprehensive basin planning and pollution cleanup
in rivers and lakes; (v) protecting watersheds,
conserving biodiversity, and preserving unique
ecosystems; and (vi) strengthening institutional
capacity in sectoral agencies.

Policy dialogue: The policy dialogue in 1999
between the Government and ADB covered a
broad range of areas to support the PRC's
operational program—including poverty reduction—and finance sector, social security, and
enterprise reforms.

Poverty reduction was an important part
of ADB's operations in the PRC in 1999. Loan
projects and project preparatory technical
assistance projects were designed to make an
impact on reducing poverty. To help sharpen
this focus, work began on a profile of poverty in the PRC, and an urban poverty study
will be supported with an advisory technical
assistance. ADB's future poverty reduction
efforts in the PRC will focus on medium-term
measures, such as the social security system
and capacity building, and long-term measures, such as improving infrastructure and
creating jobs in areas with a high incidence
of poverty.

ADB initiated policy dialogue to support the
Government's efforts for SOE reform. As a result,
the Government agreed that ADB would play a
lead role to support social security reforms. ADB
also provided support for dealing with
nonperforming loans and strengthening the
regulatory regimes for the capital market and
the insurance industry. To create jobs and
absorb laid-off workers from SOEs and new
labor market entrants, ADB plans to provide
strategic assistance for developing the private
sector in the PRC.

ADB provided technical assistance to
strengthen the economic legal framework by
helping formulate key laws and regulations for
the efficient functioning of a market economy.
The securities law that became effective on
1 July 1999 was drafted with ADB's assistance.
In 1999, a $1.4 million technical assistance for
the Development of Economic Laws was
approved. Two important laws to be covered
are the company law to facilitate SOE reform
and improve corporate governance, and the
bankruptcy law to ensure the efficient and
productive use of resources by closing and
restructuring the insolvent or loss-making
enterprises. Under this technical assistance,
ADB will also support the drafting of other laws
and regulations.

For environmental protection and natural
resource management, ADB loans and/or technical assistance addressed priority areas
targeted by the Government, such as water pollution control of some major river basins and
air and water pollution control in major cities.
Of six loan projects approved in 1999, two
projects (Suzhou Creek Rehabilitation and
Shanxi Environment Improvement) had environmental improvement as a primary objective.
Institutional strengthening of agencies involved
in environment and natural resource policy
planning, management, and enforcement is a
key feature of ADB's capacity-building and
policy support programs.

Loans and technical assistance: Eight loans
for six projects totaling $1.3 billion were
approved in 1999. These included two projects
in the road subsector ($500 million); one each
for flood rehabilitation (comprising three loans
totaling $330 million); two in social infrastructure ($326.5 million); and others related to
environment improvement ($102 million). A
total of 28 technical assistance grants were
approved, amounting to $19.9 million, of which
13 ($9.4 million) were for preparing new
projects, while the remaining 15 ($10.5 million)
were advisory in nature.

Project implementation: Since becoming a
member in 1986, the PRC has received a total
of 79 loans, of which 26 were closed and 53
remained active at the end of 1999. Contracts
worth $812.0 million were awarded during the
year, bringing the cumulative total contracts to
$5.3 billion. The contract award ratio for 1999
was 23.9 percent. Disbursements for the year
totaled $819.0 million, bringing cumulative
disbursements to $5.0 billion. The disbursement
ratio for 1999 was 19.3 percent.

The PRC portfolio is performing generally
well. The good performance reflects the strong
sense of project ownership among agencies
involved in the design, implementation, and
management of projects, as well as the rigorous screening process for development projects,
particularly those proposed for external assistance. Recently, however, implementation
difficulties have affected some ADB-financed
projects in the PRC. Loans approved in 1998
experienced average delays of about nineRegional and Country Highlights

89

 

months before being declared effective. Delays
in implementation have resulted in a deterioration of PRC's disbursement performance in
1999. These delays reflect the fact that ADB has
been shifting its lending geographically to
inland provinces whose institutions are generally less experienced in project implementation
and/or administration. Careful monitoring and
support are being provided to facilitate the
implementation of projects. A country project
implementation and administration seminar
was conducted from 28 June to 9 July 1999 in
Kunming, Yunnan Province, to familiarize
executing agency staff with ADB's procedures
and guidelines on procurement, use of consultants, and disbursements.

To learn lessons that might result in
improved portfolio performance, the Operations
Evaluation Office selected the PRC as the first
country for a broad-based evaluation of ADB's
Country Assistance Program Evaluation
(CAPE). The CAPE concluded that ADB's
performance in the transport and energy
sectors, which account for 65 percent of ADB's
PRC portfolio, was good. Performance in the
agriculture, finance, and industry sectors—
which together account for 21 percent of the
PRC portfolio—was mixed. The CAPE recommended (i) more operational country strategy and more strategic country assistance
plans; (ii) better targeted and more manageable
technical assistance program; (iii) high-level
dialogue between ADB and the PRC to better
support finance sector and enterprise
reforms; (iv) safety net projects as poverty
projects; and (v) environment interventions
focusing more on green issues. These issues
were discussed in detail with the Government
on several occasions. As a result of the CAPE's
findings, the technical assistance program
was streamlined and better targeted.
Governance, and law and policy reform are
being promoted as a cluster of technical
assistance activities. Linkages and implementation arrangements with the Global
Environment Facility are being developed to
address green issues. High-level policy
dialogue identified ADB's desire to play a more
strategic role in the areas of finance, enterprise, and social security reforms.

 

Southeast Asia

The strength and speed of recovery in 1999 in
the Southeast Asian economies have exceeded
expectations. The recovery built up after an
initially tenuous start in the first quarter. All the
countries in the subregion registered positive
growth, yielding a GDP growth rate for the
subregion of 3.3 percent for 1999. This is in
sharp contrast with the contraction of 7.5 percent in 1998. The recovery in the crisis-affected
economies has been based on an expansion in
external demand, especially for semiconductors
and Y2K-related electronic and computer products. The relative improvement in commodity
prices and strengthening of domestic demand
as a result of reflationary monetary and fiscal
policies, a buildup in inventories, a surge in
intraregional trade, and rallies in the industry
and agriculture sectors, also contributed to the
recovery.

However, domestic consumption and, to a
greater extent, investment levels in these economies have remained below precrisis levels. This
reflects the continuation of weak trends in
domestic demand, which are a direct result of
the financial crisis. The unemployment levels
also remain higher than in the precrisis period
and the fall in living standards that happened
as aresult of the crisis has not yet been restored.
The number of people living below the poverty
line has not declined significantly. Concerted
efforts must be made to ensure that the ensuing recovery also benefits the poor and that
future economic growth is broad-based and
does not result in worsening equity levels in
these countries. A strong commitment to continuing with the needed structural reforms,
particularly in the finance and corporate sectors, and to improving the social safety net is,
therefore, necessary to sustain the recovery.

Inflation rates fell sharply to 7.0 percent in
1999 from 20.9 percent in 1998. Improved climatic conditions across the region ensured a
good agriculture performance in most countries
of the subregion. This brought down food
prices, with the most dramatic decline taking
place in Indonesia where inflation dropped from
58.4 percent in 1998 to 20.5 percent in 1999.

expectations of continued political stability, and
higher inflows of capital in the second half of
the year also contributed to the stable inflationary situation in the subregion.

The external balance for the subregion has
improved significantly, with the foreign
exchange reserves rising from around $92 billion at the end of 1998 to about $108 billion at
the end of 1999. This was due to the sharp contraction in imports of the crisis-affected economies in 1998. Foreign capital inflows have
resumed as a result of the improved macroeconomic situation, prospects for a stable
political situation, and progress in structural
reforms. These inflows have, to some extent,
offset the weak trends in domestic capital formation. With the recovery taking hold in 1999,
imports are outstripping exports in most of
the Southeast Asian economies, resulting in
a lowering of the current account surpluses
that were achieved in 1998.

Cambodia

Economic performance

Economic growth: The growth of 5 percent in
1999 real GDP resulted from a good wet season
harvest, continued strength in garment exports,
and a recovery in tourism. After two years of
contraction, the agriculture sector achieved

positive growth in 1999, based on increased
outputs in crops, livestock, and fisheries. Strong
growth in manufacturing and a rebound in construction activity contributed to double-digit
growth in the industry sector. Output in textiles
and clothing apparel, the dominant manufacturing subsector, expanded significantly.
Moderate growth in the services subsector
was partly because of a 33 percent increase
in tourist arrivals in the first eight months of
1999 over the same period in 1998. However,
investment declined in 1999 because the
resumption of foreign aid activities was slow
and because US quotas on textile imports
from Cambodia reduced the pace of the
garment industry's expansion.

Inflation: Average annual inflation fell to
4.0 percent in 1999, compared with 14.8 percent in 1998. The riel, which depreciated by
21.4 percent in 1997 and 8.5 percent in 1998,
recovered in 1999, appreciating by a minimal
0.1 percent. Liquidity increased by 17.3 percent
in 1999 as foreign currency deposits rose by
31.8 percent. However, currency in circulation
shrank by nearly 4.0 percent.

External sector: Exports of timber, fish
products, rubber, and particularly garments led
to strong domestic exports growth of 21.8 percent in 1999. However, with similarly strong
retained imports growth of 20.4 percent, the
trade deficit widened from 6.8 percent of GDP
in 1998 to 7.3 percent in 1999. The currentRegional and Country Highlights

91

 

account deficit also increased to 8.4 percent
of GDP in 1999 from 8.0 percent in 1998.
However, with higher official loans and FDI
disbursements in 1999 combined with larger
transfers, a surplus was registered in the
overall balance of payments, thereby increasing reserves to $28 million from $17 million
in 1998.

Domestic policies: With greater political
stability, the Government has been able to focus
on marshaling political support for the reform
effort. The Government made some progress on
an impressive reform agenda. Revenue collections improved significantly with the introduction of the VAT and with the Government
recognizing the need to improve public expenditure management to redirect spending toward
the economic and social sectors. Monetary
policy has remained conservative, keeping the
exchange rate relatively stable and inflation low.
However, supervision of the banking industry
was still very weak. The Government will require
external technical assistance for improvements
in this area. The Government lowered tariff rates
this year but is taking steps to tighten the
investment regime, which is widely regarded as
overly favorable to investors.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB’s 1995 country
operational strategy in Cambodia focused on
poverty reduction by (i) building capacity for
good governance and project management
through an integrated program of technical
assistance and sector program lending activities, (ii) developing human resources, (iii) promoting economic growth as the principal means
of creating employment and reducing poverty,
and (iv) encouraging natural resource
conservation and environmental protection. The
draft 2000 country operational strategy proposes to facilitate poverty reduction through
investments that (i) promote pro-poor growth
in the rural areas, where most of the poor are
located; (ii) enhance human and social
development to ensure equitable access to the
benefits of economic growth; and (iii) enable
private sector participation in the development of Cambodia.

Policy dialogue: In light of Cambodia's level
of development and transition to a market
economy, it was essential for ADB to promote
and continue dialogue with the Government on
macroeconomic management and the need for
good governance and poverty reduction. ADB
also continued discussing policy reforms in
agriculture, irrigation, and forestry, and the
provision of funds for operating and maintaining
hysical infrastructure. ADB continued to assist
in strengthening good governance practices in
Cambodia in areas such as auditing, public
rocurement, and national account statistics.

Loans and technical assistance: Two loan
rojects were approved in 1999: Primary Roads
Restoration ($68 million) and Provincial Towns
mprovement ($20 million). Both projects will
lay a key role in promoting growth over large
areas of the country and in reducing poverty.
Fourteen technical assistance grants were
approved for $7.5 million; two were for project
preparation and 12 were for capacity building. Cambodia did not receive any loans from
971 to 1991.

Project implementation: Since ADB reesablished lending in 1992, Cambodia has
received 13 loans, of which 11 were still active
at the end of 1999. Contracts amounting to
17.0 million were awarded, bringing the
cumulative total to $173.7 million. The contract
award ratio for 1999 was 9.6 percent. Disbursements in 1999 totaled more than $26.2 million,
with cumulative disbursements totaling
$152.2 million. The disbursement ratio for 1999
was 17.2 percent in contrast to the 1998 ratio
of 21.5 percent.

The Government and ADB implemented
several measures to improve overall portfolio
performance. These included (i) preparing
clearer consultant evaluation criteria;
(ii) adhering to the Government's and ADB's
domestic consultant recruitment procedures to
ensure efficiency and transparency; (iii) ensuring the timely renewal of domestic consultant
contracts to maintain continuity of project
implementation, (iv) providing training seminars
and hands-on training in project accounting to
government staff concerned; (v) delegating
contract awards and disbursement approval
authority to the director/deputy director in theANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

 

Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF);
(vi) increasing the ceiling of advance accounts

MEF; (vii) engaging a private firm to audit
project accounts and financial statements of all
ADB-assisted projects, excluding projects managed by autonomous agencies; and (viii) implementing a small-scale technical assistance on
improving project implementation in Cambodia.

These actions have enabled the

Government to eliminate many systemic issues
hampering efficient project implementation.
However, some lingering issues need to be
addressed to enhance portfolio performance.

Although the streamlining measures have been
adopted in the central government agencies to
expedite processing of contract award documents and disbursement requests, further
delegation of approval authority in line
ministries would facilitate more efficient project
implementation. The transfer of knowledge
from international consultants to counterpart
staff under loan projects has not been effective, as project supervision consultants focused
more on the projects' physical outputs. Also,
some executing agencies could not assign
qualified counterpart staff to work with consultants. More efficient communications
among ADB, executing agencies, and project
supervision consultants would greatly
enhance portfolio performance.

Indonesia

Economic performance

Economic growth: The crisis in Indonesia has
bottomed out, and signs of recovery are appearing after nearly two years of financial and economic turmoil. GDP recorded a 0.2 percent
growth rate in 1999 against the 13.2 percent
contraction in 1998. Sound macroeconomic
policies and the structural reform program have
helped to stabilize the economy and initiate the
recovery. Economic indicators showed a rise
in activity in several sectors, although the
recovery was initially sparked by a rebound in
agriculture. Government consumption and
nonmanufactured exports have provided the
demand stimulus for growth.

Inflation: Inflation declined sharply in
1999. Prices have increased marginally since
October after having declined successively for
the previous seven months. Falling food
prices contributed the most to the drop in
inflation. The appreciation of the rupiah
(Rp)—which was trading at Rp7,200 to the US
dollar toward the end of 1999, as compared
with Rp9,000/dollar at the beginning of
1999—also eased inflationary pressures.
Tight monetary policy likewise kept prices
in check. Average inflation declined from
58.4 percent in 1998 to 20.5 percent in 1999.Regional and Country Highlights

93

 

External sector: The current account continued to show a sizable surplus and reached
3.5 percent of GDP in 1999. The surplus was
mainly because of low imports and near
doubling of world oil prices in 1999. While natural resource-based exports increased significantly in the first half of 1999, seasonally
adjusted manufactured exports remained sluggish. Export performance will depend on
continued recovery in Japan and further
improvement in the region's economies. Meanwhile, private capital inflows have risen, helping gross foreign reserves to reach an estimated
$27 billion at the end of the year, equivalent to
more than six months of imports.

Domestic policies: The political transition
that began in 1998 was completed with the
election of the President and Vice-President in
October. The new Government declared that
implementing economic reforms will be one of
its key priorities. Formation of the new
Government and its affirmation to implement
economic reforms had a positive impact on
investor confidence. Consequently, foreign capital reflows, the Jakarta stock market, and the
exchange rate rebounded in the second half of
1999. However, the uncertainty during the
parliamentary elections in June, the formation
of the new Government in October, and the
Bank Bali affair adversely affected investor
confidence and donor activities.

In 1999, the Government stepped up the
work of restructuring the banking and
corporate subsectors. The Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency (IBRA) launched the bank
recapitalization program, resulting in the closure of 66 banks and the takeover by the State
of 12 banks. Of these, seven private banks were
jointly recapitalized by their owners and the
Government, with the latter injecting 80 percent of the required capital. IBRA, which owns
almost 80 percent of the banking industry
assets, is faced with the greater challenge of
(i) completing the restructuring of state banks
and preparing them for eventual privatization,
(ii) ensuring that all banks observe the new prudential guidelines, and (iii) divesting the assets
it acquired in an expeditious and transparent
manner. In line with the economic reforms and
the recovery program, the Government also

embarked on reforming public administration
with a focus on decentralization. Two laws were
passed during the year, which will significantly
change the relationship between the central
and local governments. The Law on Local
Government Administration provides for a twoyear phased devolution of many government
functions to the local governments up to the
district level. The Law on Central-Local Fiscal
Balance, on the other hand, alters the structure of local government financing by providing financial resources that are consistent with
the devolution of responsibilities to local governments while maintaining the balance
between the often conflicting objectives of
national equity and local autonomy.
Anticorruption efforts were likewise vigorously pursued in 1999. The Government revoked
the special privileges granted to various interest groups and mounted an anticorruption
campaign to investigate and reveal incidences
of corruption, collusion, and nepotism in
government agencies. The Government also
gan to address weaknesses in public procurement and project implementation. A new
residential decree on improved procurement
rocedures was drafted to facilitate and improve
he implementation of public investment
rojects. The Government published an anticorruption strategy that calls for administrative
and judicial reforms to combat corruption.
Parliament passed two new laws on clean
government and eradication of criminal acts of
corruption. The Clean Government Law requires
public officials to declare their assets prior to
assuming their posts and to agree to having
heir assets open to official audit during and/
or after their terms. The Criminal Acts Law
defines the corrupt practices of criminal nature
hat are harmful to the finances and/or the
economy of the State and establishes the basis
or legal prosecution and criminal charges. The
Criminal Acts Law also provides for public
articipation in legal surveillance and in estabishing an independent anticorruption agency
and/or commission for legal enforcement.

A decline in inflation and appreciation of
he rupiah allowed the monetary authorities
o relax the tight monetary stance. As a result,
interest rates fell from a high of 70 percentANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

 

in August 1998 to 12.5 percent at the end of
1999. Despite this, monetary policy will remain
cautious to maintain price and exchange
rate stability.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's operations during
the year continued to be guided by the interim
strategy that emphasizes policy and institutional
reforms in key economic sectors, support for
the implementation of the decentralization
agenda, and strengthened measures for poverty reduction and social protection. ADB
operations focused on protecting women's
health and access to education and income.

Under the Social Protection Sector
Development Program (SPSDP) approved in
1998 and the Health and Nutrition Sector
Development Program (HNSDP) approved in
1999, support was provided to maintain health
and family planning, promote safe motherhood
activities, and provide nutrition support to
pregnant and lactating women. Through its
scholarship program, the SPSDP ensures the
access of female students to schools. The
Community and Local Government Support Sector Development Program approved in 1999
supports women's needs for income-generating
activities under social safety net programs. ADB
closely coordinated with IMF, World Bank, and
other financial institutions in pursuing the
interim strategic agenda. In 1999 ADB emphasized managing the existing loan portfolio in
Indonesia to ensure its continuing relevance in
the current situation.

With early signs of recovery, ADB is
developing a new country operational strategy
that will guide its medium-term operations in
Indonesia. In support of the 2000 country
operational strategy, a paper on gender issues
was prepared, which describes areas for assistance and policy dialogue that promote
mainstreaming gender in ADB operations in
Indonesia. Major strategic concerns in
Indonesia include poverty reduction, governance, decentralization, return to sustainable
growth, and social development. The new strategy will address these concerns through a

combined program of assistance, comprising
policy reforms and priority investment.

Policy dialogue: ADB's policy dialogue with
the Government focused on implementing
strategies for economic reforms and measures
for social protection in the aftermath of the
crisis. In the finance sector, ADB deepened
policy discussions with the Government on a
substantial reform agenda through the Financial
Governance Reforms: Sector Development
Program Loan, which was approved in 1998
and being implemented in 1999. The Extended
Mission to Indonesia has provided day-to-day
advice to the Government on program implementation in banking subsector restructuring, capital market development, and public
financial management.

In the social sectors, ADB broadened policy
dialogue with the Government on effective
public spending to provide for essential social
services and to mitigate the adverse impact of
the crisis. The policy discussions facilitated the
implementation of the SPSDP and HNSDP. ADB
accelerated policy discussions on the
administrative and fiscal decentralization
agenda and on the involvement of the local
community and civil society in development
planning and implementation. The policy
dialogue resulted in the formulation of the
policy-based Community and Local Government
Support Sector Development Program.Regional and Country Highlights

Real sector reforms were an integral
component of ADB's policy dialogue with the
Government. ADB helped the Government in
the policy-based Power Sector Restructuring
Program, which involves dismantling the
vertical monopoly to increase private sector
participation in moving toward competitive
markets for power generation and distribution, and to improve cost recovery. ADB has
worked closely with the Government to
develop and implement policy reform agenda
in other sectors, including corporate governance of state enterprises, trade and industry,
and small and medium enterprises. During the
year, ADB actively pursued policy dialogue on
governance and anticorruption. ADB has
adopted an Anticorruption Action Plan for
Indonesia, which was discussed at a highlevel meeting with the Government, and in an
open forum with Indonesian civil society groups
and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) in
July 1999. The Action Plan addresses specific
governance and anticorruption initiatives and
policy and institutional reforms.

Loans and technical assistance: Six loans
for three projects/programs, totaling $1.0 billion, were approved during the year. All the
loans were financed from ADB's ordinary capital
resources, with two for the energy sector
($400 million), two for the social sector

($300 million), and two for multisector
($320 million). ADB also approved 19 technical
assistance grants totaling $11.3 million. Of
these, three were for preparing new projects.
In December 1999, ADB also approved a modest
assistance ($6 million) for providing clean water
in West Timor, in response to the East Timor
crisis, by reallocating funds from an existing
Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan.

Project implementation: Since becoming a
member of ADB in 1966, Indonesia has received
247 loans, of which 167 were closed and 80 were
still active at the end of 1999. Contracts worth
$1.3 billion were awarded during the year,
bringing the cumulative total to $10 billion. The
contract award ratio for 1999 was 30.5 percent.
Disbursements amounted to $1.3 billion, with
cumulative disbursements reaching $10.6 billion. The disbursement ratio for 1999 was
24.8 percent.

The first tranches for three program loans
approved in 1999 were released, and the second tranche for another program loan approved
in 1998 was disbursed. The contract award and
disbursement performance for project loans
were adversely affected by the continuing shortage of counterpart funding. The Indonesia
Resident Mission continued to play a lead role
in project administration, particularly in following up the submission of audited financial
statements. Following the comprehensive
portfolio review undertaken in 1998, another
portfolio restructuring exercise was carried out
in 1999 in partnership with the Government,
which covered 24 slow-moving and poorperforming projects. Agreement was reached on
the cancellation of all uncommitted loan balances of about $121 million under two ongoing projects and in the identification of potential
savings for about $367 million under 19 other
projects. Including the cancellations of projects
not covered by the restructuring exercise, total
actual cancellations in 1999 amounted to
$389.8 million. Through the portfolio review,
ADB adopted a systematic approach to sector
portfolio management that would foster greater
synergy in implementation. ADB and the World
Bank started discussions to prepare for the next
joint country portfolio performance review,
which will be conducted in early 2000.ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

 

Lao People's Democratic
Republic

Economic performance

Economic growth: The Lao PDR achieved
4.0 percent growth in 1999. Agriculture, which
accounted for about half of GDP, registered
accelerated growth, offsetting a slowdown in
the industry and services sectors. Agricultural
production benefited from an expansion of
irrigated area under cultivation, a government
policy promoting agricultural exports,
favorable cross-border trading opportunities,
and improved weather conditions. Growth
inthe industry sector—dominated by
manufacturing—slowed because of moderate
growth in manufacturing and a continued
slump in construction despite huge gains in
the relatively small electricity, gas, and water
subsectors. Growth in aggregate services
decelerated, with banking, insurance, and real
estate still on the decline.

Inflation: Despite a rapid expansion of
liquidity in the second quarter of 1999
(70.7 percent), tightened monetary policy in
the second half of the year reduced liquidity
growth from 113.3 percent in 1998 to
86.3 percent through November 1999. As a
result, year-end inflation decreased from
142.0 percent in 1998 to 86.7 percent in 1999.
However, the improvement was accompanied
by substantial volatility in the kip (KN)—which
fell to nearly KN10,000 per US dollar in the
parallel market in August 1999 before climbing
back to KN7,686 per US dollar in December
1999. This resulted in the further depreciation
of the kip by 40 percent from December 1998
to December 1999.

External sector: Preliminary staff estimates
indicate an overall balance-of-payments surplus
in 1999. This is due to improvements in the trade
balance (a 3.0 percent increase in exports combined with a 3.0 percent decrease in imports)
and FDI and official development assistance
(ODA) disbursements. Official foreign exchange
reserves increased from $113 million
(2.1 months of imports) at the end of 1998 to
$132 million (3.7 months of imports) at the end
of 1999. Debt service was at $56.0 million in

1999, equivalent to 11.6 percent of exports of
goods and nonfactor services.

Domestic policies: Over the past several
years, macroeconomic management has been
inadequate. It has been characterized by
expansionary fiscal policy, resulting in large
fiscal deficits, accommodated by an inflationary monetary policy. Consequently, hyperinflation and substantial depreciation of the kip
prevailed throughout the period. The Government has been slow to reduce liquidity
because of a reluctance to finance the cost
of issuing high interest rate bonds. In addition,
interest and exchange rates are determined
administratively. The unstable macroeconomic environment further weakened the
banking system, which has suffered from
excessive nonperforming loans, insolvency
problems, and slow progress in banking reform.
Trade policy has become more liberal recently,
with the increased number of licensed trading
companies compared with the previous year.
Finally, although the foreign investment regime
appears liberal on the surface, the prospective
investor faced complex procedures in obtaining
licenses, permits, and approvals, which must
be periodically renewed.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: Since the beginning of
operations in the Lao PDR in 1970 (the New
Economic Mechanism was introduced in 1986),
ADB assistance has focused primarily on the
energy and transport sectors. It was then
diversified to support the economic transition
to a market-oriented economy and extended to
such sectors as agriculture, water supply,
health, education, and finance. Future ADB
assistance will target poverty reduction through
basic education, primary health services, power
transmission, and rural infrastructure, particularly through rural roads, irrigation, small towns
development, and agriculture. Lending and
technical assistance programs beginning in
2000 will increasingly focus on efforts to reduce poverty. The program of activities will
include direct poverty intervention projects and
continue to promote economic growth projects
that have high impact on reducing poverty.Regional and Country Highlights

97

 

While the sector focus will depend on the
country's needs and priorities, efforts will be
made to maximize poverty reduction components in all project designs.

Policy dialogue: In 1999, significan
achievements were made in policy suppor
and coordination, culminating in severa
activities and agreements. ADB participated
extensively in the Article IV Mission with IMF
and the World Bank and undertook join
missions with the World Bank in formulating
a Financial Sector Strategy for the Lao PDR.
The Government will host a high-level seminar
to discuss key issues on the economic and
finance sectors. ADB also agreed to undertake
a joint poverty assessment with the Worl
Bank, leading to a Roundtable Meeting in
Vientiane in November 2000 that has fighting
poverty as its theme. The Government used
several ADB-financed sector strategies in
facilitating this process, including those on
primary health care, agriculture, education
development, and rural infrastructure.
Technical assistance to help the Government
formulate the public investment plan was also
provided. Policy support was given through
a technical assistance for strengthening the
capacity of aid coordination and monitoring,
which will link external funding assistance
with the public investment plan and the
budget process.

Loans and technical assistance: Three loans
were approved for 1999: the $32 million loan
component of the Greater Mekong Subregion
East-West Corridor, Shifting Cultivation
Stabilization ($5.6 million), and Water Supply
and Sanitation ($20 million) projects. Eleven
technical assistance grants totaling $5.9 million were approved in 1999.

Project implementation: Since becoming a
member in 1966, the Lao PDR has received a
total of 46 loans, of which 29 were closed and
17 were still active at the end of 1999. Contracts
worth $14.0 million were awarded during the
year, bringing the cumulative total contracts to
$617.8 million. The contract award ratio for
1999 was 8.4 percent. Disbursements for the
year totaled $46.8 million, bringing cumulative
disbursements to $564.6 million. The disbursement ratio for 1999 was 19.4 percent.

 

Total disbursements amounted to
$46.8 million or 72 percent of that projected.
ADB's initiatives to improve portfolio
performance include (i) strengthening linkages
between the results of annual country portfolio reviews and the design of country operational strategies and country assistance plans,
and defining appropriate operational procedures for the missions; (ii) drawing on information relevant to portfolio management to
decide on objectives, alternatives, potential
risks, and ways to improve the sectors;
(iii) developing portfolio performance indicators
and introducing time-bound portfolio

portfolio meets mutual development objectives;
(iv) requesting project management unit
(PMU) managers to set and enforce high standards for their performance and quality
administration; and (v) encouraging line
ministries to take a more active part in
portfolio management initiatives.

Overall portfolio performance of ongoing
ADB projects in the Lao PDR was generally
good. Of the 17 ongoing projects, 9 were
classified as satisfactory for implementation
progress, 5 as partially satisfactory, and 2 as
highly satisfactory. In terms of development
objectives, 14 were classified as satisfactory and
2 as highly satisfactory.

In the past year, the Government and ADB
implemented measures to improve portfolio
performance in the Lao PDR. These include
(i) decentralizing project implementation
responsibilities for some projects to the
provincial level; (ii) strengthening PMU staff
capacity in project management; (iii) streamlining internal disbursement procedures for
road projects within the Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction; and
(iv) issuing an interministerial decision to adopt,
as an Official government document, the
project accounting manual prepared under
the ADB-financed regional technical assistance
on capacity building in project accounting. As
a result of these efforts, loan signing/effectiveness and flow of funds improved.

Despite these efforts, however, portfolio
performance needs to be enhanced. While
start-up activities improved, difficulties have
been experienced in staffing PMUs and in
other activities in the latter part of the project
implementation cycle. The Government's
cumbersome disbursement process for
imprest accounts remains a concern. To
expedite project implementation, contract
awards need to be streamlined by removing
unnecessary layers of approval authority.
Compliance with loan covenants, particularly
the timely submission of audited project
accounts and financial statements, also has
to be improved. In many projects, insufficient
institutional capacity continues to hamper
efficient project implementation.

Malaysia

Economic performance

Economic growth: The Malaysian economy
achieved a robust recovery in 1999 with real
GDP expanding by 5.4 percent after contracting by 7.5 percent in 1998. The economic
recovery was underpinned by buoyant export
growth and an increased private consumption.
Private investment, however, continued to
contract due to excess industrial capacity. All
major production sectors, with the exception
of construction and mining, recorded higher
rates of growth in 1999. The manufacturing
subsector expanded by 8.9 percent, with strong
external demand for electronic equipment and
components spearheading the revival. The
agriculture sector expanded by 4.6 percent, supported by a significant increase in crude palm
oil production, although the output of the other
agriculture subsectors declined. The services
subsector recorded a growth of 2.4 percent.
Although a large surplus of high-rise
commercial buildings and higher-end
condominiums continued to depress construction activity, the contraction in this subsector
was moderate in 1999.

Inflation: Consumer price inflation
decreased steadily during the year and averaged
2.8 percent, compared with 5.3 percent in 1998.
The lower inflation rate reflected considerable
excess Capacity, greater exchange rate stability
than in the corresponding period of 1998, and
a slower rate of increase in food prices.

External sector: The balance-of-payments
position strengthened further in 1999, aided by
a large trade surplus. While the trade surplus
in 1998 was driven by import compression, the
trade surplus in 1999 was attributed to rapid
export expansion. Export growth of 10.2 percent was buoyed by stronger regional and
robust US demand for Malaysia's electronic
goods. Additionally, the fixed exchange rate of
the ringgit to the US dollar and the slight
recovery in the values of the other regional currencies in 1999 boosted export growth. Import
growth of 9.9 percent, on the other hand, was
stimulated by renewed consumer confidence
and the need to replenish depleted stocks ofRegional and Country Highlights

99

 

raw materials. Imports of capital goods, however, remained subdued due to excess capacity
in several production sectors. A larger trade surplus in 1999 more than offset the deficit in the
services and transfers account, leading to a
higher current account surplus.

In the capital account, a net outflow of
short-term capital totaled $5.8 billion. Portfolio investment amounting to $1.7 billion was
repatriated between 1 September and
15 October 1999 after the 12-month holding
period for portfolio funds expired on
1 September 1999. The net inflow of long-term
capital increased from $2.2 billion in 1998 to
about $3.0 billion in 1999. The Government
reentered the international bond market with
a $1 billion issue in May 1999 after a gap of
nine years. The new borrowings in 1999 also
included concessional loans from the
Government of Japan under the New Miyazawa
Initiative. The overall balance of payments was
in surplus and the net international reserves of
Bank Negara Malaysia increased from $26.2 billion at the end of 1998 to $30.9 billion or six
months of imports at the end of 1999. The
external debt position remained manageable in
1999. The debt service ratio declined to 6.2 percent from 6.6 percent in 1998. The ratio of shortterm debt to foreign exchange reserves declined
to 23 percent in 1999 from 32 percent in 1998.
A noteworthy development in 1999 was
Malaysia's reentry in three benchmark equity
indexes: the International Finance Corporation
and the Dow Jones Global Indexes (both
effective November 1999) and the Morgan
Stanley Capital Group of Indexes (under review).

Domestic policies: Macroeconomic management focused on aggressively stimulating
domestic demand in support of output growth.
The reflationary measures initiated in mid-1998
were further intensified in 1999. As a result, the
fiscal deficit increased from 1.9 percent of gross
national product (GNP) in 1998 to 4.9 percent
in 1999. The countercyclical budgetary measures benefited the social sectors. Allocations
for the health and education subsectors were
increased in real terms in 1999 compared with
the actual expenditures in 1998. Interest rates
continued to decline, led by a 1.5 percent
reduction in 1999 in Bank Negara's intervention

rate—the rate used by the banks to fix their base
lending rate. As a result, the average base lending rate of commercial banks dropped to below
7 percent. The lending rates could have fallen
further if the market-determined interbank rate
was used as the anchor. Considerations—such
as maintaining a positive real rate of return on
domestic saving and profitability of banks—
constrained monetary policy. Reflecting stronger economic activity, all the monetary
aggregates (M1, M2, and M3) expanded in
1999, although Bank Negara Malaysia moderated the monetary expansion by mopping
up liquidity. The quantitative capital controls
introduced in 1998 were substantially modiied. On 21 September 1999, a uniform capial gains tax of 10 percent replaced the more
stringent earlier restrictions on repatriation
of foreign capital.

Building on policy measures introduced in
998, the Government pursued reforms in the
finance sector, restructuring the corporate secor, and strengthening corporate governance.
Bank Negara Malaysia announced a merger
rogram for the banking system in July 1999,
aimed at consolidating the existing banks and
inancial institutions under six financial
groups. Subsequently following industry
requests, Bank Negara Malaysia allowed the
anks greater flexibility in choosing their own
merger partners. It is anticipated that all
aspects of the merger exercise will be completed by the end of 2000.

 

ADB operations

Operational strategy: The operational strategy
for Malaysia approved in 1997 is no longer relevant as it was formulated before the financial
crisis in mid-1997 and the economic recovery
that began in 1999. The Government and ADB
are discussing the basis on which a revised
assistance program for Malaysia could be
envisaged. Such a program would be expected
to include objectives aimed at addressing ADB's
overarching goal of poverty reduction.

Policy dialogue: New areas of policy dialogue would be expected in line with the
objectives and scope of the assistance program
to which the Government and ADB would agree.ANNUAL REPORT 1999

Myanmar

Economic performance

Economic growth: Following several years of
high growth rates of around 8 percent in the
early 1990s, according to official estimates,
growth slowed from 5.7 percent in FY1997/98
(ending 31 March) to 5.0 percent in FY1998/99.
The slowdown can be attributed to the adverse
impact of unfavorable weather conditions on
agricultural production, the shortage of agricultural inputs such as fertilizer and pesticides
caused by foreign exchange constraints, and the
financial crisis in the region following the
devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997. The
economy's structure has not changed since
market-oriented reforms were introduced in
1988. Myanmar remains a largely agrarian
economy, with agriculture accounting for
43 percent of GDP and more than 60 percent
of employment. Official data indicate the
unemployment rate was 7 percent in
FY1997/98, part of a steady increase over the
past four years.

Inflation: Inflation soared in recent years,
including 30-40 percent in FY1997/98 and
40 percent in FY1998/99, largely as a result of
increasing food prices and excess liquidity
caused by financing government deficits
through Central Bank credit. The CPI in Yangon
increased from 20 percent in FY1996/97 to
34 percent in FY1997/98, and to 49 percent in
FY1998/99.

External sector: Trade was heavily controlled by quantitative restrictions on imports
and exports and foreign exchange controls.
Weak export performance continued to substantially widen the current account deficit and put
pressure on the balance of payments. Total
exports amounted to only $1.3 billion in
FY1998/99, mostly consisting of primary products. Border trade with neighboring countries
accounted for nearly 30 percent of total exports.
Total imports amounted to $2.6 billion, of whichRegional and Country Highlights

 

50 percent were capital goods. Foreign
exchange reserves were reported to be about
$400 million, or 1.8 months of imports. At the
end of March 1998, the total outstanding debt
of Myanmar was $5.6 billion, of which about
90 percent was medium- and long-term debt.
At the time, Myanmar had arrears totaling
about $1.6 billion, of which 70 percent were
owed to bilateral sources, 28 percent to private
creditors, and the rest to multilateral sources.
By the end of March 1999, arrears with
multilateral sources are believed to have more
than tripled.

Domestic policies: The Government
continues to heavily control Myanmar's
economy. In April 1999, the Central Bank
reduced its interest/discount rate from 15 percent to 12 percent, effectively reducing the
commercial banks! profit margin further in an
environment of high inflation and already
negative real interest rates. Exchange rate
distortions continue to favor a few importing
industries at the expense of consumers. While
the fiscal deficit has been reduced, this is
mainly attributable to reduced public spending,
particularly of social spending, to unsustainably low levels. At the same time,
financing the fiscal deficit through Central
Bank credit is one underlying factor of
persistent high inflation.

have been provided to Myanmar since 1986 and
no technical assistance grants since 1987.

Project implementation: All 32 loans, which
were approved before 1986, were closed by the
end of 1998. However, Myanmar is involved in
the Program of Economic Cooperation in the
Greater Mekong Subregion. In that capacity,
Myanmar participates in regional meetings and
workshops supported by ADB's regional technical assistance. To keep ADB's institutional
knowledge of socioeconomic developments
up-to-date, ADB has continued to review
developments in economic policies and programs to the extent possible using the limited
data available.

Philippines
Economic performance

Economic growth: The impact on the Philippine
economy of the El Niho phenomenon, which
heavily influenced the economic downturn in
1998, dissipated in 1999. The effects of the
Asian financial crisis, however, were still
evident, particularly on the industry sector
and investments. Overall, the economy was
recovering in 1999. While GDP growth in 1998
was marginally negative, a GDP growth of
3.2 percent was achieved in 1999. The recovery was mainly supported by an output lift in
the agriculture sector, which experienced a
growth of 6.6 percent after the El Nifo drought
of 1997 and 1998. The services subsector, which
had remained resilient throughout the crisis,
expanded by 3.9 percent, based mainly on the
growth of retail trade supported by steady
growth in basic consumer goods. The industry
sector's performance continued to be sluggish,
with only a 0.5 percent growth in 1999 as a
result of the lingering effects of depressed
domestic demand.ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

 

Inflation: Inflation rates improved considerably, and averaged 6.6 percent in 1999 from
9.7 percent in 1998. Better agriculture sector
performance and weak aggregate demand contributed to this outcome.

External sector: The balance-of-payments
situation eased considerably in the first
10 months of 1999, as the trade environment
improved and as the authorities took steps to
bolster the balance of payments through officially arranged debt. The momentum of export
growth, which had been robust throughout the
crisis, continued in 1999. With imports slowing as aresult of weak domestic demand, a trade
surplus emerged; and with the rise in remittances, a significant current account surplus of
$5.6 billion resulted in the first 10 months of
1999, nearly tenfold that in 1998. The
Government's active intervention through official borrowings and bond flotations in the international capital markets helped support the
capital account. As a result of surpluses in both
current and capital accounts, gross international reserves rose to nearly $15 billion by
December 1999. The sharp rise in the external debt
to GNP ratio from 53 percent in 1997 to 65 percent as of September 1999 was the result of the
peso depreciation and is cause for some concern.

However, this external debt should remain
manageable with robust export growth, the
favorable debt maturity structure, and the large
share of concessional debt.

Domestic policies: The recovery process
could be affected by the lack of progress on key
reforms that were initiated by the Government
at the onset of the crisis. Delays in completing
the reforms are beginning to be a major source
of concern for investors.

Several initiatives were begun, for example,
on the taxation front. But tax administration
has only been marginally improved and the
drafting of legislation for tax rationalization was
completed only recently. On expenditure management, several reforms were planned, including reengineering of the bureaucracy. However,
structural weaknesses—such as high expenditure on wages and interest, low capital expenditures, inadequate spending on social services,
and continued duplication of functions by
national government agencies in areas devolved

to local governments—remain. Poor functioning of government corporations continued to
contribute to large public sector deficits. While
preparatory work on privatizing the National
Power Corporation has begun, legislation—
which is key to the process—has yet to be
passed. Pursuing the privatization of other
government corporations is also necessary.

Quicker action to implement the program
of reforms in the finance sector and capital
markets is needed to assuage investor concerns.
On the banking side, progress has been made
on several fronts although reform is still
incomplete in crucial areas. Apart from pending legislation, current bank secrecy laws
prevent full information from being made available to supervisors, making monitoring and
supervision difficult. More reform is needed in
the areas of prudential standards, disclosure,
supervision, and bank exits and resolution. As
for capital markets, delay in the passage of the
vital Revised Securities Act has postponed much
needed reforms in the stock market.

The Government has recently released the
new Medium-Term Philippine Development
Plan 1999-2004, which addresses medium-term
development initiatives to correct the structural
constraints facing the economy. The plan
envisages a recovery of growth and poverty
being reduced from 32 percent in 1997 to
25-28 percent in 2004.

A particular initiative of the plan is to
establish a process of monitoring poverty incidence annually. The drop in poverty incidence
from 36 percent in 1994 to 32 percent in 1997
was relatively substantial. However, poverty
incidence continues at unacceptably high levels, particularly in rural areas. Evidence suggests that the financial crisis increased the ranks
of the poor in 1998. Aggregate employment
improved in 1999 but the unemployment rate
fell only marginally and remains higher than
precrisis levels. Increases in the labor force
dampened the improvement in the unemployment rate and pushed underemployment
higher. Despite a recovery of agriculture sector production in 1999, no marked improvement in poverty incidence on the 1997 level
is expected. The Government faces a difficult
task in reducing poverty.Regional and Country Highlights

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's operational strategy for the Philippines was reformulated in April
1998. The strategy takes into account the
operational priorities arising from the Asian
financial crisis and gives increased emphasis
to poverty reduction and social development.
The strategy particularly emphasizes (i) promoting equitable growth; (ii) improving the provision of basic social services, including health
and education; and (iii) improving management
and protection of the environment. The strategy
conforms with the Government's medium-term
development plan. In consultation with the
Government, a sharper focus on poverty reducion began in 1999 after ADB adopted its poverty reduction strategy. Although the Philippine
operational strategy cites poverty reduction as
its major focus, a partnership agreement with
he Government is a new initiative under the
poverty reduction strategy and is expected to
be finalized in mid-2000; it will provide further
impetus on both sides to implement projects
addressing poverty.

Policy dialogue: In 1999, ADB continued its
policy dialogue in the sectors where it has
ongoing program loans. These include the
energy sector, particularly regarding the
erformance and financial health of the National
Power Corporation and the restructuring of
he electricity subsector; the environment
subsector for air quality; and the capital
market subsector. In the context of processing two new sector development program
loans, ADB also entered into intensive policy
dialogue on grains, including restructuring the
National Food Authority through the Grains
Sector Development Program, and on the urban
environment through the Pasig River Environmental Management and Rehabilitation Sector
Development Program.

Another major focus of the policy dialogue
with the Government in 1999 was on improving
the implementation performance of the
country's existing portfolio. ADB and the
Government undertook three portfolio reviews
during the year, including one review jointly undertaken with the Japan Bank for International
Cooperation and the World Bank. Through these

 

exercises, ADB and the Government identified
project preparedness (including land acquisition), better project implementation, and the
need for a better oversight structure as major
urgent issues. A time-bound action plan was
agreed upon with the Government for remedial
measures. Special technical assistance is being
provided or programmed by ADB to help the
Government strengthen its capacity, particularly in the areas of procurement, local government planning and financing, and project
monitoring and auditing.

Loans and technical assistance: Ten technical assistance grants of $7.3 million were
approved during the year. Further to 1998's
record lending volume of $855.4 million to the
Philippines, ADB approved one technical assistance loan in 1999 amounting to $3.0 million
for a private infrastructure project development
facility and processed two other sector development program loans for a total of $350 million. ADB also approved two loans amounting
to $85 million in its private sector operations
for the Philippines, reflecting the strategy to
mobilize private sector resources for the
country's development.

Project implementation: Since becoming a
member in 1966, the Philippines has received
a total of 175 loans, of which 121 were closed
and 54 were still active at the end of 1999.
Contract awards in 1999 totaled $78.9 million,
bringing the cumulative total to $4.4 billion. The
contract award ratio for 1999 was 5.5 percent.
Total disbursements for the year amounted to
$127.5 million and cumulative disbursements
reached $4.7 billion. The disbursement ratio for
1999 was 6.8 percent.

Although efforts were made to prioritize
counterpart budgets for ADB-assisted projects,
the slow disbursements in the year partly reflect
budget inadequacy. While the Government has
tried to resolve the issues hampering project
implementation in the Philippines, the problems
have not yet been fully resolved. The implementation issues identified during the 1999 Country
Portfolio Review Mission include the
(i) provision of counterpart funds, (ii) procurement procedures, (iii) financial reporting,
(iv) financial and implementation capacity at the
local government level, (v) slow-moving legislation, and (vi) municipal development fund.
Loan savings of $126.7 million were canceled
during the year.

Thailand

Economic performance

Economic growth: After an unprecedented real
GDP contraction of 10.4 percent in 1998, the
economy started showing positive signs of

recovery in the beginning of 1999. Real GDP
growth in 1999 is estimated to be 4.0 percent,
supported by increased consumption and higher
capacity utilization in the manufacturing
subsector and encouraged by several government stimulus packages. The manufacturing
production index increased by 12.6 percent
from January to December 1999, prompting
the capacity utilization rate to increase to
63 percent from just over 50 percent in 1998.
However, this is still below the normal levels
of 70-80 percent. Domestic demand, which
had contracted sharply in the previous year,
rose by 8.5 percent in 1999. Only the private
investment index continued its decline
throughout 1999, although at a much slower
pace, reaching zero growth in December 1999,
compared with a 40 percent decline in 1998.
The economic crisis since mid-1997 resulted
in historically high unemployment. In 1999,
unemployment, including the seasonally
inactive labor force, reached 1.9 million persons, 5.9 percent of the total labor force.
Underemployment also increased significantly. Even though transitory employment
has been boosted through public programs,
unemployment remains well above precrisis
levels, thereby restraining the economy's
revitalization.

Inflation: Following a year of relatively high
inflation of 8.1 percent in 1998, it was contained
at 0.3 percent in 1999 largely because of lower
prices for food and agricultural commodities.

External sector: Performance of the external sector improved significantly in 1999. Export
earnings in US dollar terms increased by 7.4 percent, while imports grew at a higher rate of
17.7 percent. The current account balance
remained in surplus at $11.2 billion. Despite
increased FDI inflows, the net capital
movements registered a deficit of $8.2 billion,
reflecting large private capital outflows as commercial banks continued to repay their external debts. Consequently, external debt stood at
$75.6 billion at the end of 1999, down from
$86.2 billion at the end of 1998; the share of
short-term debt also declined from 27 to 19 percent during the same period. However, public
sector debt as a proportion of total external debt
has more than doubled since the crisis beganRegional and Country Highlights

105

 

in July 1997 and now accounts for 46 percent
of total debt. Official international reserves
increased to $34.8 billion or 8.7 months of
imports in December 1999. The exchange rate
was fairly stable at baht (B)37-39 to the US dollar for the whole year.

Domestic policies: In FY1998/99 (ending
30 September), the Government maintained its
expansionary fiscal stance adopted in 1998 after
the fiscal and monetary targets of the
adjustment program of 1997 proved to be too
contractionary. The Government continued to
relax its public sector deficit target; under the
eighth Letter of Intent to IMF in September
1999, the consolidated deficit, including the cost
of financial restructuring, was projected at
7.2 percent of GDP for FY1999 (1.7 percent for
financial restructuring), compared with 5.5 percent in 1998. In 1999, the Government launched
two economic stimulus packages with expenditures of B53 billion in March and B100 billion in August, along with tax and tariff
reductions. While the March package was aimed
at increasing employment and stimulating private consumption, the August package focused
on tax and tariff measures, equity investment
funds, measures to improve the recovery of the
real estate sector, and financing for small and
medium enterprises (SMEs). Despite an easing
of monetary policy, the growth rate of money
supply continued to slow in 1999. At the end
of 1999, the increase in M2 was 2.3 percent,
compared with 9.5 percent at the end of 1998.
Interest rates declined, with the interbank rate
at 1.2 percent, prime (minimum lending) rate
at 8.25-8.50 percent, and deposit rate at 4.004.25 percent. However, the credit crunch continued in 1999 because of the local banks'
concern with high levels of nonperforming loans
and tightened loan-loss provisioning requirements. Nonperforming loans, though declining
from a peak of 47.7 percent of all finance sector loans outstanding in May 1999, continued
to be high at 38.5 percent in December 1999.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: In response to the crisis
in 1997, ADB immediately changed its strategy
and introduced fast-disbursing program loans

focusing on the finance, social, rural, and
agriculture sectors to contain the adverse
impact of the crisis. The 1999 interim strategy
for Thailand provides the strategic framework
for ADB operations against the background of
the crisis and aims at assisting the country's
recovery and future growth by addressing three
key objectives: (i) reducing poverty and
improving the quality of life, (ii) structural
reforms of the finance sector, and (iii) restoring competitiveness to promote efficient,
regionally balanced, and sustainable growth.
The strategy gives priority to interventions in
the finance, social, and agriculture/rural development sectors. All projects except those
involving national systems are to be concentrated in the north, northeast, and southern
regions of the country, which are relatively less
developed and account for the majority of
Thailand's population, including most of the
target groups below the poverty line. The geographic focus is intended to address growing
regional disparities and maximize the povertyreducing impact of the program. The strategy
also attempts to mainstream crosscutting
concerns, such as reducing poverty, enhancing
he role of women in development, improving
governance, developing the private sector, and
rotecting the environment. It emphasizes both
official and commercial cofinancing to maximize leverage of ADB's assistance to Thailand.

Policy dialogue: The focus of policy diaogue continued to be on longer-term reform
rograms to revive sustainable and equitable
growth, including in the finance, social, educaion, and agriculture sectors. The finance and
social sector reform programs, formulated
immediately after the onset of the crisis, are
already being implemented through the
Financial Markets Reform Program and the
Social Sector Program loans. The latter focuses
on mitigating the short-term adverse impact of
he current crisis on the labor market, social
welfare, education, and health subsectors, and
on addressing longer-term structural weaknesses in these sectors. Poverty reduction and
ealth programs for the poor and other support schemes for the most vulnerable are
combined with longer-term institutional
reforms to create a sustainable social safety netANNUAL REPORT 1999

in Thailand. Both the Higher Education Development Project and the Agriculture Sector
Program loans are aimed at restoring Thailand's
long-term competitiveness and ensuring sustainable growth and development. Agricultural
restructuring to improve productivity, export
competitiveness, and sector management will
increase employment and income, thereby
helping reduce rural poverty.

Loans and technical assistance: Two new
loans and one technical assistance loan totaling $363.8 million were approved in 1999 for
agriculture sector reform ($300 million), higher
education development ($59.3 million), and
restructuring of specialized financial institutions
($4.5 million). Both the agriculture sector loans
and the financial institutions technical assistance loan address necessary reforms and
restructuring of the institutions involved,
while the higher education development
project was extended to enhance Thailand's
competitiveness through increased research
and development in science- and technologyrelated fields. Technical assistance grants
totaling $6.2 million for five projects were
also approved, two of which were linked to
the Agriculture Sector Program loan and one
to the technical assistance loan for specialized financial institutions.

Project implementation: Since the start of
ADB operations in Thailand in 1968, ADB has
approved a total of 83 loans amounting to

Contract awards in 1999 totaled $555.8 million,
bringing the cumulative value to $4.0 billion.
The contract award ratio for 1999 was
59.6 percent including program loans and
47.3 percent excluding program loans.
Disbursements during the year totaled
$462.1 million, bringing cumulative disbursements to $3.8 billion. The disbursement ratio
for 1999 was 39.4 percent, including program
loans and 16.7 percent excluding program
loans.

The high contract award and disbursement
ratios were mainly attributed to the release of
the second tranche of the Social Sector Program
loan and the release of the first tranche of the
Agriculture Sector Program loan, which was
approved in September.

Project implementation on the whole was
satisfactory. However, delays in achieving physical progress were encountered in the transport
sector mainly due to contractors' financial difficulties arising from the financial crisis.

During the last quarter, the Government
and ADB jointly conducted a review of the
portfolio, focusing on implementation issues
that adversely affected performance. The
portfolio review resulted in (i) an agreed set of
time-bound actions to improve projectRegional and Country Highlights

implementation performance, and (iii) a recommended joint review of the portfolio to be

Viet Nam

Economic performance

Economic growth: In 1999, real GDP growth was
estimated to be 4.4 percent (the official estimate
is 4.8 percent), which is half the average growth
rate experienced during the six years from 1992
until the onset of the regional crisis in 1997.
The slowdown in growth over the last two years
has been due to the indirect impact of the
regional crisis, stagnating domestic demand,
and loss of reform momentum. Sectoral performance in 1999 has been mixed. The growth
of the agriculture sector was higher in 1999
(5.0 percent) than in 1998 (3.0 percent) due to
a bumper rice crop and growth in the fisheries
and livestock industries. The industry and services sector growth were lower in 1999 (7.0 percent and 2.0 percent) than in 1998 (8.3 percent
and 2.5 percent), respectively. The construction
subsector contracted, and the manufacturing
subsector experienced slower growth, with
inventory buildup in key industries including
cement, steel, coal, and fertilizers. The
depressed services, tourism, real estate, and
transportation subsectors were particularly hard
hit by the economic slowdown.

Comparative results of the 1993 and 1998
Living Standards surveys, which became available in 1999, showed that poverty incidence has
dropped from 58 to 37 percent based on a total
poverty line, and from 25 to 15 percent if a lower
food poverty line is used. Broad-based growth,
liberalization of the agriculture sector, and
redistributive policies were behind this impressive achievement. These dramatic gains remain
fragile, as the share of population marginally
above the poverty line remains quite high.

Inflation: Average annual inflation declined
to 0.1 percent in 1999 from more than 9 percent in 1998. The factors mainly responsible for

the falling inflation rate were the decline in the
food price index, slowdown in domestic
demand, a relatively stable exchange rate, and
adherence to a prudent monetary policy.

External sector: Exports recovered significantly in 1999, growing by about 22.3 percent
compared with the previous year's growth of
1 percent. Rice, crude oil, seafood, garments,
and footwear contributed to the pickup in export
growth. Liberalization of export policies, including elimination of export tax on rice and
increased access of the private sector to exports,
also contributed to the strong export performance. Imports recovered by a modest 1.2 percent growth in 1999 compared with a decrease
of 2.1 percent in 1998. With the compression
in imports and resurgence of exports, the current account balance registered a surplus in
1999. FDI continued to fall. The regional concentration of foreign investors—two thirds of
FDI inflows originated in Asia in the precrisis
period—has made FDI inflows vulnerable to
weaker regional GDP growth. Investor
sentiment also remained lukewarm due to
uncertainties about the direction and pace of
reforms in Viet Nam.

Domestic policies: The Government's fiscal and monetary policies remained prudent in
1999. Additional per capita spending to stimulate demand led to a small increase in the fiscal deficit of 1.5 percent. Revenue performance
was disappointing and will need to be improved,
including strengthening the structure and
administrative arrangements for the VAT. Money
supply grew at around 30 percent, mainly
because of the increase in foreign currency
deposits. Several reform measures were undertaken in the critical areas of private sector
development, as well as in the banking, SOE,
and trade subsectors. The Enterprise Reform
Act, which was approved by the National
Assembly in June 1999, provides a strong basis
for liberalizing private entry and unifying the
legal framework for most enterprises. In the
banking subsector, several prudential regulations were issued and preliminary action plans
for restructuring joint-stock and state-owned
commercial banks were developed. Progress in
SOE reform has been slow, limited to selecting
100 large, troubled SOEs for diagnostic audits,ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

 

and completing equitizations (a term that refers
to issuing shares by the affected companies)
for 146 enterprises. In the area of trade reforms,
regulations were issued to reduce the number
of tariff rates, private firms were allowed to
export rice, auctioning of export quotas for garment exports started, and the foreign exchange
surrender requirement was reduced from
80 percent to 50 percent of available balances.
The exchange rate mechanism was also modified in February to allow for greater flexibility
in its determination, based on prevailing
interbank rates.

While these and some other policy
measures taken in 1999 signaled the
Government's commitment to reform, much
more remains to be done. The two years of
comparatively low growth have resulted in rising unemployment, particularly in the urban
areas, declining government revenues, and
further weakening of SOEs and banks. More
importantly, there is concern that the remarkable
progress that Viet Nam has made in the last five
years in reducing poverty will falter unless reform
priorities and a reasonable time frame in which
to achieve them are set out. Priorities include
removing the remaining obstacles to private sector development, SOE restructuring, banking
reform, and trade liberalization.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: The principal objective of
ADB's operational strategy in Viet Nam is to
reduce poverty and promote efficient economic
growth. ADB is currently preparing a new
operational strategy to reflect the changed circumstances after resuming its operations in
1993, notably the significant reduction in poverty achieved through economic growth and
market liberalization, and the emergence of
greater inequalities in income distribution and
access to services between urban and rural
areas. ADB's support to Viet Nam in the medium
term will address critical constraints in the
following areas: (i) policy reform and institutional development, (ii) rural development,
(iii) infrastructure development, (iv) human
development, (v) environmental and natural
resource management, and (vi) subregional

cooperation. The new strategy will focus on
the more disadvantaged central region of
Viet Nam.

Policy dialogue: A vital component of ADB
operations in Viet Nam is to encourage policy
and structural reforms to improve public sector efficiency and develop the private sector. A
policy-based loan in support of banking and
finance sector reform was successfully completed in 1999. Another policy-based loan to
support the Government's efforts to reform

SOEs, improve corporate governance, facilitate
foreign investment inflows, and support the development of private enterprises was approved
in 1999. In addition to program lending, policy
dialogue was an important feature in all of ADB's
loan projects. Dialogue included support for
increased efficiency through tariff reform and
other measures to increase cost recovery and
strengthen financial management, policy
analysis, and planning within state-owned utilities. Policy dialogue also plays an important role
in promoting good governance and improving
natural resource management and environmental protection. To facilitate policy dialogue,
advisory technical assistance was provided to
key government agencies.

Loans and technical assistance: ADB
approved four loans totaling $220 million for
the social infrastructure, transport (including the $25 million loan component of the
Greater Mekong Subregion: East-West
Corridor Project), and finance sectors.
Thirteen technical assistance grants totaling
$10.3 million were also approved, three of
which were for project preparation.

Project implementation: Since becoming a
member in 1966, Viet Nam has received a total
of 39 loans, of which 13 were closed and
26 were still active at the end of 1999. Contracts
worth $250.4 million were awarded during the
year, bringing the cumulative total of contracts
to $843.1 million. The contract award ratio for
1999 was 24.8 percent. Disbursements for the
year totaled $193.8 million, bringing cumulative
disbursements to $576.3 million. The disbursement ratio for 1999 was 16.0 percent.

In the past year, the Government and ADB
took steps to improve portfolio performance in
Viet Nam. These included (i) adopting and disseminating the project accounting manual to
line ministries to assist PMU staff in carrying
out disbursement and project accounting
activities; (ii) organizing training seminars on
procurement procedures; (iii) ensuring that
ADB's guidelines had been followed in all project
implementation activities; (iv) ensuring sufficient counterpart funds and facilitating the

 

efficient use of imprest accounts; (v) issuing and
implementing decisions to further clarify the
Government's disbursement procedures; and
(vi) issuing and implementing the Government's
and ADB's anticorruption policies to promote
good governance. These actions have resulted
in improvements in several aspects of project
implementation, particularly in the allocation
and flow of funds.

Despite these efforts, however, there were
some signs of deterioration in portfolio performance in 1999. The nature of portfolio management issues has shifted with the maturity
of the portfolio. Delays in loan signing and
effectiveness have been acute only for a few
projects, while implementation issues, particularly delays in selecting and fielding consultants, have become the main problem.
Difficulties were encountered in start-up activities, such as establishing and staffing PMUs,
and issuing project-specific operational and
financial regulations. Delays in the last stages
of processing loans and technical assistance
require that the Government's and ADB's procedures be better harmonized. Surplus loan
proceeds have become available in several
projects because of the maturing portfolio and
the remarkably low bids awarded.

South Asia*

The South Asian economies, which remained
relatively unaffected by the Asian financial crisis,
continued with their strong performance in
1999. The subregion achieved a GDP growth of
5.4 percent in 1999, compared with 6.3 percent
in 1998. This growth was achieved despite a
poor agricultural performance in India, a result
of relatively poorer climatic conditions, and
some of the worst floods and natural disasters
in Bangladesh and eastern provinces of India.
The uncertainties resulting from the political
changes in Pakistan also affected the
subregion's economic performance. The sustained growth in GDP in South Asia is a result
of policy reforms that have been undertaken in

4 South Asia includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. ADB has not

had operations in Afghanistan since 1980.ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

      
  

 

  

the past decade and the greater openness of
their economies, which has enabled them to
attract higher volumes of FDI.

The subregion, however, is host to more
than half of Asia's poor. About 500 million of
the 900 million poor in Asia and the Pacific live
in the south Asian subcontinent. A majority of
these are concentrated in the eastern region of
the subcontinent, an area comprising
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal. Other
human development indicators in the region are
also among the lowest in the world.

Sustained pro-poor economic growth,
coupled with an attack on inequities, is
needed to achieve higher human development
indicators. Progress in structural reforms, a
greater commitment to building social safety
networks, and investing in human capital are
critical for the subregion to attain its full
economic potential.

than the immediate postflood estimate of
3.3 percent. Despite the heavy floods,
agriculture sector growth increased to 3.9 percent in FY1998/99, compared with 3.2 percent
in FY1997/98. This was due to the bumper harvest of winter crops, and the Government's
prompt response of launching an agriculture
sector recovery program to recoup the losses
of the summer crops. Industry sector growth,
however, decreased during the same period
from 8.4 percent to 5.0 percent as a result of
flood-induced disruptions to manufacturing
subsector production. The services subsector
maintained a steady growth of 5.0 percent.

Inflation: The inflation rate rose to
8.9 percent in FY1998/99, up from 7.0 percent
in the previous year, because of higher food
prices resulting from a shortage in food supply
and expansionary monetary and fiscal policies.
After the 1999 winter harvest, which partially
offset the losses of the summer harvest, inflation went down to 4.5 percent in September
from 7.7 percent in June.

External sector: The impact of the turbulence in east and southeast Asian financial
markets on the Bangladesh economy has so far
been limited. However, the floods reduced
export performance in FY1998/99, with
export growth declining to 2.9 percent, compared with 16.8 percent in the previous year.
The garment and knitwear subsectors

exports. The growth rate of imports, on the
other hand, increased from 5.1 to 6.6 percent.
Remittances from expatriate workers, however,
maintained an impressive growth of 12.0 percent during the period. The current account
deficit increased from 1.2 to 1.4 percent of GDP.
The foreign exchange reserves have been stable
at about $1.5 billion or 2.2 months of imports
at the end of FY1998/99.

Domestic policies: Public expenditures for
addressing the impact of the floods—additional
food grain imports, postflood rehabilitation
spending, and shortfalls in current revenue
collection because of disrupted economic
activities—resulted in an increased budget
deficit of 5.3 percent of GDP in FY1998/99,
compared with 4.2 percent in the previous year.
To meet the flood-induced budgetary shortfall,
the Government resorted to bank borrowings
amounting to Tk15 billion ($309 million) during
FY1998/99.

In the banking subsector, nonperforming
loans remained substantial with classified loans
increasing to 43.0 percent of total loans
on 30 June 1999, against 41.0 percent on
31 December 1998. Some progress has been
made in recent months, particularly in removing major defaulters from the directorship of
commercial banks. Several initiatives were
under way to amend key banking legislation
and policies to improve the governance, legal
framework, and institutional capacity of the
banking system. Further progress was made in
introducing structural reforms in the economy
in 1999, especially in the finance, industry, and
power sectors. In the finance sector, systematic capital market reform measures have been
introduced to facilitate domestic resource
mobilization. These include establishing an
investor protection fund in the major stock
exchanges, tightening capital adequacy norms
for brokers, implementing automated trading,
and establishing a central depository for the
capital market. ADB's Capital Market Development Program loan has facilitated these adjustments. In the industry sector, the pace of SOE
privatization has been gradual, as in most other
DMCs. However, the privatization bill for
establishing a privatization commission recently
submitted to Parliament will help step up the

 

pace of privatization. In the energy sector,
significant progress was made toward
unbundling generation, transmission, and
distribution functions, which set the basis for
corporatization and future entry of private
investors. ADB assistance has largely
facilitated these efforts.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's strategy for
Bangladesh continued to focus on poverty
reduction by promoting faster private sectorled economic growth, creating better development opportunities for the poor, developing
human resources, and protecting the environment. The new strategy has been reoriented to
include the change in lending philosophy to
focus on reducing poverty as an overarching
objective, the sharper focus on long-term
involvement in selected subsectors, a sector
strategy requirement, and political commitment.

Policy dialogue: In line with the new counry operational strategy and ADB's new poverty
strategy, the main thrust of policy discussions
was on approaches for reducing poverty . The
Government agreed to conclude with ADB a
Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement—one
of the first under the new poverty reduction
strategy—and sought ADB's assistance in prearing for the Agreement. For its part, ADB
agreed to provide this assistance. In 1999, policy
dialogue focused on (i) developing capital
market; (ii) regulating and transforming the
power subsector; (iii) institutional strengthening, capacity building, and long-term planning
in the road subsector; and (iv) reforming the
education system. The Dhaka Power Systems
Upgrade Project will enable effective and efficient evacuation and economic use of the power
generated, and management capacity building
or the agencies concerned in the sector. The
Southwest Road Network Development Project
will open a road corridor to induce economic
growth and create conditions for greater
regional cooperation with possible involvement
of the private sector. The Secondary Education
Sector Project will assist the Government in
implementing its Secondary Education Sector
Development Plan.ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

     

Annual, 1995-1999

Loans and technical assistance: In 1999,
ADB provided four loans amounting to
$332 million, including an ordinary capital
resources (OCR) loan of $82 million. ADB also
approved 15 technical assistance grants totaling
$10.9 million (including $3.5 million financed
exclusively by the Netherlands).

Project implementation: Since ADB started
lending to the country in 1973, Bangladesh has
received 137 loans totaling $5.9 billion. Of these,
98 loans were closed, and 39 loans with a net
loan amount of $2.6 billion were under implementation at the end of 1999.

Contracts worth $295.6 million were
awarded in 1999, bringing the cumulative total
of contracts to $4.2 billion. The contract award
ratio for 1999 was 25.2 percent. Disbursements
for the year totaled $281.5 million, bringing
cumulative disbursements to $4.2 billion. The
disbursement ratio for 1999 was 21.8 percent.
As a result of concerted efforts of the
Bangladesh Resident Mission (BRM) and
executing agencies, project implementation performance, in terms of contract award and disbursement, was better than in 1998. This was
a commendable performance given the increasingly frequent and prolonged strikes during the
peak project implementation period of the last
quarter of the year.

Various measures have been taken by the
Government and ADB to resolve implementation constraints. ADB has coordinated

closely with other external funding agencies
to improve Bangladesh's project implementation capacity. In 1999, ADB conducted a
joint review of the portfolio performance with
the World Bank and prepared an aidememoire detailing an action plan for the
Government. However, progress in implementing the action plan recommendations
has been slow due to inadequate capacity
within the Government and the executing
agencies. During the midterm review meeting of the Bangladesh Development Forum in
September 1999, there was unanimity that
project implementation procedures and
practices in Bangladesh need to be comprehensively reviewed and improved to enhance
portfolio management.

ADB continued to work with the Government to resolve portfolio performance issues;
government representatives and BRM staff
members meet regularly to monitor implementation targets. Efforts were made to expedite
implementation by emphasizing midterm
reviews and review missions. Institutionbuilding efforts were pursued through various
technical assistance activities to improve the
country's capacity to implement ADB-assisted
projects. Establishing a loan disbursement unit
within BRM was another step toward improving portfolio performance.Regional and Country Highlights

Bhutan

Economic performance

Economic growth: Bhutan continued to experience strong growth in output in FY1998/99
(ending 30 June), with real GDP growth at
6 percent. Major hydropower and industry sector projects have expanded construction activities. Higher industry sector growth, particularly
in electricity, was expected after the commissioning of these projects. GNP per capita has
improved gradually and reached $500 in 1998
from $480 in 1997.

Inflation: In FY1998/99, inflation increased
to more than 9 percent because of increases in
food prices in India. Money supply growth
slowed from a high of 42 percent in FY1997/98
to 18 percent in FY1998/99. This represents a
slower increase of net foreign assets from
inflows of foreign aid. The decline in domestic
credit particularly to the Government has also
helped reduce monetary growth from the
previous year.

External sector: Export growth in 1999 was
adversely affected by the floods in the region.
The US dollar value of exports declined by
6 percent in FY1998/99, compared with the
strong growth of 12 percent in FY1997/98
caused by weaker external demand. In addition,
import growth of 20 percent as a result of
requirements for large hydropower projects
being constructed has resulted in substantial
widening of the trade deficit from 6.4 percent
of GDP to 15 percent, and the current account
deficit from 12 percent of GDP to 26 percent.
Bhutan reversed the slight trade surplus with
India, the country's main trading partner, last
year to a trade deficit of 4.8 percent of GDP.
The bilateral trade in services contributed to a
current account deficit of almost 18.6 percent
of GDP, compared with 6.6 percent last year.
Capital flows, mostly in the form of aid for
infrastructure investments, were more than sufficient to cover the current account deficit,
resulting in an overall balance-of-payments
surplus of more than 26 percent of GDP. This
surplus helped to accumulate foreign exchange
reserves that reached about $259 million at the
end of FY1998/99, equivalent to almost

 

19 months of imports. External debt, mainly
from multilateral development agencies, continued to be small. At the end of FY1998/99, total
public external debt was less than 30 percent
of GDP. Debt service in FY1998/99 was about
9 percent of merchandise export earnings, well
within prudent limits.

Domestic policies: The Government
continued to conduct a prudent fiscal policy,
with current revenues exceeding current
expenditures in FY1998/99. Inflows of foreign
grants were not sufficient to cover development
expenditure, leading to an overall budget deficit
of 2.4 percent of GDP, compared with a 3.3 percent surplus in the previous year. The deterioration in the country's fiscal stance was because
of a major increase in capital expenditure for
hydropower and industrial projects, which were
financed by concessional donor assistance. The
77" session of the National Assembly, which
concluded in August 1999, passed several
important bills, including the Telecommunications Act, Road Safety and Transport Act,
Bankruptcy Act, Immovable and Movable
Property Act, and Municipal Act. These acts
are expected to strengthen the legal framework for a market-oriented economy and the
capacity of the central and local government
units to manage development on a sustainable basis. Under a new system of government, the King remains the head of state, but
he is no longer the head of the Government.
The latter position is now being rotated among
members of the Cabinet of Ministers on an
annual basis. In November, the Government
released a report to enhance good governance
by promoting efficiency, transparency, and
accountability. Specific recommendations
were proposed, including reorganizing the
government administration. Implementation
is expected to be completed by 2002.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB is finalizing a new
strategy for Bhutan. Translating ADB's
overarching goal of poverty reduction into a
strategy and operational program that reflects
the reality of Bhutan's development context
requires considering the (i) nature and degreeANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

of poverty in Bhutan, (ii) effectiveness in
addressing basic human needs of the
Government's economic and social development programs, (iii) access to grant funds from
other multilateral and bilateral funding agencies, (iv) debt-servicing and project implementation capacities, and (v) initiatives of other
funding agencies. In addition, in making a small
program effective, ADB must be selective to
avoid spreading resources too thinly. Reducing
poverty requires continued economic growth,
together with the continued spread of health,
education, and other facilities, to include all
groups as potential beneficiaries. ADB will
support poverty reduction in Bhutan by
promoting pro-poor economic growth and
social inclusiveness through interventions in
physical and social infrastructure, private
sector development, employment creation,
and improved economic management. ADB's
concern for poverty reduction will be
addressed through income and employment
generation impact of private sector-led
development brought about by (i) better policy
setting and more efficient financial intermediation, (ii) better road transport and
expanded power transmission and distribution, and (iii) strengthened vocational,
technical, and basic skills.

supporting the implementation of the country’s
operational strategy includes (i) promoting

private sector development, (ii) improving the
efficiency of public service delivery and cost
recovery, and (iii) protecting the environment.
ADB will continue to support the Government's
efforts to provide an enabling environment for
private sector development by (i) rationalizing
and strengthening banking and financial institutions; (ii) continuing the liberalization of
foreign trade, exchange, and investment
regulations; (iii) liberalizing interest rates so that
they reflect the true underlying cost of resource
mobilization, intermediation, and risk; and
(iv) preparing transparent legislation and regulatory procedures. In the energy sector, the key
policy objectives include pursuing financial
viability and sustainability of power operations
by corporatizing the Division of Power and promoting private sector participation in power
development. ADB also supports ongoing efforts
to increase domestic resource mobilization,
including improving the cost recovery of public service delivery, particularly in health and
urban services.

Loans and technical assistance: ADB provided a $10 million loan for sustainable rural
electrification, covering more than 6,000 new
customers in rural villages in 16 districts. Five

Project implementation: Since ADB started
lending to Bhutan in 1983, 15 loans totaling
$75.2 million have been approved. As of
31 December 1999, there were six ongoing loans
with $12.6 million undisbursed. Contracts worth
$2.2 million were awarded during the year,
bringing the cumulative total to $47.5 million.
The contract award ratio for 1999 was 7 percent. Disbursements for the year totaled
$2.1 million, bringing cumulative disbursements
to $47.2 million. The disbursement ratio for
1999 was 13.9 percent.

Since 1998, the Government has undertaken various measures to address issues
raised to improve portfolio performance and
its management. Liquidation of imprest
accounts and timely submission of audited
project accounts have improved. However,
efforts need to be continued to further
enhance portfolio performance, including
improving compliance with loan covenants
and program conditions. A list of key issues
discussed in the 1999 country portfolio review
mission includes (i) portfolio restructuring and
management, (ii) loan effectiveness, (iii) establishment and maintenance of project implementation structure, (iv) recruitment of consultants,
(v) contract awards and administrative
procedures, (vi) disbursement of loan proceeds
and release of counterpart funds, (vii) imprest
accounts, (viii) submission of audited accounts,
(ix) loan extension and ADB review mission,
(x) project performance rating system,
(xi) project quality; (xii) performance-based
lending, (xiii) anticorruption provisions in
guidelines for procurement and use of consultants, and (xiv) compliance with environmental
and social measures.

The Government supports ADB's poverty
reduction strategy and confirms that the framework is consistent with the overall development
objectives of the country. Bhutan's Planning
Commission Secretariat recently constituted a
focal point at its Strategic Planning Division to
coordinate and enhance activities and efforts
toward poverty reduction.

India

Economic performance

Economic growth: During FY1999/2000 (ending
31 March), the Indian economy was on the way
to recovery, with industrial output clearly on
an upward trend. The industry sector grew, with
the index of industrial production up by 6.2 percent during the first nine months of the year,
compared with 3.7 percent in the previous corresponding period. Underlying this better performance was double-digit growth in the
consumer durable subsector, machinery, and
cement production, resulting in the revival of
growth in manufacturing from 3.9 percent
during April-December 1998 to 6.7 percent
during April-December 1999. The growth rate
of the services subsector, which showed a modest decline in FY1998/99, bounced back to the

previous year's level o
the national election

about 8.0 percent. After
in September—October

1999, investor confidence was boosted. How
ever, because of wea
agriculture sector, GD

er performance of the
P growth in FY1999/2000

declined to 5.9 percent, compared with
6.8 percent in the previous year. With the
below-normal monsoon in some areas and a
serious blow from the cyclone that hit the
Orissa Coast in October 1999, growth of the
agriculture sector slowed from the strong performance of 7.2 percent in 1998. Food grain
production fell short of the previous year’s
level of about 200 million tons because of the
erratic rainfall in some states.

The fiscal situation at both central and state
levels continued to deteriorate, further causing serious concern for maintaining macroeconomic balances. The fiscal revenue of the central
Government fell short of the target, while the
rapid expansion of expenditure (particularly
nonplan expenditure) continued. Consequently,
the overall fiscal deficit of the central Government rose to 5.5 percent of GDP in FY1999/2000,
36 percent higher than the target for the year.
The fiscal deficit at the state level, projected at
4 percent of GDP, exceeded 5 percent largely
because of the sharp increase in wage expenditure following the implementation of the recommendations by the Fifth Pay Commission.ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

Inflation: The inflation rate for FY19992000,
measured by the year-on-year changes in the
monthly averages of the wholesale price index
(WPI), was 3.3 percent—a considerable decline,
following an inflation rate of 6.9 percent in the
previous year. The growth of WPI on a year-onyear basis fell primarily because of low inflation
in the prices of primary goods (3.0 percent) and
manufactured goods (1.8 percent). Relatively
stable prices in these sectors enabled the
economy to absorb a 9.0 percent rise in prices
of fuels and lubricants without increasing the
rate of inflation. Consumer price inflation, as
measured by CPI for industrial workers, slowed
to 3.3 percent in FY1999/2000, compared with
12.9 percent in the previous year.

External sector: With the rebound in Asia
and the recovery in the global economy, exports
in FY1999/2000 are estimated to grow at more
than 10 percent in US dollar terms after the disappointing 3.9 percent decline in the last fiscal
year. The strong performance in manufacturing exports, at 12.9 percent during the first nine
months of the year, was the driving force for
the recovery. Imports in US dollar terms also
recovered, estimated to have grown at 9.0 percent for the year, compared with last year's
growth of 0.9 percent. The growth of imports
was primarily because of the substantial
increase in the prices of crude oil and petroleum products during the first half of the year,
although the decline in non-oil imports slightly
offset the overall increase in imports. Despite
the surge in oil prices, the current account deficit in FY1999/2000 was contained at 1.5 percent of GDP because of the solid performance
in invisible incomes, primarily from private
remittances and software exports.

Despite positive economic prospects and
increased political stability, FDI flows
declined by 17.4 percent to $1.3 billion during the first eight months in FY1999/2000,
which is a cause for concern. However, foreign investment flows (direct plus institutional investments in the stock markets)
increased sharply to $3.1 billion during the
first nine months of FY1999/2000—almost
thrice the $1.1 billion received during the
corresponding period in FY1998/99. This is
mainly because of the marked turnaround of

portfolio investment from $752 million outflows to $1.2 billion net inflows during the
period.

By the end of February 2000, foreign
exchange reserves (excluding gold and special
drawing rights), estimated at $32.8 billion or
eight months equivalent of imports, have
increased by $3.3 billion, compared with the
level at the end of last fiscal year. Reflecting
the stable outlook of the external economy, the
pressure on the exchange rate eased compared
with that of the previous year. Consequently,
the rupee (Rs) to US dollar exchange rate
depreciated by an average of 2.8 percent during the first 10 months of the year, compared
with the 7.6 percent depreciation in FY1998/99.

Domestic policies: In view of the rapidly
growing fiscal deficit, the central Government's
budget for FY1999/2000 proposed several measures for fiscal strengthening. The budget simplified excise taxes and customs duties, raised
levels of income taxes and corporate taxes, and
increased duty rates and the prices of diesel fuel.
The budget also proposed to quicken the pace
of disinvestment with a target of Rs100 billion
for FY1999/2000. In a recent effort of deepening tax reforms, state governments have unanimously agreed to implement uniform floor rates
for a sales tax, and to phase out sales tax-based
incentives for industries by 1 January 2000. They
have also agreed to introduce a unified VAT
regime throughout the country by | April 2001.
The lack of adequate measures for containing
the expansion of government expenditures,
however, remains a cause for concern. The
Government's budget documents showed that
the Government's staff strength, excluding the
railways subsector, increased by 1.5 percent in
FY1999/2000. Although a proposal to cut fertilizer and food subsidies was made, it was partially rolled back before Parliament could
approve the budget.

For FY1999/2000, the monetary and credit
policies continued improving short-term liquidity along with stable medium- and long-term
interest rates. Responding to the reduction in
the cash reserve ratio and the bank rate in
March and April 1999, bank deposits and nonfood credits grew more rapidly during the first
half of FY1999/2000 than in the previous period.Regional and Country Highlights

117

 

The Government's export-import policy for
FY1999/2000 moved toward a more liberal trade
regime with reduced quantitative restrictions
and tariffs; although the latter, with a ceiling of
30 percent, is still among the highest in the
region. Parliament approved the Patent Bills in
March 1999. In the insurance market, Parliament approved the highly publicized Insurance
Regulatory and Development Agency Bill in
December 1999, paving the way to opening the
insurance market to private domestic and foreign investors. In the telecommunications
subsector, the Government's new policy,
approved in March 1999, included reform measures that aim to remove entry/exit barriers and
increase competition. The national long distance service will be opened to private operators
starting 1 January 2000. Moreover, a government ordinance in January 2000 has restructured the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India,
and created an independent dispute settlement
body for the telecommunications subsector.
Recently, measures to open up all sectors (with
the exception of several industries) to FDI participation was announced in a bid to increase
FDI inflows.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's operational strategy
for India is designed to support efforts to promote employment and reduce poverty through
improved efficiency, sustainable pro-poor economic growth, and better development opportunities for the poor. These objectives are to be
achieved by reducing bottlenecks in key infrastructure sectors; developing and improving the
enabling environment for private sector investment; improving public resource mobilization
and management at the state level, including
enhancing resource allocation for social sectors;
and strengthening the focus on urban
development, environmental improvement, and
housing finance to reduce poverty. Consistent
with its overall strategy, ADB's operational program continues to be guided by the principle of
selectivity in both sectoral and geographic
aspects, with state-level operations accounting
for up to 50 percent of annual lending in the
next few years.

and sanitation, drainage and sewerage, and
solid waste management, and by strengthening the institutional framework for urban
infrastructure financing.

Loans and technical assistance: Five loans
for three projects, totaling $625 million, were
approved in 1999. Four loans amounting to
$375 million were for the social infrastructure
sector (urban and environment, and health and
nutrition) and one for a public resource management program ($250 million). Eleven technical assistance grants totaling $7.2 million
were approved.

Project implementation: Since ADB started
lending in 1986, India has received a total of
57 loans amounting to $7.9 billion, of which
22 were closed and 35 were being implemented
at the end of 1999. Contracts worth $557.4 million were awarded during the year, bringing the
cumulative total of contracts to $5.3 billion. The
contract award ratio for 1999 was 14.5 percent.
Disbursements for the year totaled $605.2 million exceeding the projection by 55 percent and
bringing cumulative disbursements to $5.0 billion. The high disbursement ratio of 32.9 percent in 1998 increased to 35.2 percent in 1999
as against ADB average of 22.2 percent.

Project implementation, which has
improved lately, continued to suffer from some
weaknesses. The project implementation structure, as envisaged during loan negotiations, has
also failed in some cases because it was established without sufficient authority to implement
decisions. Government attention has been
drawn to these weaknesses to improve portfolio performance. The mandatory use of ADB's
sample bidding documents has been implemented since 1 July 1999. As agreed in the 1998
Action Plan, the Government constituted a
working group in August 1999 to study the
release of funds for externally assisted projects

from the central Government to the state governments to ensure adequate funds for timely
project implementation.

ADB's 1999 country portfolio review
mission notified the Government of the need
to improve the timeliness of submission of
audited project accounts and financial statements. The mission informed the Government
about the option of using private auditors in
situations where inordinate delays in the audit
of project accounts were envisaged.

Of the 10 specific time-bound actions agreed
during the 1998 country portfolio review, six
actions have been complied with. The Government
is still studying two actions related to funds flow,
and another one has been implemented. The
Government also agreed to implement a number of actions outlined in the action plan of the
1999 country portfolio review.

Maldives

Economic performance

Economic growth: During the last three years,
the Maldives' economy grew in real terms
between 8 and 9 percent. The strong growth
performance has been the result of favorable
developments in tourism, fisheries, manufacturing (including electricity and water supply),
and transport and telecommunications
industries. Growth in 1999 is estimated at
8.5 percent with tourist arrivals increasing
by about 10 percent to around 430,000.
Increased growth in tourism continued to
facilitate the construction of resorts, the
growth of transportation subsectors, and the
development of basic infrastructure facilities.
In addition, the fisheries subsector remained
buoyant in 1999, despite lower fish prices in
the international market.

Inflation: As fish is the principal food item
measured by the CPI, the increase in domestic
fish production had a favorable impact on
inflation. The annual average inflation rate was
estimated at 4 percent in 1999. Given the fixed
exchange rate for the rufiyaa against the US dollar,
the Asian financial crisis had a positive impact on
domestic inflation by lowering import prices.Regional and Country Highlights

119

 

External sector: The current account deficit deteriorated to 7.7 percent of GDP in 1999
from 7 percent in 1998 because of increased
imports associated with investments in the
tourism subsector. In addition, exports also
declined in 1999. The current account deficit
has, however, been more than offset by capital
(especially private capital) inflows, thereby
enabling the official reserves to rise to the
equivalent of more than four months of imports.
External debt as a percentage of GDP reached
49.8 percent in 1998. The debt service ratio
remained below 4 percent during the past five
years, except in 1997, when full payment was
made on a $15 million loan provided by the
Kuwait Fund for balance-of-payments support
in 1993.

Domestic policies: To achieve a sustainable
economic growth, the Maldives needs to
continue structural reforms of the economy,
including fiscal consolidation by broadening the
current tax base, and to enhance the efficiency
of the public sector and financial system. Human
resource development and regional development are also important areas of concern for
sustainable growth in the medium term.

assistance from ADB will take into account the
Government's development priorities and ADB's
overarching objective of poverty reduction. Key
areas of support will include (i) regional development through the provision of basic social
and economic infrastructures to help achieve
growth with equity; (ii) human development,
especially through higher education and skills
training; (iii) environmental management for
sustainable growth; and (iv) increased public
sector efficiency and private sector growth.
Support to develop further the finance sector
is also essential to assist the country in mobilizing long-term commercial financing to meet
the needs of the private sector.

Policy dialogue: The principal areas of
policy dialogue between ADB and the Government in the context of regional development
include (i) equitable development across
islands, (ii) environmental protection, and
(iii) increased private sector participation in the
economy. Other important areas include
enhancing the Government's audit and public
accounting capacities, developing a system of
national accounts, developing the legal system,
and encouraging private sector participation in
port operations, including corporatizing the
Maldives Ports Authority.

Loans and technical assistance: One loan
amounting to $8.0 million was approved in 1999
for regional development. ADB also approved
three technical assistance grants totaling
$1.8 million. Technical assistance was provided
to the Government to prepare a project to

expand and upgrade the power supply system
in the outer islands, establish a modern public
accounting system, and strengthen the institutional capacity of legal education and
judicial training. ADB and the Government
conducted a joint country portfolio review in
November 1999.

Project implementation: Since becoming a
member of ADB in 1978, the Maldives has
received a total of nine loans, of which six were
closed and three were ongoing at the end of
1999, including one to become effective in
February 2000. Contracts worth $300,000 were
awarded during the year, bringing the cumulative total to $35.2 million. The contract award
ratio for 1999 was 1.7 percent. Disbursements
amounted to $610,000 in 1999, with cumulative disbursements reaching $34.8 million. The
disbursement ratio for 1999 was 4.5 percent.
The relatively low contract award and disbursement ratios are indicative of the intermittent
and relatively low level of lending to the country and of the early stages of implementation
of all projects under administration.

Nepal

Economic performance

Economic growth: Despite the uncertainty
caused by the changes in the Government,
Nepal's macroeconomy was stable in FY1998/99
(ending 15 July). Real GDP growth rose to
3.3 percent in FY1998/99 from 2.6 percent in
the previous year, led by better performance in
both the agriculture and industry sectors. While
the 2.4 percent growth in agriculture fell short
of projections in the Agriculture Perspective
Plan, the increase over the previous year's rate
of 1.0 percent was promising despite poor
weather conditions. Favorable monsoon and
wider use of fertilizer have led to a strong
recovery in agriculture during the first quarter
of FY1999/2000. Production of food grains,
particularly rice and vegetables, was expected
to exceed average growth rates, which will lead
to growth in overall GDP of 5-6 percent for
FY1999/2000. Early indicators show downturn
in tourism and negligible growth in carpet

exports, though merchandise exports suggest
strong performance. However, with no large
projects coming onstream until the end of the
fiscal year, electricity growth should continue
to be slow.

Inflation: Money growth continued to be
high, despite slower inflows of foreign assets.
M2 increased by about 18 percent in FY1998/99,
compared with 22 percent in the previous year.
Inflation rose to about 13 percent from 4 percent in the previous year, driven by rising food
grain and vegetable prices that resulted from
poor monsoon conditions during the year.
Exports of rice averted the usual downturn in
the rice price after the main harvest. The food
and beverage index rose by 17.3 percent. In
contrast, inflation from nonfood items was
rather moderate at 4.3 percent, about a percentage point lower than the previous year's
rate. This occurred because of the stability of
key administered prices, notably kerosene,
electricity, and diesel.

External sector: In FY1998/99, Nepal's current account deficit turned into a surplus for
the first time in two decades because of strong
export growth and a contraction in imports.
However, the decline in imports was mainly for
aid-related items because of the slowdown in
investment activity prior to the elections. Nonaid imports were roughly on a par with those
of the previous year. While loan disbursements
from funding agencies also slowed prior to the
elections, the country's foreign exchange
reserves continued to rise. The current account
surplus could turn into a deficit in FY1999/2000
as aid-related imports return to their previous
levels, particularly if the Government succeeds in its ambitious development agenda
for the year. External debt as a percentage of
GDP has risen over time with foreign debt
reaching 54.5 percent of GDP in FY1998/99.
However, because of the concessional nature
of lending, the external debt service ratio was
at a manageable level of 6.1 percent of export
earnings, a situation that should continue in
FY1999/2000.

Domestic policies: While the recently
elected Government raised expectations of
reform, progress has been slow. The increase
in VAT registrations is a promising sign, but keyRegional and Country Highlights

121

 

vacancies in the VAT department need to be
filled to improve administration, clear the filing backlog, initiate collection visits, and
intensify audit activity. The Government also
recently raised prices of kerosene, diesel, and
electricity, and removed all subsidies on
fertilizers, making these prices the highest in
South Asia. Despite vocal public protests against
these measures and a special parliamentary
session called by the opposition to review the
price increases, the Government has so far
stood firm on its decisions, which will improve
both the fiscal balances and overall resource
allocation in the economy.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: A new strategy for Nepal
was approved in 1999. The overarching
objective of the strategy is to achieve a sustainable reduction in poverty through (i) generating
productive employment opportunities and
increased rural incomes resulting from faster
and broad-based economic growth, (ii) equitable
improvements in basic social services to
enhance human development resulting in a
reduced population growth, and (iii) protecting
and improving the environment to sustain gains.
A major difficulty in achieving these objectives
is the lack of efficiency, predictability, transparency, and accountability in key development
and market institutions. Thus, the approach of
the new strategy is to build effective institutions
needed to implement socioeconomic development in a market economy. Five key elements
of the strategy will be emphasized to achieve
ADB's operational objectives and build effective
institutions in Nepal. The first—improved
governance—will require policy and institutional reforms, particularly to strengthen key
institutions in undertaking a changing role
to promote private sector participation. The
second element—support for the Government's initiative in decentralization, including
support for local administrations (village
development committees and district
development committees) to plan and implement development activities and better serve
local needs—is also an important crosscutting element of the strategy. The three other

strategic elements include private sector
development, gender equity, and subregional
cooperation.

Policy dialogue: The new strategy emphasizes that building capacity to maximize and
sustain the development impact of investments
must take precedence over levels of assistance.
Strong stakeholder support for ADB's proposed
interventions will be a prerequisite for future
interventions, as will be the formulation of longterm institutional development strategies, with
clearly identified road maps for sector development. Improved monitoring and supervision
by ADB will need to focus on implementing road
maps as a criterion in annual country programming. ADB will take the necessary measures to
ensure satisfactory compliance with loan
covenants during project implementation. ADB
support to particular sectors/subsectors will
depend on progress toward strengthening the
policy and institutional environment in them.
A clearly documented assessment of the policy
and institutional environment will be required
before considering new investment projects.
Longer-term technical assistance will support
the policy and institutional reforms needed to
create such an environment.

To use ADB's limited concessional resources
effectively, sharper focus on fewer sectors/
subsectors will be necessary. In implementing
he new strategy, ADB will further emphasize
roject design issues, economic and sector
work, improved funding agency coordination,
and subregional cooperation. In line with ADB's
policy, future lending to Nepal will be linked to
rogress in addressing the major country
erformance issues that will improve the
environment for private and public investments
O generate and sustain development impact.
rhe five key areas include human development,
iscal performance, civil service reform,
governance, and portfolio performance.
Performance standards were established
accordingly for further monitoring and
evaluating achievements. These key areas are
essential to develop effective institutions,
hereby ensuring sustained development impact. Progress reports, which will be prepared
jointly by ADB and the Government, will be part
of the annual country assistance plan for Nepal.ANNUAL REPORT 1999

Loans and technical assistance: In 1999,
ADB approved one loan to Nepal for $50 million in the power subsector. Eleven technical
assistance grants totaling $4.5 million were
approved.

Project implementation: Since ADB started
lending in 1969, Nepal has received a total of
95 loans for $1.7 billion, of which 70 were closed
and 25 were still active at the end of 1999.
Contracts worth $27.8 million were awarded
during the year, bringing the cumulative total
to $1.2 billion. The contract award ratio for 1999
was 12.1 percent. Disbursements for the year
totaled $78.7 million, bringing cumulative

disbursements to $1.2 billion. The disbursement
ratio for 1999 was 21.2 percent.

Project implementation faced problems,
such as the Government's resumption of
premature transfer of key project personnel,
inadequate staffing of some loan and technical
assistance projects, lack of procedural guidelines in project implementation, delays in
submission and unsatisfactory quality of
audited accounts, and lack of ownership of technical assistance by some executing agencies.
Technical assistance to formulate an action plan
for civil service reform was also initiated during
the year. The Nepal Resident Mission continued
to support improved project implementation by
holding monthly meetings with project
directors/managers. An action plan agreed to
by the Government and ADB was prepared, in
addition to the country portfolio review action
plan to improve implementation performance.
Sectoral milestones were prepared to allow
monitoring of sectoral performance as part of
the operational strategy’s shift to performancebased lending. ADB has strengthened its focus
on governance and capacity-building efforts in
the past few years. The Government also
enhanced decentralization and people's participation in development activities. The local
governance bill was passed by the Parliament
in September 1999.

Delayed submission of audited project
accounts and financial statements is a persistent problem. To address this problem and to
be in line with ADB's Anticorruption Policy, the
1999 review mission reiterated that, effective
1 January 2000, ADB will move to suspend loans
if their audited project accounts and financial
statements are delayed by 12 months. The 1999
action plan seeks to reinforce the Government's
sense of ownership and commitment toward
ADB's ongoing portfolio of loan and technical
assistance projects with the aim of further
improving portfolio management and
performance.

Given the many common implementation
issues that have adversely affected ADB's and
the World Bank's loan and technical assistance
portfolio performance in Nepal, a joint country
portfolio review will be conducted in 2000. This
approach will provide both multilateralRegional and Country Highlights

institutions, which are major providers of
funds to Nepal, with a common platform for
complementary efforts and consistent policy
advice to assist the Government and executing
agencies concerned in improving portfolio
performance.

Pakistan

Economic performance

Economic growth: FY1998/99 (ending 30 June)
was a challenging year for Pakistan. Economic
performance during the year was adversely
affected by the impact of extraordinary policy
measures, adopted in the face of sanctions
imposed by G-7 countries? in the wake of the
May 1998 nuclear tests. Economic growth
slowed to 3.1 percent in FY1998/99, compared
with 4.3 percent in FY1997/98. While the
economic sanctions and resultant foreign
currency crisis had an adverse impact on
industry sector growth, the agriculture sector
suffered from poor weather conditions and crop
diseases. The growth of the agriculture sector
was only 0.4 percent in FY1998/99, down from
3.8 percent in the previous year. As a result of
drastic declines in domestic and foreign investment and a contraction of imports, the growth
rate of the manufacturing subsector declined
to 4.7 percent, compared with 7.9 percent in
the previous year. The services subsector, on
the other hand, performed slightly better,
mainly because of the improved performance
in the finance and insurance services
subsectors. Fiscal and financial discipline,
which was the priority in the ongoing structural
reforms, yielded encouraging results. The fiscal
deficit declined in two consecutive years from
6.4 percent of GDP in FY1996/97 to 5.4 percent
in FY1997/98, and to 4.3 percent in FY1998/99.
A general sales tax (GST) increase from
12.5 percent to 15 percent helped boost tax
collection.

In the first half of FY1999/2000, the
economy showed a slow recovery. Large-scale

 

industry sector growth rebounded strongly, and
production also showed an improvement.
Cotton production reached 10.5 million bales,
about 20 percent more than the previous year.
The fiscal position also improved as revenue
collections increased by 20 percent during the
same period.

Inflation: A tight monetary policy was pursued and the rate of M2 growth was as low as
6.3 percent, the lowest broad money growth in
he entire 1990s. The rate of inflation declined
0 5.7 percent in FY1998/99, a record low level
in the last 12 years, reflecting slow growth in
aggregate demand complemented by a tight
monetary policy. The inflation rate remained
ow at 3.4 percent from July to November 1999
as against 6 percent during the same period in
FY1998/99.

External sector: Export earnings on
alance-of-payments basis for FY1998/99 conracted by 10.2 percent over FY1997/98. Imports
also declined by 9.3 percent during FY1998/99.
n the services account, workers' remittances
and foreign currency account deposits also
dropped sharply as a result of uncertainty on
policies. However, the current account deficit
in FY1998/99 amounted to $1.8 billion or
2.9 percent of GDP, slightly lower than in
FY1997/98. The foreign exchange reserves
amounted to $1.8 billion by the end of
FY1998/99, equivalent to about two months
of imports.

However, the fragile balance-of-payments
osition remains the country's primary concern.
While export earnings picked up by 7.4 percent
during the first half of FY1999/2000, imports
increased more sharply by 11.5 percent, mainly
cause of the rise in petroleum product prices
in the world market. As a result, the trade deficit
deteriorated to $783 million during the period,
rom $563 million in the first half of
FY1998/99. Foreign exchange reserves declined
0 $1.5 billion in January 2000, equivalent to
ess than two months of imports.

Domestic policies: Despite economic difficulties, the Government continued to pursue
economic reforms. To reduce the budget deficit,

 

5 The G-7 countries include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, and United States.ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

the reform program included (i) increasing the
GST rate from 12.5 percent to 15 percent,
(ii) increasing the price of petroleum products,
(iii) decreasing the budget allocation for expenditures with low priority, and (iv) reducing the
federal subsidy on wheat. Under the assistance
of the Structural Adjustment Loan of the World
Bank, some actions were undertaken to improve
governance in key public sector activities of
banking, tax administration, public utilities, and
public expenditure. Under the ADB-financed
Trade, Export Promotion and Industry Program,
approved in March 1999, the Government
further liberalized Pakistan's trade regime
by reducing tariff and trade barriers by
(i) reducing the maximum tariff from 65 percent to 35 percent, (ii) reducing the number of
slab rates from 14 to 5, (iii) abolishing the
10 percent regulatory duty, and (iv) reducing
outstanding export and import restrictions.
However, the privatization program remains
stalled and the long-standing disputes between
the Government and some of the independent
power producers remain unresolved. An early
resolution of these disputes is vital to revive
the confidence of private investors.

After the military takeover in October 1999,
the new Government announced its broad
development strategy and economic revival
plan. It identified four priority areas for reviving the economy: revitalizing the agriculture
sector, promoting small- and medium-scale
industries, expanding the oil and gas subsector,
and promoting the information technology
industry. A comprehensive poverty reduction
strategy is also being prepared by the Government. Several activities were initiated in the area
of poverty reduction, including allocating
Pakistan rupees (PR) 15-20 billion annually for
poverty reduction projects, improving the poor’s
access to financial services by establishing a
microcredit bank, and revitalizing the food
stamp program.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: The strategy that was
prepared for Pakistan in 1995 emphasized
human development, which had been lagging
despite relatively high growth rates during the

1980s. Emphasis was on enhancing the quality
and delivery of services through the greater
involvement of nongovernment organizations
(NGOs) and the private sector, and more
importantly, on improving the economic environment for the private sector to take over areas
of the economy that were previously the domain
of the public sector. While the strategic objectives remain broadly valid, especially for the
longer term, it has been necessary to make
adjustments to respond to the difficult economic
environment. During 1998, a country operational framework for a consolidation period
(1999-2000) and beyond was developed to
define the focus of ADB assistance and further
improve the balance of payments, increase
economic efficiency, and promote sustained
human and social development.

Policy dialogue: Policy and institutional
reforms continued to be the focus of policy
dialogue to improve public sector governance
and efficiency, and promote private sector
growth. In view of the financial crisis and the
difficulties in implementing the strategy over
recent years, policy dialogue centered on
resolving three main issues. ADB and the
Government addressed poor portfolio performance by increasing emphasis on linking the
program to portfolio performance. Weak governance was recognized as a main factor contributing to the poor delivery of government
services; to address this decentralization,

incentives are needed, such as increased
transparency in decision making and more
effective legal systems and tax reforms.
Ongoing economic and sector work reviewed
the reasons for low absorptive capacity in
Pakistan and the need to improve governance,
efficiency, and effectiveness of investments
in human resource development. Policy
dialogue continued in each of these areas in
all sectors of ADB's program.

Loans and technical assistance: Seven loans
amounting to $402.8 million were approved in
1999 in the industry, agriculture, and social
infrastructure sectors, including three technical assistance loans for $7 million. ADB also
approved seven technical assistance grants
amounting to $2.1 million.

Project implementation: Since 1968,
Pakistan has received a total of 185 loans, of
which 131 were closed and 54 were still active
at the end of 1999. Contracts worth $347.4 million were awarded during the year, bringing the
cumulative total of contracts to $7.1 billion. The
contract award ratio for 1999 was 22.8 percent.
Disbursements for the year totaled $476.2 million, bringing cumulative disbursements to
$7.3 billion. The disbursement ratio for 1999
was 23.5 percent.

Delays in project implementation are common in Pakistan. Weak governance and low
institutional capacity of public sector agencies
has had an adverse impact on timely project
implementation and full achievement of
projects’ development goals. Greater utilization
should be made of past ADB assistance for
capacity building. To address this situation, ADB
and the Government have developed a framework to monitor compliance with specific
institutional and policy covenants embedded in
various project and loan agreements. Greater
government involvement in project design
would contribute toward ownership and
sustainability of ADB-assisted projects. To
achieve these objectives, the Government has
agreed to prepare draft proposals with the goal
of ensuring greater government participation
in project formulation.

Delays in recruitment of consultants, submission of qualified audited statements, and
slow release of counterpart funds affected
implementation performance of some ADBassisted projects. These and other issues are

under a comprehensive portfolio management

and other stakeholders for this purpose.

Sri Lanka

Economic performance

Economic growth: After achieving a moderate
growth of 4.7 percent in 1998, Sri Lanka
recorded a lower economic growth of 4.2 percent in 1999. This was mainly the result of
declining industry sector output in response
to slackening world and domestic demand.
During the first half of 1999, the sector recorded
a moderate growth of 3.8 percent. The overall
performance of the industry sector improved
in the second quarter of 1999, reflecting a
gradual improvement in exports. The agriculture sector performed well as reflected in the
increased outputs of plantation crops,
vegetables, and fruits. Output levels of tea grew
by 1.3 percent, rubber by 3.9 percent, andANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

 

 

coconut by 10.0 percent. Growth in construction activity was largely the result of increased
government expenditure on infrastructure
projects, and large-scale housing and commercial building projects (funded by both local and
foreign private investments).

Inflation: The Government's monetary
policy in 1999 was aimed at maintaining
financial market stability, while helping
strengthen the declining trends in inflation.
Domestic inflation declined to 5.0 percent in
1999, compared with 9.4 percent in 1998. Major
factors contributing to the decline included
improved domestic supply of food items,
prudent macroeconomic management by the
Government, and lower import prices that have
contained the growth of domestic prices.

External sector: Developments in the
external sector in 1999 reflect the lag effects
ofthe depressed global demand and the
resultant decline in commodity prices. Exports
declined by 3.1 percent in 1999, as export prices
of tea, rubber, textile, and garment products
declined. Imports increased by 0.1 percent.
Consumer goods imports decreased by
0.3 percent, intermediate goods by 1.6 percent. Investment goods increased by 6.0 percent. The current account deficit widened to
about 3.7 percent of GDP in 1999, compared
with 1.8 percent in 1998, with the purchase
of aircraft for Sri Lankan Airlines in October
1999. External debt, which was 56.7 percent
of GDP in 1998, rose to 58.6 percent in 1999.
The Sri Lanka rupee (SLR) further depreciated
by 5 percent in 1999, trading at SLR72.6 per
US dollar at the end of the year. The steady
depreciation of the rupee was expected to
maintain the country's export competitiveness. Gross official reserves, which were
recorded at $2 billion in 1998, decreased to
$1.7 billion at the end of 1999, sufficient to
finance 3.3 months of imports.

Domestic policies: The Government
achieved considerable progress in the structural
reform agenda, which included tax reforms and
private sector participation in gas, power,
telecommunications, aviation, and plantations.
To sustain growth, the Government needs to
continue structural adjustments, including
fiscal consolidation and finance sector and

trade reforms. The medium-term strategy for
fiscal consolidation includes eliminating
distortionary taxes, improving tax administration, restructuring public debt, expanding
public enterprise reform, and implementing
a phased reduction in defense- and securityrelated expenditures. In view of the softening
export prices and increased competition from
regional producers, it is imperative to reorient
the existing productive structure toward
higher value-added sectors and to increase
productivity levels in the economy.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB’s new operational
strategy for Sri Lanka was finalized in March
1999. The strategy aims to assist the country’s
poverty reduction efforts through sustainable
growth by supporting (i) policy and institutional
reforms to promote private sector growth and
improve public sector efficiency; (ii) human
development to address the gap in marketable
skills and thereby improve employment and
income levels; (iii) enhancement of the country's
infrastructure through public and private investments; (iv) preservation of the country's natural resource base; and (v) measures to mitigate
the social and environmental impacts of the
transition to a higher growth path.

Policy dialogue: Policy dialogue continued
to focus on policy and institutional reforms to
improve public sector efficiency and promote
private sector growth. ADB provided technical
assistance to improve the country's public
expenditure management systems for more
efficient and effective public service. In the road
subsector, ADB's dialogue led to introducing
new legislation for effective regulation of roads,
formulating a reform program to improve road
subsector management efficiency, developing
anew approach to fund road maintenance, and
promoting private sector contractors.

In agriculture, ongoing policy and institutional reforms included the plantation
privatization programs and private sector participation in fishery harbor management and
services. In natural resources, policy dialogue
focused on legal and institutional reforms to
improve the investment environment for privateRegional and Country Highlights

water supply and sanitation, the Government,
with ADB's assistance, is working to establish
a regulatory framework for possible private
sector participation in urban water supply and
sanitation. Dialogue with the Government also
continued in public enterprise reform and
restructuring, privatization, and labor and capital market reforms.

Loans and technical assistance: Three
public sector loans amounting to $148.8 million were approved during the year in agriculture and natural resources ($40 million),
transport ($90 million), and social infrastructure ($18.8 million). A private sector loan of
$35 million was also approved for the
transport sector. Twelve technical assistance
grants amounting to $7.9 million were
approved.

Project implementation: Since becoming a
member in 1966, Sri Lanka has received a total
of 92 loans, of which 25 were still active at the
end of 1999. Contract awards during the year
amounted to $89.2 million, bringing the cumulative total to $1.7 billion. The contract award
ratio for 1999 was 13.7 percent. Disbursements
during the year amounted to $103.2 million,
with cumulative disbursements reaching
$1.6 billion. The disbursement ratio for 1999
was 17.9 percent.

However, there are continued delays in
project implementation resulting from timeconsuming contracting, cumbersome procurement rules and procedures, and noncompliance
with some major financial loan covenants. Poor
performance has also been observed in respect
of recruiting consultants. Another major delay
has been identified in setting up PMUs.

All ongoing loans were rated satisfactory
in both implementation progress and achievement of development objectives, except for
two loans in the power and transport sectors.
Project implementation problems in these
sectors continued to be characterized by
excessive delays in procurement and implementation decisions.

To resolve these problems, the Sri Lanka
Resident Mission conducted monthly portfolio
performance review meetings with project
directors and officials of line ministries and
effective policy dialogue with the Government,
with particular emphasis on these two loans.
The progress of the action plan for improving
project implementation in Sri Lanka, which was
developed with ADB's assistance in 1997, was
monitored and found to be effective during the
last two years.

Delays in procurement were addressed by
the Procurement Support Bureau, which was
established by the Government in 1998 with the
assistance of ADB in close consultation withANNUAL REPORT 1999

investigate the potential and recommend procedural reform for improving procurement
practices and for training procurement staff.

The Pacific

Nineteen ninety-nine was a year of improved
economic performance and notable political
developments in the Pacific DMCs. Real GDP
increased by a weighted average of 4.4 percent,
compared with 1.2 percent in 1998 and negative 3.2 percent in 1997. Economic growth rates
were faster in 9 of the 12 countries. The average
inflation rate for the Pacific DMCs rose to
9.9 percent, compared with 8.1 percent in 1998,
largely because of an increase in Papua New
Guinea's rate after substantial currency devaluation. The overall balance-of-payments position improved for most countries, and fiscal and
monetary policy settings generally were consistent with the maintenance of macroeconomic
stability, except in Papua New Guinea during
the first half of the year. There were changes
of government in Cook Islands, Fiji Islands,
Marshall Islands, Federated States of
Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, and
Vanuatu, with most of the new administrations

The Pacific Human Development Report
1999 presented evidence of significant human
development in the Pacific DMCs during the
1990s, but Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands,
and Vanuatu in particular remained low on the
human development index scale and exhibited
significant poverty as measured by the human
poverty index. For all Pacific DMCs, small size,
remoteness, geographic fragmentation and
dispersion, and economic vulnerability
continued to impose severe development constraints. Vulnerability to natural disasters
remained an unpredictable and potentially devastating variable affecting development outcomes.
Nonetheless, in most cases, governments old and
new showed commitment to improving the economic policy and governance environments—
variables that they could influence.

An ADB review of reform programs in
Pacific DMCs concluded that Samoa continues
to demonstrate strong local ownership of a
clearly focused and appropriately sequenced set
of reforms, and has made major progress in
finance sector reform and corporatization and
privatization of SOEs. There has been strong
bipartisan ownership and public support for the
reform program in Vanuatu, where a new legislative framework for good governance was
introduced and finance sector reforms were
made. A determined Solomon Islands Government

continues to take the country along the reform
path despite huge obstacles, consolidating
improvements in public financial management.
In Cook Islands, Marshall Islands, and Federated States of Micronesia, where the reform programs were the earliest supported by ADB,
substantial achievements were made, particularly in the area of fiscal strengthening. In 1999,
signs emerged that commitment to reform was
weakening in these three countries, but new
administrations indicated their intention to
revitalize the process. In Papua New Guinea
also, the new Government has committed itself
to restoring macroeconomic stability and economic, public sector, and governance reforms. The
new Government of the Fiji Islands sought to
address the problems of weak employment growth
and (especially urban) poverty by encouraging
private sector-led, broad-based economic growth.
In Nauru, however, the reform program stalled
under a new administration.

The year 1999 also saw ADB move into
selective investments in physical infrastructure,
health, and education. These investments are
aimed at complementing ADB support for
reform programs by improving the enabling
environment for private sector development.
ADB also began regional technical assistance
on performance benchmarking for water and
power utilities, and initiated assessing the status of finance sector development in selected
Pacific DMCs, with the aim of formulating a
strategy for building sustainable financial systems appropriate to the circumstances of small
island economies. In addition, ADB began
regionwide assistance to establish sound policies and management plans for coral reef ecosystems, and strengthen the capacity of Pacific
DMCs in negotiating an appropriate and fair
international fisheries agreement for conserving and managing the Pacific tuna resource.

Cook Islands

Economic performance

Real GDP grew by 2.8 percent in 1999. The key
tourism subsector expanded as Australians,
Canadians, and New Zealanders took advantage

of improved air services. Black pearl production continued to grow, and the commercial
agriculture sector production recovered from
the 1997-1998 drought-affected levels.
Construction activity remained subdued. The
inflation rate rose to 1.4 percent from 0.8 percent in 1998. The merchandise trade deficit
was 45.5 percent of GDP in 1999, and continued to be substantially offset by tourism
receipts, official transfers, and private remittances. A current account deficit of 8.0 percent of GDP was recorded.

Domestic policies: Government finances
strengthened in FY1998/99 (ending 30 June),
with an operating surplus of New Zealand dollar
(NZ$)2.5 million and an overall surplus of
NZ$3.4 million. The debt service burden eased
due to the September 1998 restructuring of
external debt that now stands at 81 percent of
GDP. Interest payments were, however, a
modest 12 percent of tax revenue. The principal
policy issue is whether, in the context of
completing the Economic Restructuring
Program, these fiscal gains can be consolidated
and the allocative efficiency of public
expenditure improved after a year characterized
by political instability in the latter half and
continued migration to New Zealand. The new
Government committed itself to economic,
public sector, and governance reforms,
including improvements in the private sector
enabling environment.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's strategy for the
Cook Islands is to continue support for the reform process as it moves into a phase of consolidation. At the same time, ADB's assistance
will aim to facilitate an enabling environment
for private sector growth in sectors with strong
potential, such as tourism and marine resource
development. In the medium term, ADB will help
address emerging poverty in isolated outer
island communities.

Policy dialogue: Fiscal discipline, accountability through proper reporting and auditing,
sound management of debt, and private sector
development are issues that will remain high
on the policy agenda. A priority objective is toANNUAL REPORT 1999

Project implementation: Since becoming a
member in 1976, the Cook Islands has received
a total of 11 loans, of which 3 were still active
at the end of 1999. Contract awards for the year
amounted to about $1.0 million, bringing the
cumulative total to $23.9 million. The contract
award ratio for 1999 was 16 percent. Disbursements amounted to $860,000 for the year, with

cumulative disbursements standing at
$21.8 million. The disbursement ratio for 1999
was 32.7 percent. Project implementation was
affected by a lack of qualified staff and
weaknesses in management and accounting
systems. Implementation of the three ongoing
loans was satisfactory. The Cook Islands
strictly complied with the submission of
audited project accounts and financial
statements for the loans, partly because of
the continuous follow-up by ADB headquarters and the South Pacific Regional Mission.

Fiji Islands

Economic performance

After falling by a cumulative 3.0 percent in
1997-1998, real GDP increased by an estimated
7.8 percent in 1999. The economic rebound
largely reflected the recovery of the sugar
industry from the effects of a prolonged drought
and was supported by growth in tourism,
clothing, gold, and footwear. Simultaneous
with the recovery in aggregate production in
1999, the inflation rate dropped to an endof-year rate of zero percent because of falling
prices for domestically produced foods,
reduced import duties, and low inflation
among major trading partners. The current
account surplus was equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP, with export revenue rising from
all major sources. The capital account balance
was also in surplus, and foreign reserves
covered almost five months of imports of
goods and nonfactor services.

Domestic policies: The Government's fiscal position in 1999 was sound, with a budget
deficit of 1.2 percent of GDP and a public debt
reaching 39.5 percent of GDP. Monetary policy
was accommodative, and commercial bank
lending rates dropped. However, private investment remained subdued, partly reflecting
unresolved land tenure and structural adjustment issues in the sugar industry. Employment
growth was slow. A new Government elected
in May was seeking to address these problems
by reorienting economic policy toward poverty
reduction and growth with equity.Regional and Country Highlights

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's operational strategy for the Fiji Islands focuses on assisting the
Government in its ongoing efforts to stimulate
growth by encouraging private investment and
export-oriented activities through (i) expanding
and diversifying the economy to provide jobs
and decrease its vulnerability to volatile
export markets; (ii) enhancing the pace of the
reforms, particularly for improved delivery 0
public sector services; (iii) further implementing the long-term commitment of the
Government to promote private sector-led
growth, especially through corporatization
and commercialization, capital marke
development, and targeted public sector investment for infrastructure development; and
(iv) addressing environmental and natura
resource management concerns.

Policy dialogue: In 1999, policy dialogue
focused on enterprise reforms, capital marke
development, cost recovery, and operation and
maintenance in the road subsector. The
economic and sector work was expanded to
include the preparation of an economic repor'
identifying medium-term prospects and
challenges.

a member in 1970, the Fiji Islands has
received a total of 13 loans, of which one was
still active at the end of 1999. Contract awards
for the year amounted to about $6.3 million,
bringing the cumulative total to $115.5 million. The contract award ratio for 1999 was
15.8 percent. Disbursements for the year
totaled $1.6 million, with cumulative
disbursements standing at $114.6 million. The
disbursement ratio for 1999 was 4.0 percent.
One loan was closed in the first quarter of
the year, leaving only one ongoing loan, the
Third Road Upgrading (Sector) Project.

Overall, project implementation was
slow. A few major components were behind
implementation targets primarily because of
(i) a delay in recruiting consultants for technical support, (ii) unforeseen prolonged wet
weather, (iii) insufficient resources for force
accounting works, and (iv) staff constraints
and ineffective project management. These
problems were addressed during project review missions, and efforts were already under
way for improvement.

Kiribati
Economic performance

The economic growth rate in Kiribati in 1999
was estimated between | and 2 percent, reflecting some increased activity in the public sector,
which accounts for about three quarters of GDP.
Real GNP was expected to fall as fishing license
fees fell from the unusually high level of 1998.
The inflation rate was 2 percent in 1999, in line
with rates in the major trading partners. The
external position remained fundamentally
sound, despite the substantial drop in fishing
license fees and a consequent shift of the current account balance into a deficit of 20 percent of GDP. The capital account was in surplus
and gross official reserves, which included the
assets of the $400 million Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund, were sufficient for more than
five years of imports of goods and services.

Domestic policies: The Medium-Term
Strategy adopted in late 1997 aims to reduce
the size of core government, implement public
enterprise reform, facilitate private sector
development, and encourage foreign investment. Progress in implementation was slow,
however, with the 1999 budget providing for
a further increase in the number of civil servants. Supplementary appropriations toward
the end of 1999 raised the level of recurrent
government spending to 79 percent of GDP
and increased concerns over the sustainability
of the fiscal policy framework.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's operational strategy for Kiribati seeks to promote sustainable
growth and improvements in the living
standards of the country’s people. The focus of
ADB's operations is on three main areas:
(i) strengthening policy and public sector
reforms, with emphasis on improving
government resource efficiency and on
restructuring/reforming public enterprises;
(ii) developing social infrastructure; and
(iii) promoting private sector activities,
including outer island development.

Policy dialogue: With ADB assistance, a
comprehensive program has been prepared for
infrastructure improvements in water supply,
sewerage, and solid waste management. Institutional reforms, designed to enhance the
effectiveness and efficiency in operation and
maintenance of public utilities, have also been
identified. ADB's policy dialogue with the Government during the year included restructuring the Public Utilities Board; sustainability of
operations in the utilities subsector, including
cost recovery, and operation and maintenance;
and conserving water and protecting the environment. Kiribati looked to the consultative
group process to help implement its development strategy more proactively.

Loans and technical assistance: No loans
were approved in 1999. One advisory technical
assistance grant for $861,000 was approved for the
second phase of strengthening institutional
capacity for financial and economic management.

Marshall Islands

Economic performance

The level of economic activity in the Marshall
Islands recovered in 1999 following three years
of recession. The downturn was largely attributed to public service downsizing under
the Policy Reform Program and poor performance in agriculture and fisheries. Real GDP
rose by about 0.5 percent in 1999, reflecting
the impact of aid-funded roadworks, private
sector construction of a tuna loining factory,
and onshore spending by crews of an expanding foreign purse seiner fleet. The inflation
rate was | percent. The external position improved because of a rise in fishing license fees
and receipt of bilateral external grants.

Domestic policies: Although public
finances have been strengthened as a result
of public service downsizing, concerns remained over the quality of fiscal policy formulation and implementation. The 1999
budget was passed one month into the fiscal
year without revised estimates of budget outcomes in the previous year. The lowering of
the general import duty from 12 to 5 percent
and an increase in the copra subsidy were announced in March 1999, apparently without
consideration of the budget implications. The
deficit on General Fund accounts in 1999
surged from 1 to 9 percent of GDP, with
unbudgeted bilateral grant funds providing
the necessary budget support.

 

ADB operations

Operational strategy: The main objective of
ADB's operational strategy for the Marshall
Islands is to help the Government achieve a
sustainable and self-reliant economy. ADB's
assistance is aimed at economic and financial
reforms; improving fiscal management capability; and supporting essential services such as
education, health, and water supply.

Policy dialogue: The principal areas of
ADB's policy dialogue with the Government
remained focused on enhancing economic and
financial management and promoting fiscal
responsibility. It specifically focused on eliminating macroeconomic constraints to private

member in 1990, the Marshall Islands has
received eight loans, of which five were still
active at the end of 1999, including one which
has been declared effective in December 1999.
Contract awards for the year amounted to
$3.0 million, bringing the cumulative total to
$32.5 million. The contract award ratio was
18.6 percent for the year. Disbursements
totaled $3.9 million for the year, with cumulative disbursements standing at $30.1 million. The disbursement ratio for 1999 was
18.2 percent. Project implementation was
streamlined to speed up project completion
and ensure anticipated development impact
of the loan portfolio.

In general, implementation for three ongoing project loans experienced delays mainly
because of (i) problems associated with land
lease agreements, (ii) weakness in project
implementation capacity, (iii) lack of coordination among implementing agencies, and
(iv) procurement delays. The loan for the Public Sector Reform Program also experienced
delays in meeting the conditions for release of
the third tranche, extending the loan closing
date to June 2000.

Federated States of Micronesia

Economic performance

The real GDP of the Federated States of
Micronesia rose by an estimated 0.3 percent in
FY1998/99 (ending 30 September), reflecting

growth in private sector activity in Chuuk
State. No data were available on the inflation rate, but it is expected to have tracked
the US rate of 2.6 percent. Data limitations also
prevented an analysis of the external accounts.
However, the external debt level continued to
decline, reaching 38 percent of GDP, compared
with a high of 66 percent in 1993. The debt
service ratio was estimated at 25 percent of
export earnings.

Domestic policies: The implementation of
the Public Sector Reform Program, adopted in
1997, resulted in a substantial strengthening
of national and state government finances,
primarily through reduction in the size and
operating costs of public services. Government
expenditure still remained high at about
70 percent of GDP, thereby necessitating
public service reform as opposed to simple
downsizing, effective public enterprise
reform, and an improved private sector policy
environment.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's strategy for the
Federated States of Micronesia focuses on the
need to shift the economy from one that is
overly controlled by the public sector to an
economy that is increasingly sustained by an
open and competitive private sector. Private sector development was identified as the main goal

of economic strategies of the Federated States
of Micronesia at the second national economic
summit held in September 1999.

Policy dialogue: Policy reform and dialogue
continued to be the major focus of ADB's program of assistance to the country. The core of
the dialogue was a move from emphasizing
fiscal and macroeconomic stability and management to stimulating private sector investment and improving performance and
prioritization of the public sector, with a focus on providing better basic social services
delivery. ADB helped the Federated States of
Micronesia examine and discuss land, labor,
and capital resource market policies, in
addition to key sector policies such as fisheries, an important component of future
overall development policy. ADB will convene
the fourth Consultative Group meeting of the
country's funding agencies in 2000 to discuss
the progress of reform and future economic
strategy.

Loans and technical assistance: No loans
were approved during the year. Five technical
assistance grants amounting to $1.3 million
were approved.

Project implementation: Since becoming a
member in 1990, the Federated States of
Micronesia has received three loans; one loan
was closed during the year. Contract awards
for the year amounted to $4.6 million, bringing
the cumulative total to $23.8 million. The contract award ratio for 1999 was 10.2 percent. Disbursements totaled $4.9 million for the year,

The program loan helped in restructuring and
redirecting the economy and was assessed as
generally successful. On the other hand,
implementation of the project loans (particularly Fisheries Development) suffered from
delays, requiring the loan closing date to be
extended by one year. The good performance
in disbursement and the disbursement ratio
was due to the final release of the second
tranche from the program loan.

Nauru

Economic performance

No official national accounts data for 1999 are
available, but real GDP was likely to have
increased in FY1998/99 (ending 30 June). Real
government expenditure rose 15 percent,

compared with 1997-1998 and the volume of
phosphate exports rose 38 percent. The
Japanese- funded construction of Ainabare boat
harbor began and fisheries production for the
domestic market increased. The inflation rate
rose to 6.7 percent in 1998-1999 because of
increased import duties and utility charges. No
recent trade data are available, but external debt
stood at the end of March 1999 at $84 million—
more than double the total GDP.

Domestic policies: About 28 percent of the
public sector workforce was retrenched in 1999
to move toward a sustainable fiscal position.
However, the overall budget deficit increased
from the 1997-1998 level. Improving fiscal
governance is vital. The revival of the banking
subsector and establishment of the true value
and improved management of the assets of the
Nauru Phosphate Royalty Trust also remained
fundamental challenges.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: The major thrust of ADB's
operational strategy is to continue support for
Nauru in achieving long-term economic and
financial sustainability through a reform
program that includes (i) improved fiscal
management, (ii) better public debt and trust
fund management, (iii) public sector reforms,
and (iv) restructuring of the economy. To reduce
dependence on phosphate mining and move
toward a more balanced real economy, ADB's
assistance is directed toward diversifying and
developing the private sector by promoting
entrepreneurship and small business growth.
The strategy should ensure future stability of
income and living standards at levels
sustainable by the economy without distortion
through government subsidies.

Policy dialogue: In terms of economic and
financial management, the major effort is to
achieve all-around economic and fiscal discipline, improve returns from trust fund operations, create an enabling environment for
private sector business development, and
sustain the Government's commitment to the
reform process.

Loans and technical assistance: No loans
were approved during the year. Two advisory

technical assistance grants of $244,000 were
approved for social awareness and transitional
requirements for the reform program and
support for Y2K compliance.

Project implementation: Since becoming a
member in 1991, Nauru has had one program
loan, which became effective in February 1999,
also when the first tranche was released. Contracts awarded in 1999 amounted to $2.3 million. Disbursements for the year totaled
$2.3 million.

Significant progress was made initially in
implementing the policy and reform matrix
to meet the conditions for releasing the second tranche of the Fiscal and Financial
Reform Program. With the change of government in June 1999, the reform momentum was
lost. However, areas that could derail the
reform program were discussed with the
Government, and it was agreed that
fundamental changes need to be effected.

Papua New Guinea

Economic performance

Papua New Guinea recorded an estimated real
GDP growth rate of 3.9 percent in 1999, despite
suffering the effects of economic mismanagement by an administration that lost office in
July. The growth resulted from improved
commodity prices and increased export
volumes. The inflation rate accelerated to
16 percent, primarily as a result of a 26 percent currency depreciation. Growth in
merchandise exports contributed to an
improved current account balance, but the
external reserve position remained precarious
throughout the year, with import cover of only
one month.

Domestic policies: After a long period of
political instability, the new reform-minded
Government promised to restore and sustain
macroeconomic stability, revitalize the
economic reform process, revive business
confidence, and improve governance, thereby
receiving strong support in its endeavors from
ADB. Fiscal policy was tightened in the August
1999 supplementary budget, which aimed atRegional and Country Highlights

137

 

reducing the budget deficit to 1.6 percent of
GDP and was endorsed by IMF. The supplementary budget provided for cuts to the
national Government's development expenditure and revenue-raising increases in
gaming taxes, log export taxes, and excises
on petrol, alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and
luxury motor vehicles.

The interest withholding tax on mining
and petroleum companies introduced in the
original budget was subsequently removed.
These measures generated a surplus in the
second half of 1999, leaving a deficit of
1.6 percent of GDP for the whole year, funded
by external borrowing. Fiscal tightening
facilitated a refocusing of monetary policy on
the credible pursuit of the objectives of price
and exchange rate stability. Monetary policy
was tightened by raising the Minimum Liquid
Assets ratio to 25 percent.

 

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's operational strategy for Papua New Guinea focuses on improved
governance, private sector development, and
improved social indicators. At the Government's
request, ADB is taking a lead role in assisting
the Government design and implement a
program of public sector reform and improve
performance; a key element is support for
strengthening public sector financial manage

ment. The generation of long-term, incomeearning opportunities is another key concern
to be addressed through private sector development. ADB will help improve sector
policy and institutional frameworks, enhance
factor productivity, and improve market access by selected infrastructure investments,
especially in the transport sector. The third
broad strategic concern is the critical need
to improve the dismal social indicators; the
emphasis is on rural areas, especially on improving the status of women.

Policy dialogue: The focus of policy dialogue was on the underlying development management weaknesses that hamper effective
planning and management throughout the
economy. ADB concentrated on helping the
Government reform the public sector financial
management systems, with a view to supporting performance-oriented management, and
assisting in the refinement of the management
systems themselves. Improving the efficiency
of service delivery (by contracting out for
services) was the core of dialogue in agriculture and general skills development while
institutional strengthening and a focus on
sustainability have dominated discussions on
commercial fisheries. The need for rational,
evidence-based decision making has underlain
dialogue in the transport sector.

Loans and technical assistance: In 1999,
ADB approved three loans amounting to
$108.8 million for financial management
($25.8 million), employment-oriented skills
development ($20 million), and road maintenance and upgrading ($63 million) projects.
In addition, seven technical assistance grants
totaling $3.6 million were approved, of which
three were advisory in nature. The remaining
four were for project preparation for maritime navigation aids, provincial towns water
supply and sanitation, governance and public sector reform, and microfinance and employment creation.

Project implementation: Since becoming a
member in 1971, Papua New Guinea has
received a total of 50 loans, of which 12 loans
were still active at the end of 1999. Contract
awards for the year amounted to $34.6 million,
bringing the cumulative total to $501.8 million.
The contract award ratio was 21.6 percent. Disbursements totaled $35.1 million for the year
and cumulative disbursements totaled
$507.8 million.

Three new loans for three projects were
declared effective during the year, bringing the
number of effective loans to 12 for 10 projects.
Implementation of most projects suffered
from delays due to shortages in counterpart
funds, inexperienced personnel, cumbersome
administrative procedures, land acquisition difficulties, and law and order problems. ADB,
in collaboration with the Government, undertook remedial measures to resolve these

problems to progressively improve performance. Toward the end of the first half of
1999, improved implementation progress was
visible and performance of all projects was rated
satisfactory.

Samoa

Economic performance

Samoa's real GDP increased by 4.0 percent in
1999. This growth was led by the fishing,
commerce, and construction subsectors and
supported by the expansion in the public
administration subsectors. The average
annual inflation rate fell to 0.3 percent,
reflecting a drop in local food prices, low
inflation rates in the major sources 0
imports, and tariff reductions. Growth in
private sector imports largely accounted for
a widening of the merchandise trade and
current account deficits. The capital accoun
surplus increased because of a rise in externa
grants and loans, and the overall balance o
payments recorded a surplus. Official foreign
exchange reserves were sufficient for
6.3 months of import cover, just over the
policy target of six months. The nomina
exchange rate remained stable, while the
Government's external debt fell to 60 percent
of GDP. External debt service absorbed about
4 percent of net income from exports o
goods, services, and private remittances.
Domestic policies: Samoa continues to lead
the Pacific subregion in its economic and reform
management. The Government continued to
demonstrate its commitment to and regional
leadership in economic reform through
corporatizing and privatizing several public
enterprises, and preparing the Partnership for
a Prosperous Society: A Statement of Economic
Strategy 2000-2001. In the year ending 30 June
1999, an overall budget surplus of 0.5 percent
of GDP was recorded, leaving room for an
expansion of credit to the private sector while
keeping growth in the broad money supply to
a modest rate of 10 percent. In FY1999/2000
(ending 30 June), an overall budget deficit of
5.1 percent of GDP was expected, reflectingRegional and Country Highlights

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's strategy for Samoa
is to support the Government's economic reform
program, which aims to transform the economy
to become more enterprise-based and competitively structured. ADB will continue to support

Policy dialogue: ADB played a catalytic role
in strengthening the Government's capacity in
macroeconomic management and policy formulation. Through policy dialogue and related
technical assistance, ADB continued to support
and encourage the Government in promoting
private sector-led growth, and implementing its
privatization and corporatization program.
ADB's policy dialogue in Samoa also continued
to promote greater financial and operational
autonomy for SOEs.

Loans and technical assistance: No loans
were approved during the year. ADB approved
five technical assistance grants amounting to
$1.3 million, of which three were advisory.

Project implementation: Since becoming a
member in 1966, Samoa has received 26 loans,
of which one program loan is still active at the
end of 1999. No contract awards or disbursements were made in 1999.

Only the Financial Sector Program loan
was ongoing. Substantial implementation
progress was made during the year, and the
overall program was generally on track. The
Government remained committed to the
reform program.

Solomon Islands

Economic performance

Economic activity in Solomon Islands was
disrupted in 1999 by the civil conflict on
Guadalcanal. Real GDP was estimated to have
grown by about 1 percent instead of the
2-3 percent forecast at the beginning of the
year. Production of logs and fish increased;
but palm oil, gold, cocoa, and coconut production were curtailed as a result of the civil
conflict. The size of the public service was
reduced by 5 percent as part of the ongoing
Policy and Structural Reform Program. The
inflation rate dropped from 12.3 percent in
1998 to around 8 percent, with prices of
locally grown food rising, and the currency
depreciating 4.2 percent against the US dollar.

stabilization and economic reform were
crucial to maintaining external reserves at
around 3.5 months of import cover. The
Government's external debt increased to
about $116 million as a result of the disbursement of an ADB loan.

Domestic policies: The progress made
during 1998 and early 1999 in rehabilitating
government finances was threatened by the
impact of the civil conflict on revenue and
expenditure. However, the Government
remained committed to maintaining fiscal
discipline and improving allocative efficiency.
Monetary policy was tight throughout the
year. The Government, attempting to create
a stable macroeconomic environment and
restore investor confidence within its
medium-term development strategy, faced the
additional problem of addressing the causes
of the civil conflict.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: A major part of ADB's
operational strategy for Solomon Islands is to
strengthen central agency capabilities in economic policy formulation, planning, and economic management, and to facilitate legislative
reforms that will underpin the Government's
reform agenda. A longer-term objective is poverty reduction, based on expanding access to
basic social services, strengthening local

government capacities, and improving population policy and services. Among the productive
sectors, special attention will be given to marine
resource development where there is untapped
potential for sustainable livelihood and income
generation.

Policy dialogue: The areas for continuing
policy dialogue are public expenditure management, civil service reform, privatization, and
local government capacity building. Continued
progress is vital in meeting the agreed-upon
objectives of expanding basic services to reach
outer island communities where poverty is
concentrated .

Loans and technical assistance: No loans
were approved in 1999. Seven technical
assistance grants amounting to $1.14 million
were approved, of which four were advisory.

Project implementation: Since becoming
a member in 1973, Solomon Islands has received a total of 15 loans, of which 2 were
still active at the end of 1999. Contract awards
for the year amounted to $900,000, bringing
the cumulative total to $53.8 million. The
contract award ratio for 1999 was 8 percent.
Disbursements for the year amounted to
$325,000, with cumulative disbursements
standing at $53.6 million. The disbursement
ratio for 1999 was 2.8 percent.

The implementation progress of the two
ongoing loans was satisfactory.

Tonga

Economic performance

The Tongan economy recovered in FY1997/98
(ending 30 June) from three years of recession,
achieving a real GDP growth of 0.1 percent. Real
GDP increased by 2.2 percent in FY1998/99 as
a result of increased activity in the services
subsector. The primary and secondary sectors
experienced negative performances. This was
due to a downturn in international demand for
squash, vanilla, and fish; the impact of the
drought on crop production; and the destruction
of crops and other damages caused by a cyclone
at the end of 1998.

The inflation rate edged up to 4.4 percent
because of currency devaluation and the effects
of drought on domestic food prices in early
1999. The merchandise trade deficit decreased
in FY1998/99 as imports increased by $4 million,
while exports increased by $5.2 million, compared with the FY1997/98 levels. The current
account deficit decreased further because of an
improved services account balance; and with
the capital account in surplus, gross foreign
reserves rose to an equivalent of four months
of imports.

Domestic policies: Official data showed an
overall budget surplus of 1 percent of GDP in
FY1998/99, but this involved expenditure on
goods and services and development projects
that was below original budget estimates,
while the nominal wage bill grew. The
Government's underlying fiscal capacity, as
measured by the current balance, remained
weak. Monetary policy remained tight, but
was constrained by the weakness of the
Reserve Bank's balance sheet, emphasizing
the importance of improved macroeconomic
policy coordination.

ADB operations

Government's development strategy, ADB
continued to focus on supporting private sector development and reducing the role of the
Government in business activities. ADB's role

encouraged the Government to develop a consensus for reform in late 1999; the Government and ADB agreed to prepare a detailed
policy agenda that would form the basis for
future lending.

Loans and technical assistance: No loans
or technical assistance grants were approved
in 1999.

Project implementation: Since becoming a
member in 1972, Tonga has received a total of
13 loans, of which 3 were still active at the end
of 1999. One loan was terminated in 1999.
Contract awards for the year amounted to
about $1.8 million, bringing the cumulative
total to $47.0 million. Disbursements
amounted to $2.2 million for the year, with
cumulative disbursements standing at
$38.0 million. The disbursement ratio for
1999 was 37.5 percent.

Tuvalu

Economic performance

Real GDP grew by an estimated 3.0 percent in
1999, largely because of expansion in the public administration and construction subsectors.
The inflation rate rose to 7 percent, reflecting
higher prices in the transport and miscellaneous
categories of CPI. With merchandise exports
falling and finance reaching less than 5 percent of imports, continued reliance was placed
on fishing and telecommunications license
fees, remittances from overseas workers,
official transfers, and investment income from
overseas assets to cover the trade deficit. Attempts were still being made to lease Tuvalu's
Internet domain address to a foreign company. There were no external debt service
requirements.

Domestic policies: The Government
adopted a mildly expansionary fiscal policy
stance in 1999, increasing expenditure on
health and outer island development. The
expansion was consistent with the long
standing commitment to maintain the real
value per capita of the Tuvalu Trust Fund. Use
of the Australian dollar precluded an independent monetary policy. Credit was provided
to the small private sector by the National
Bank of Tuvalu.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's strategy for Tuvalu
aims to promote sustainable economic and
social development through (i) human development; (ii) reforming the public sector, including corporatizing government businesses;
(ili) enhancing private sector development; and
(iv) improving the economic conditions of the
outer islands. Assisting the Government in
coordinating with funding agencies is also an
important task of ADB.

Policy dialogue: Discussions continued to
center on economic management, reforming the
public sector, developing the outer islands, and
coordinating with funding agencies.

Loans and technical assistance: ADB's
first loan to Tuvalu of $4 million was approved
in July 1999 for the Island Development
Program. One advisory technical assistance
grant of $600,000 was approved for its
implementation.

Project implementation: The Island Development Program loan became effective in
November. The contract awards and disbursements for the year were $2.8 million. The contract award ratio was 68.5 percent and the
disbursement ratio was 70.9 percent for 1999.

Vanuatu

Economic performance

Vanuatu's real GDP fell by 2.0 percent in 1999
despite a 7.6 percent growth in secondary sector
production resulting from a substantial increase
in aid-funded construction. Primary sector
output declined by 9.3 percent, with agricultural production being adversely affected by a
cyclone in February. The services subsector
contracted by 1.2 percent, as government and
tourism-related services both declined.Regional and Country Highlights

143

 

Inflation was in the 2-3 percent range.
Merchandise exports fell from the 1998 levels,
but no balance-of-payments pressure was
evident because imports declined in line with
the downturn in economic activity. The
current account deficit remained at 8 percent
of GDP, official foreign reserves were equivalent to 6.5 months of imports, and exchange
rate movements maintained Vanuatu's international competitiveness.

Domestic policies: Following an overall
budget deficit of 10.3 percent of GDP in 1998,
the fiscal position improved in 1999 with a
budget deficit of 1.2 percent of GDP as a result
of lower level of public expenditure. Continued
efforts to maintain aggregate fiscal discipline
needed to be matched by improved allocative
efficiency. Investor confidence was given a
boost with the amendment of the Foreign
Investment Act in June 1999, which made it less
restrictive of foreign investment. However,
confidence was dented in late November by
political instability. Some of the reform
momentum was lost with the change in
government.

 

ADB operations

Operational strategy: Since February 1997, ADB
has actively supported the Comprehensive
Reform Program (CRP) formulation and
implementation process through a program

loan and complementary technical assistance,
recognizing that limited institutional capacity
and technical/professional skills constitute a
major constraint. The strategic thrust of ADB's
operations in Vanuatu in 1999, and over the
medium term, is gradually to shift the emphasis
of its technical assistance support to enhance
local service delivery, provide closer monitoring,
pay attention to the social impact of reform,
and continue to implement broader economic
and public sector reforms.

Policy dialogue: In 1999, policy dialogue
focused on identifying requirements to ensure
sustainability of both economic and public
sector reforms. In this connection, one of the
key themes of ADB's policy support program
continues to be institutional strengthening
and capacity building in selected agencies. To
ensure that the reform process is sustainable
and credible within the wider community, ADB
also focused more intensively on assisting to
improve public service delivery at the local level,
assessing the social impact of reforms, and
identifying social sector issues of priority
concern. ADB is also actively involved in
technical assistance for CRP coordination to
ensure that the various elements of economic
and public sector reforms, now being supported
by several funding agencies, remain part of a
cohesive framework.

the year. Seven technical assistance grants
amounting to $2 million were approved, of
which five are advisory and two are project
preparatory.

Project implementation: Since becoming a
member in 1981, Vanuatu has received a total
of nine loans, of which three were still active
at the end of 1999. Contract awards for the
year amounted to about $8.0 million, bringing the cumulative total to $36.1 million. The

contract award ratio for 1999 was 41.3 percent.
Disbursements totaled $6.4 million for the year,
with cumulative disbursements standing at
$35.1 million. The disbursement ratio for the
year was 29.6 percent.

The Urban Infrastructure Project was rated
partly satisfactory. Strong cooperative efforts
by ADB's South Pacific Regional Mission and
the Government to resolve the situation got the
Project back on track.Corporate Planning
and Support Activities

ADB planning process

DB defines its strategic objectives,

most notably its poverty reduction

strategy, through its planning pro
cess. Its corporate planning process
is adaptive to changing country circumstances.
It addresses the increasing scope of development assistance services needed and takes
account of its own organizational capacity to
deliver those services.

The organization-wide planning process is
aimed at systematically establishing long-term,
medium-term, and annual business objectives
for ADB; setting overall and country-specific
operational priorities; and achieving agreement
both within ADB and with client developing
member countries (DMCs) on the milestones
and road maps to follow in implementing programs. While ADB's vision, strategic development objectives, and corporate agenda are set
out in its Long-Term Strategic Framework,
which will be updated in 2000 to cover the
period 2001-2015, operations are driven by
individual country operational strategies and
laid out in country assistance plans (CAPs) that
are formulated for rolling three-year periods.
As a group, these country-based plans define

ADB's three-year rolling work program which,
in turn, shapes the annual administrative
budget. The corporate planning process feeds
on continuous assessments of lessons learned
from immediate and relevant country experiences. The process also directly guides the
planning of operational support activities within
ADB that play a critical role in strengthening
internal capacity and competence.

A strategic reorientation

ADB undertook a fundamental strategic reorientation in 1999 with the adoption of poverty
reduction as its overarching objective. With the
setbacks caused by the Asian financial crisis,
there was greater urgency for this refocusing.
ADB uses its country-based corporate planning
process not only to develop immediate and
relevant responses tailored to individual country circumstances, but also to effectively incorporate its intensified attack on poverty.

A comprehensive poverty reduction strategy, which was approved by the Board of
Directors in late 1999, provides the intellectual
and long-term framework for ADB's strategic
reorientation. To support this thrust, work began on new and broad-based operational strategies for expanded ADB roles in private sector
development, good governance, and regional
cooperation. These operational strategies will
be fully defined in the context of each DMC's
development priorities and constraints. Accordingly, the country-specific ADB assistance plans
developed in 1999 for the period 2000-2002 will
be updated in close consultation with government planning and sectoral ministries, and also
with the direct participation of beneficiary
groups and nongovernment organizations
(NGOs). The CAPs set out how ADB will support policy reform, good governance, and

capacity building; regional and subregional
cooperation; the creation and strengthening of
productive capacity and social infrastructure;
and public services to be provided through the
public and private sectors in each DMC. The
CAPs, posted on ADB's web site, include the
planned pipeline of ADB's loan and technical
assistance projects. The CAPs are being
sharpened to reflect ADB’s focus on poverty
reduction. The development stage of each country is a primary consideration; and there is
greater selectivity in the sectors, programs, and
projects in which ADB is developing long-term
partnerships with government.

ADB continued its deep commitment to the
participatory development process, not only in
designing projects and programs, but also in
formulating country operational strategies. The
annual country programming mission—during
which project identification and selection take
place in each DMC—involves extensive consultation with both government and NGOs at
various levels. With the objective of making
stakeholder participation an integral part of its
mainstream business processes, ADB initiated
a regional workshop in early 1999 to seek
specific inputs from a representative range of
participants from DMC governments and NGOs
on how such stakeholder participation could
be integrated, from the planning stage to
individual project design. The workshop recommendations form an important part of the
business process redesign initiative that ADB
is presently implementing.

n response to the Asian financial crisis and its

impact on ADB's developing member countries
(DMCs), ADB established a new unit in 1999: the
Regional Economic Monitoring Unit (REMU).
REMU has three major activities: supporting the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
surveillance process, providing inputs on the

financial crisis to various meetings and discussions, and operating the Asia Recovery
Information Center (ARIC).

In 1999, REMU assisted ASEAN with three
interrelated regional technical assistance activities: providing capacity building and training

 

Economics and Development
Resource Center

The role of the Economics and Development
Resource Center (EDRC) is to help ADB achieve
its goals of reducing poverty and improving the
quality of life of all people in Asia and the Pacific.
As ADB's economic research arm and
development resource center, EDRC provides
direct operational support and services to DMCs
through policy research, sector studies and
methodology development, country economic
studies and monitoring, capacity building in
statistics and economic and financial analyses,
and resource center activities for disseminating information and for representing ADB.
EDRC's work program in 1999 was increasingly centered on operational support for poverty reduction by (i) providing research and
analytical support, (ii) building a poverty database, and (iii) enhancing ADB's partnership with
each DMC. Work to document and analyze
existing poverty data compiled by DMCs and
other international agencies was begun. A
poverty database will be established as part of
ADB's Statistical Database System. To facilitate the preparation of country poverty strategies, a major regional study was initiated to
identify and analyze major policy and institutional constraints to poverty reduction in
DMCs, and recommend concrete policy
actions to tackle the constraints. The study
will provide a broad regional analytical framework and perspective for country poverty

strategies. A poverty impact assessment of ADB
assistance was begun in 1999, and is expected
to improve ADB's methodology for distributional
and poverty impact assessment and to become
an integral part of project economic and
financial analyses.

EDRC's capacity-building activities have
also been geared toward helping DMCs improve
poverty measurements and impact analysis.
Resource center activities, aimed at enhancing
its partnership with DMCs and their ownership
of country poverty strategies, include (i) a conference on lessons learned from the past
30 years of research on poverty; (ii) a workshop
on "Beyond Asian Crisis: The Persisting Social
Challenge" as part of the Asian Development
Forum jointly sponsored with ADB Institute and
the World Bank Institute; and (iii) publication
of the Asian Development Outlook featuring the
theme chapter on poverty.

EDRC's other research activities in 1999
reflected efforts to distill lessons learned from
the Asian financial crisis and expand sector
policy studies and methodology research. Three
major studies were undertaken to look into
the governance and structural weaknesses of
the Asian economies and the social ramifications of the Asian financial crisis. Research
findings were widely disseminated through
workshops and conferences held at ADB's
headquarters and ADB Institute in Tokyo. A
regional study was initiated to strengthen
DMC financial management and governance,
and another major study focused on the

one of ADB's initiatives in assisting crisisaffected countries in sustaining economic and
social recovery. The web site functions as a
clearinghouse for information relating to
recovery from the Asian financial crisis of 1997
in all its dimensions. The site was launched by

the Australian Government, which funded the
initiative, and ADB in November 1999 during
the Manila Social Forum (see box on page 27).
The web site, which comprises seven major sections—Recovery Watch, Social Dimensions,

Methodology development in 1999 included the completion of methodologies on
health, water supply, and build-own-operatetransfer projects. Progress was made on methodologies for benefit measurement of urban
sanitation projects and the development impact
of road projects. The financial analysis and
governance aspects of ADB assistance were
strengthened with the establishment of a lead
financial specialist position in EDRC. To support expanded policy-based lending, work was
also initiated to develop a conceptual and
analytical framework for program lending. The
EDRC Methodology Series was launched in early
1999 to disseminate the findings of methodology research. Statistical methodology research
was carried out on data situations and measurement issues related to poverty incidence in
Asia and the Pacific. Research findings were
published in the EDRC Briefing Note Series. As
part of its operational support activities, EDRC
also edited a large volume of project, technical
assistance, and policy documents.

Regional studies completed in 1999 include

Statistical capacity-building activities in
DMCs, completed in 1999, included four
advisory technical assistance grants on statistical system and database improvements and a
regional technical assistance on environment
statistics. Five new advisory technical assistance
activities were initiated to improve national statistical systems in DMCs, particularly in Pacific
DMCs with weak national income accounts
and statistical systems. Three regional technical assistance activities were approved to
improve financial, monetary, and national
income data. Training workshops were
conducted for DMC officials in macroeconomic analysis and structural policies, project
economic and financial analyses, taxation,
and international finance. Work was also
initiated on a CD-ROM version of the Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects
incorporating good practice examples and
tutorials to complement EDRC's regular training
workshops for DMC officials and ADB staff.

In 1999, EDRC's development resource
center activities included networking for knowledge dissemination, ADB representation, and
research dissemination. Major activities for
knowledge dissemination included the (i) Fifth
Joint ADB-Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development International
Forum on Asian Perspectives; (ii) ADB-World
Trade Organization Workshop on Anti-Dumping
and Countervailing Duty Investigation;
(iii) Senior Officials' Meeting on New Trade
Policy Initiatives and Their Impact on DMCs
(sponsored by ADB, Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific, and United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development); (iv) High-Level Regional Workshop on
the Asian Financial Crisis (jointly conducted
with ADB Institute); and (v) Regional Seminar
on Options for Financial Restructuring.

EDRC also organized a Distinguished
Speakers’ Program and launched a Leaders’
Forum for the exchange of views between ADB
staff members, and eminent scholars and public
figures. Modest financial contributions were

 

given to the Colombo Plan Secretariat, the
Overseas Development Council, the International Economic Association, and the American
Committee on Asian Economic Studies to
strengthen research and capacity-building
activities and enhance ADB's profile in the
development community. ADB representation
in the international policy and development
community was also strengthened through
more frequent participation by EDRC senior staff
in high-profile international conferences.

EDRC produced and distributed numerous
publications in 1999, including the annual Asian
Development Outlook and Key Indicators of
Developing Asian and Pacific Countries. The
Asian Development Outlook 1999 Update was
produced in response to the rapid change in
the region's economic outlook and the need
for close economic monitoring. In addition,
22 papers were published and distributed
under the Briefing Notes Series and Monograph Series.

EDRC collaborated closely with ADB
Institute in undertaking policy research,
capacity-building, and development resource
center activities. EDRC focused on emerging
policy issues of operational relevance, while
ADB Institute emphasized broader and longerterm development issues. To ensure complementarity and synergy in research, staff
exchanged views regularly on research topics.
EDRC and ADB Institute jointly conducted three
capacity-building activities: (i) Ninth ADB Tax
Conference, (ii) Ninth Seminar on International
Finance, and (iii) Capacity Building Seminar on
Reforming Corporate Governance in Asia. They
also cosponsored a regional workshop on the
Asian financial crisis.

Asian Development Bank
Institute

The Tokyo-based ADB Institute's second year
was marked by consolidating research and
capacity-building activities and expanding into
new poverty reduction initiatives. A work plan
to guide ongoing and future projects and to
incorporate ADB's goal to reduce poverty was
developed. ADB Institute is exploring the mostCorporate Planning and Support Activities

appropriate development paradigms for Asia
that comprise well-balanced combinations of
the roles of markets, institutions, and governments in the wake of the financial crisis.

Research results were disseminated in both
print and electronic versions through the
new ADB Institute Working Paper series.
Capacity-building proceedings and training
materials were circulated through the Executive
Summary Series and Policy Paper Series for
selected workshops. ADB Institute also started
producing a newsletter and public relations
abstracts. For a list of ADB Institute publications,
see Major ADB Publications on page 306.

In 1999, ADB Institute held several seminar series and evening lectures to publicize
research findings, including a seminar on
Capital Account Crisis and Family-Based
Corporate Governance held during ADB's 32"4
Annual Meeting in the Philippines. These events
targeted opinion-shapers, scholars, officials,
and journalists. The ADB Institute Dean also
delivered presentations on the capital account
crisis at the East-West Center of the University
of Hawaii, and the Foreign Correspondents’ Club
and the National Press Club in Japan.

ADB Institute has been successful in attracting foreign and local media to cover its conferences and special evening seminars. Six major
media events were organized to publicize research
findings and conference outcomes. ADB Institute has been seeking to attract international
media coverage for its key messages so that they
can compete in the wider arena of public debate.
ADB Institute's web site (http:/Avww.adbi.org)
has been upgraded and expanded to include its
publications, media releases, speeches, conference sites, and draft papers.

Under the auspices of ADB Institute, central
bankers and senior regulators from crisis-hit
economies in Asia met for the first time with
their counterparts from Japan, United Kingdom,
and United States to review recent experiences
of changing banking regulations and measures to prevent future crises. High-level
roundtable discussions involving officials
from the Bank for International Settlements
centered on whether bank regulations can be
used to prevent systemic financial failures. A
major international conference on exchange

 

rate regimes for emerging economies also
attracted leading experts in search of greater
options for managing and coordinating exchange rates.

ADB Institute sponsored a new policy forum for ongoing dialogue with Asian intellectual leaders and representatives of influential
policy-oriented research institutions. This
open-ended policy forum was aimed at encouraging intellectual leadership to develop
concrete policy recommendations on urgent
topics. The 15 initial collaborating institutions
began their work by tackling issues of regional
financial cooperation.

In December 1999, on its second anniversary, ADB Institute held a high-profile dialogue
on development paradigms, bringing together
world-renowned economists and key figures
working on the future development course for
Asia and the Pacific, including Japan's Finance
Minister, current and former ADB Presidents,
ADB Institute's Advisory Council, and ADB's
Board of Directors.

Seventeen capacity-building and training

rograms were conducted in 1999, reaching
850 individuals from 45 member countries,
resulting in about 2,700 participant-days. These
rograms were cosponsored by 10 agencies,
including the Colombo Plan Secretariat,
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, United Nations Children's Fund,
and United Nations Development Programme.
Specially commissioned case studies and
earning manuals were developed for education
and skill formation, public expenditure
management, and public-private partnerships.
Capacity-building workshops were also held
or the first time in Cambodia, Sri Lanka, and
Viet Nam.
At the end of 1999, ADB Institute had a staff
of 27, comprising 13 professional staff memers and 14 supporting staff members. Six visiting scholars, supported by 11 research
associates, were at the Institute intermittently.
Combined, personnel come from 18 of ADB's
58 members. The ADB Institute's Advisory
Council (see Appendix 5) reviewed the 1999 and
2000 work programs, which were approved,
together with their respective budgets, by ADB's
Board of Directors.150

ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

Resident and regional missions
and representative offices

ADB's resident and regional missions and representative offices support its poverty reduction
goal by strengthening representation in its regional and nonregional members, and by providing broader and more direct access to ADB's
constituencies.

Resident missions

ADB has 10 resident missions, one each in
Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia,
azakhstan, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,
Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam. Missions in the
yrgyz Republic and the Lao People's
Democratic Republic were approved in 1999 and
will be established in 2000. In 1999, ADB relocated its resident mission in Kazakhstan from
Almaty to Astana, the new capital of the counry, allowing ADB to strengthen its development
partnership with Kazakhstan and respond more
effectively to the country's requests for assisance. ADB continues to use its original mission in Almaty as a liaison office. ADB also has
hree extended missions in Indonesia, Papua
New Guinea, and Thailand, which administer
specific projects and programs.

In 1999, work began on a resident mission
policy! outlining the framework and strategic
reorientation of the resident missions, in which
it was noted that they provide the primary operational interface between ADB and the host
DMC. The resident missions’ strategic objectives
are to (i) promote the implementation of ADB's
overarching goal of poverty reduction and reated strategic objectives in DMCs, (ii) enhance
policy dialogue with DMCs by providing highquality and timely advice, (iii) be a recognized
intellectual resource and knowledge base on
development issues in DMCs, and (iv) enhance
he visibility of ADB and its activities in DMCs.
[heir partnership objectives are to (i) create
strong partnerships with DMC development
stakeholders, including governments, the private sector, and civil society; (ii) enhance ADB's

 

 

responsiveness to local needs and issues;
(iii) take leadership in aid coordination where
possible, and build strong relationships with
other funding sources; and (iv) promote
subregional cooperation.

The primary functions of the resident missions in 1999 were administering loans and
technical assistance, coordinating funding, acting as liaison to the governments, disseminating information, and coordinating ADB's work
with NGOs. For example, the Bangladesh Resident Mission (BRM) assisted in preparing the
new country strategy for Bangladesh. In the area
of funding coordination, the Viet Nam Resident
Mission (VRM) worked closely with the World
Bank Resident Mission in Viet Nam on pilot
testing the comprehensive development framework in the country. Also, VRM conducted for
the first time a joint portfolio review with the
Government, Japan Bank for International
Cooperation, and World Bank, resulting in an
action plan to address issues affecting project
implementation in the country. In the area of
government liaison, the Indonesia Resident
Mission (IRM) worked closely with the
Government's audit agency to improve the
submission of project financial statements
and audited accounts and to assist in complying with requirements for submitting
reports in English.

In their information dissemination role,
several missions, including IRM and VRM, translated and distributed key documents in the local
language. Several resident missions established
web sites in 1999; and others, such as BRM,
the India Resident Mission, and the Pakistan
Resident Mission, produced newsletters.

Regional mission

The South Pacific Regional Mission (SPRM)
in Port Vila, Vanuatu was opened in 1984 to
liaise with the eight member nations in the
South Pacific: Cook Islands, Fiji Islands,
Kiribati, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga,
Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. SPRM assists with administering loan and technical assistance projects

in the South Pacific; promoting coordination
with the governments and bilateral and multilateral funding agencies; undertaking activities
relating to country programming, processing of
new loan and technical assistance projects, and
managing portfolios; providing economic and
other inputs for ADB's policy, project, and institutional development in the region; disseminating information about ADB activities; and
promoting private sector development.

Representative offices

ADB has representative offices in Europe
(Frankfurt), Japan (Tokyo), and North America
(Washington, DC). Each strengthens ADB's representation in its donor members and assists
in its resource mobilization efforts by promoting cofinancing with official and commercial
sources. Through its representative offices, ADB
interacts regularly with key decision makers and
informs them of ADB activities. The representative offices also help raise ADB's profile with
key interest groups and the public at large.
They enable ADB to communicate more
effectively and in a more timely manner with
the development community, businesses,
academics, and NGOs. Other important functions are information dissemination and
public relations through their respective
newsletters, attendance at book fairs and
exhibits, speaking engagements, and media
arrangements.

In 1999, ADB reviewed the activities of the
representative offices, noting their primary
responsibility of enhancing public awareness
of and support for ADB.

Support activities

Information systems and technology

In 1999, guidelines were developed for using the
Information Systems and Technology Strategy

(ISTS) Capital Expenditure Budget, 1998-2002.
Procedures were put in place to monitor the

 

technical and budgetary aspects of the ISTS and
to provide periodic reports on its progress.

Under ISTS, the initial phase of ADB's network infrastructure project was undertaken and
an optical fiber backbone and new hubs were
installed to connect the local area networks on
each floor of the headquarters building. Seven
powerful servers were installed to replace
27 existing servers. Two additional servers were
acquired to support Internet access. A new software package was installed to replace the
existing Society for Worldwide Interbank
Financial Telecommunications terminal system.
A project to upgrade ADB's network, security,
and backup servers was also begun.

In the area of systems development, technical support was provided in the development
of the Loan Financial Information Web Services,
which was implemented for access over the
Internet by ADB and its DMCs (see box on page
54). This system makes available comprehensive loan financial information and debt service projections.

The Environment and Social Monitoring
System was redeveloped to add new features
and convert the system from a mainframe
application to a client-server application. Euro
conversion facilities were developed for the
Capital Subscription System, the Borrowings
Portfolio System, and the Staff Retirement
System. With the exception of one country, all
loans denominated wholly or partially in currencies of European Monetary Union members
were converted to the euro.

The last phases of ADB's internal year 2000
(Y2K) compliance program were completed.’ All
remaining noncompliant hardware and software
were replaced or upgraded, and the new
components were certified by their suppliers. A
Y2K contingency plan was prepared and coordinated with all departments and offices to
ensure that ADB's critical business functions
would continue uninterrupted from 1 January
2000 onward.

In-country dial-up connections from most
members to ADB's headquarters network were
also made available.

ADB. The Archives repository conforms to
international standards on archival storage and
is listed in the Guide to the Archives of
International Organizations, an electronic
publication of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization.

In 1999, to increase awareness of the
archival program, the Archives held two
exhibits: Changing Directions of the Bank,
which coincided with the 32"4 Annual Meeting
of the Board of Governors; and ADB Staff: The
Way We Were, which was held in December and
focused on the staff during ADB’s first 10 years.
The Archives also continued its active program
to acquire historical ADB documents and add
them to the collection.

Library

The Library, with a collection of approximately
200,000 volumes, is ADB's knowledge resource
center for printed and electronic information.
It provides research assistance in all disciplines
related to ADB's strategic objectives, programs,
and projects. The collection specializes in
development economics, key economic sectors,
and the countries of Asia and the Pacific.
Sectoral emphasis includes agriculture, energy,
finance, environment, law, transport and
communications, and social infrastructure.

A full range of library services supports
ADB's operational staff working in 38 DMCs. In
addition, educational institutions and individual
researchers from around the world make
regular use of the Library's collections and

services via the Internet, telephone or fax
inquiries, or in-person visits.

Internet services and access were enhanced
in the Library in 1999.

The Library continued to broaden its
outreach activities with exhibits. In 1999, the
Library held three exhibits: (i) Focus: Central
Asia; (ii) Resettlement: Improving Benefits,
Minimizing Losses; and (iii) a publications
exhibit for the Manila Social Forum.

Public Information Center

The Public Information Center (PIC) under the
Office of External Relations increases awareness and understanding of ADB's activities,
strategies, and objectives among the public and
policymakers in its DMCs and donor members
by making available to the public—either free
of charge or for purchase, depending on the
publication—ADB publications, information
brochures, documents, and videos.

The PIC is the dispatch point for ADB's
Depository Library Program, a worldwide
network of about 140 libraries that offers the
public free access to ADB documents and
publications, and for the NGO network. More
than 2,500 documents were sent to NGOs
in 1999.

In 1999, more documents were made available on ADB's web site (http:/Avww.adb.org),
especially those covered by the Policy on
Confidentiality and Disclosure of Information.
Also, several new publications were published,
in print and electronic formats, to increase
awareness of ADB's focus on reducing poverty.

ADB produced 22 publications in 1999,
including Asian Development Outlook and Key
Indicators of Developing Member Countries.Administration

Human resource management
and development

uman resource management activi
ties in 1999 focused on further devel
oping and implementing effective

human resource-related policies and
strategies. These efforts included putting into
effect ADB's nine-point Gender Action Plan to
achieve gender balance, enhancing the external recruitment and selection of professional
staff, revising the selection system for supporting staff positions, and improving the procedures for selecting staff in resident and regional
missions and representative offices.

In support of ADB’s overarching goal of
fighting poverty, a Poverty Reduction Unit was
established in the Strategy and Policy Department. Also in 1999, attention was focused on
managing ADB's desired skills-mix through
redeployment efforts; recruiting professionals
with skills in critical areas of ADB operations;
and supporting associated policy initiatives such
as private sector development, governance,
capacity building, and anticorruption.

As part of its continuing assessment of
training needs, ADB broadened its coverage of
managerial and supervisory training and developed specific training oriented to its operational

 

needs. New technical training was offered in
the areas of economic analysis, privatization
and commercialization, environmental instruments, financial analysis and management,
public-private partnerships in the social sector, fiscal decentralization, and governance.
Senior staff members were also included in
training programs on ethics and anticorruption.
Many staff members attended training seminars
and conferences in the Philippines and elsewhere to update their skills and keep abreast
of the latest developments in their expertise.
To actively support staff members in formal education programs at the duty station and through
distance learning, ADB is now providing
10 working days to staff members taking
examinations and defending theses or dissertations, or attending activities related to operations. As part of its outreach training, ADB
conducted its annual Orientation Program for
Developing Member Country Officials to help
participants better understand ADB's operations. ADB also provided students in master's
and doctorate programs from accredited universities the opportunity for a two-month
internship in its Internship Program.

At the end of 1999, ADB had a staff of 1,973
coming from 46 of its 58 members. The total
comprised 685 professional staff members! and
1,288 supporting staff members,” of which

The representation of women as part of
ADB's total professional staff increased significantly from 10 percent in 1994 to 22 percent in
1999. About 47 percent of professional staff
appointed in 1999 were women, compared with
21 percent in 1994.ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

 

180° were in the resident and regional missions
and representative offices. During the year,
there were 68 appointments and 68 departures
of professional staff, while 54 supporting staff
members joined ADB and 59 left. At the end of
1999, women professional staff numbered 151,
or 22 percent of the total.

Compensation and benefits

Acomprehensive review of the professional staff
compensation and benefits scheme, leading to
budgetary savings, was completed in 1999. In
response to changes in market salaries, ADB
approved a 2 percent salary increase for professional staff effective 1 May 1999 and an
11.5 percent salary increase for supporting staff
effective 1 April 1999. ADB also changed the
timing of the professional staff salary increase
to 1 January to coincide with ADB's fiscal year
and the performance evaluation review. As a
result, a 1.9 percent salary increase was
approved for 2000. The supporting staff compensation system was examined and a comprehensive benefits survey was conducted in 1999,
with the results to be incorporated in the 2000
review of supporting staff salaries and benefits. A review of the terms and conditions of
employment at field offices was initiated.
Increased emphasis was also placed on health
education and the provision of medical
services to staff.

Administrative services

ADB continued to rationalize its administrative
services, enhance cost-effectiveness and
strengthen internal control, streamline its
business processes, and simplify and automate
work procedures.

Initiatives undertaken in the administrative
area included the computerization of various
work processes, resulting in a reduction of
consumables and cost savings in the publication of documents. Management of office

 

supplies was streamlined, thereby saving three
staff positions. An increase in the number of
ocean/air freight origin/destination services in
overseas locations led to cost- effectiveness and
improved quality of services because of
increased competition. For transportation services, agency drivers have been engaged,
resulting in significant savings.

Budget

Actual internal administrative expenses (IAE) for
1999 amounted to $198.5 million, a saving of
$8.5 million against the original budget of
$207.0 million. The saving resulted because of
lower-than-expected staff costs and effective
budgetary resource management.

The IAE 2000 budget of $215.4 million
(summarized in Appendix 8) has been formulated with an increase of 30 new professional
staff positions to (i) implement ADB's overarching objective of reducing poverty and its
interlinked initiatives such as good governance, anticorruption, private sector development, regional cooperation, and policy on
resident missions; (ii) provide adequate staff
resources in strengthening ADB's operational
capacity to deliver a broader range and higher
volume of quality services; and (iii) respond
to the changing needs of its developing member countries (DMCs). Against the increase in
staff resources, ADB has continued its costsaving measures, including extensive staff
redeployment, business process reforms, and
benefits rationalization to keep budget growth
at a minimum level.

Financial management and
human resource management
information system

In October 1999, ADB launched its Financial
Management and Human Resource Management Information System (FM/HRMIS) Project

with the signing of a $13.4 million contract‘
with Oracle Systems (Philippines) Inc. and its
partners? for an integrated software package,
ancillary implementation services, and
required hardware. The FM/HRMIS Project, a
major component of ADB's Information
Systems and Technology Strategy for 19982002, will result in the migration of ADB's
major application systems to a client/server
technology environment.

The FM/HRMIS Project aims to strengthen
ADB's delivery of its development services by
streamlining, automating, and integrating
business processes in the human resource,
finance, treasury/banking, and project/
product areas. Information access, quality,
reliability, and timeliness will improve with
the introduction of better business practices
and processes founded on an integrated software package.

Project implementation officially commenced on 15 November 1999 and will be
phased over three years. The human resource
module will be introduced in January 2001,
followed by finance and treasury/banking in
June 2001, and the project/product areas in
January 2002. The software package will be
implemented at headquarters and at ADB's
resident and regional missions and representative offices. Work undertaken in 1999 included
training project team members, documenting
ADB's current business processes, building staff
awareness about the project, and developing a
project web site.

Audit and anticorruption

ADB's focus on good governance is of paramount significance in achieving its overarching
objective to reduce poverty. For good governance, it is necessary to have adequate and
effective control in the functioning of activities
being funded by ADB and to ensure streamlined
procedures therein.

 

The Office of the General Auditor (OGA)
conducts periodic, independent, and objective
appraisals of ADB activities to ensure the
adequacy and effectiveness of controls, and to
identify the means of improving economy and
efficiency in the use of resources in carrying
out ADB's development mission. OGA is also the
focal point in ADB's drive against corruption and
for dealing with alleged incidents of corruption
or fraud in its projects or by its staff, which is
aimed at ensuring proper discipline in governance. OGA reports directly to the President.
Its activities are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Internal audits conducted in 1999 led to
recommendations for (i) minimizing foreign
exchange exposures in ADB's equity investment
portfolio through alternative funding options,
hedging of these exposures, and enhancing
management information to monitor them
adequately; (ii) establishing stop-loss limits on
income-enhancement activities involving the
use of financial derivatives on the investment
portfolio; (iii) enhancing the management and
monitoring of ADB's credit risk relating to
settlement by introducing daily delivery limits for each counterparty; (iv) improving the
imprest account operations and the verification process of Statement of Expenditures
transactions; (v) providing an integrated
database of cofinancing information and
facilitating access to that database; (vi) dovetailing the Project Processing Information
System with the requirements of the users
regarding cofinancing data; (vii) facilitating
the timely calculation of guarantee fees on
cofinancing accounts; and (viii) reviewing
existing criteria for short- and long-term
consultancies for placing suitable limitations
on engagements with ADB to address the risk
posed by the frequent reengagement of consultants. OGA likewise audited six consulting contracts in 1999 with the assistance of
independent auditors. These audits confirmed
the effectiveness of the control procedures for

selecting consultants for ADB-financed technical assistance projects. The ADB-wide Study on
Internal Controls relating to procurement of
goods and services for ADB-financed projects
was completed in 1999.

Consequent to ADB's adoption of the
Anticorruption Policy in 1998, an Anticorruption Unit (OGA-AU) was established within OGA
in 1999. OGA-AU prepared the Procedural
Guidelines for Dealing with Complaints and
Allegations of Fraud and Corruption consistent
with the draft Operations Manual and the Guidelines on Operational Procedures on Anticorruption. Management approved the procedural
guidelines in November 1999. Guiding principles
for sanctions in the context of fraud and corruption were also prepared and approved. As
of 31 December 1999, OGA-AU had processed
55 cases, of which 42 (76 percent) have subsequently been closed and 13 (24 percent) were
still being investigated. Management has
declared 10 firms and 14 individuals ineligible
to participate in ADB-financed projects for various periods as a result of corrupt or fraudulent
acts. In pursuing ADB's Anticorruption Policy,
OGA-AU also conducted a project audit in a
selected DMC to identify measures for improving the accountability for managing project
funds and supervising ADB-financed projects,
by ADB and by the executing agencies and their
auditors. OGA-AU has taken steps to collaborate with the DMCs' supreme audit institutions
in conducting further project audits. In coordination with ADB's Human Resources Division,
OGA-AU prepared training materials and conducted fraud awareness seminars for ADB's
managers and regional/resident representatives,

and conducted briefings on the Anticorruption
Policy for new staff.

OGA has taken a proactive role by directly
contributing to ADB's efforts to upgrade auditing capabilities in DMCs as part of its long-term
anticorruption initiatives. Improvements in
government accounting and auditing systems
will promote accountability and prevent or
minimize fraud and corruption in public sector
management. OGA continued to supervise a
regional technical assistance project for the
Asian Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions. OGA supervised another regional technical assistance project to provide long-term
audit training programs to the South Pacific
Association of Supreme Audit Institutions, and
a technical assistance project to strengthen the
auditing system of the Government of the
People's Republic of China.

OGA actively participated in (i) ADB's efforts
to ensure that all hardware and software would
function correctly from 1 January 2000; (ii) the
working group that monitored the activities of
DMCs in addressing the year 2000 (Y2K) issue;
and (iii) the fallback tests of the Society for
World Interbank Financial Telecommunications
(SWIFT) in Manila and Hong Kong, China to
ensure that SWIFT activities can continue at
these fallback sites if necessary. At SWIFT's
request, OGA independently conducted mandatory tests on the SWIFT system and certified the
system to be Y2K compliant.

In addition, OGA provided integrated
assistance to ADB's external auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (International Firm),
who undertook a continuing audit of ADB's annual financial statements throughout the year.ADB Resources and
Financial Management

DB's financial resources comprise its

ordinary capital resources (OCR) and

special funds. Both are examined in

this chapter, as are other funds
administered by ADB.

Ordinary capital resources

OCR funds come from three distinct sources:
(i) private capital markets in the form of borrowings; (ii) paid-in capital provided by government funds; and (iii) accumulated retained
income (reserves), which provides a buffer for
any operational risk.

Financial policies: ADB's loan charges were
reviewed in 1999 to determine how ADB can
maintain its financial soundness while taking
into account the interest of all stakeholders. The
review focused on how ADB can maintain the
desired levels of its decisive income indicators:
the interest coverage ratio (ICR) and the
reserve:loan ratio (RLR). The ICR is the ratio of
net income to financial expenses plus a factor
of one. It measures the extent to which net
income can fall without jeopardizing its ability
to service ADB's financial expenses from current income. Because loan income and financial expenses are closely related, the ICR also
provides a direct measure of the extent loan
income can drop without resulting in a negative net income. The review of ADB's income
and reserves policy, undertaken by the Board
of Directors in 1997, concluded that the
minimum policy level for the ICR should be
about 1.31.

The RLR is a ratio that measures the
adequacy of ADB's earning base relative to its
loan assets. It is computed by dividing total reserves by outstanding loans plus equity
investments and the present value of guarantees. The adequacy of the RLR is determined in

terms of the capacity of the earning base to
generate the minimum net income requirements
to protect ADB against country credit risks or
the minimum policy level for ICR. The policy
approved in the 1997 review was to maintain
the RLR at about 25 percent.

To comply with ADB's policies on these two
decisive income indicators, maintain ADB's
financial soundness, and address concerns of
increased risk in its loan portfolio, the Board
of Directors approved a new loan charge policy
in December 1999 to take effect from 1 January
2000. The new loan charge structure has three
components.

(i) The lending spread—the difference

between the cost to the borrower and
ADB's funding cost—will be raised to
0.6 percent from 0.4 percent. This will
apply to all outstanding pool-based
loans for both existing and new loans.
The overwhelming majority of OCR
loans are pool-based. The increased
spread will also apply to new public
sector loans under the market-based
loan window.

(ii) Anew front-end fee of 1 percent will
be charged on new loans. Borrowers
will have the option of including this
charge in the loan.

(iii) The commitment fee for new program
loans will carry a flat 0.75 percent annual fee instead of a progressive rate
as before. The commitment fee for
new project loans will remain unchanged.

Capitalization: As of 31 December 1999,
ADB's authorized capital stock amounted to
$47.9 billion (special drawing rights
[SDR]34.9 billion). The subscribed capital stock
of ADB stood at $47.6 billion (SDR34.7 billion).

Performance and allocation of net income

At the end of 1999, ADB's ICR was 1.31 and the
RLR was 25.97 percent. During the year, in accordance with the income and reserves policy
approved in 1997, ADB reviewed its income
outlook and allocation of 1998 net income. On
the basis of the review, the Board of Directors
approved the following:

(i) ADB can convert currency for 1999 in
the amount of about $300 million as
part of its long-term strategy to align
currencies in reserves with those o
outstanding loans;

(ii) the Board of Directors recommend to
the Board of Governors that the entire
amount of $464.2 million of 1998 ne
income after appropriation of guarantee fees to the special reserve be
allocated to the ordinary reserve; an

(iii) | the Board of Directors recommend to
the Board of Governors that $80 million of the amount currently held in
ADB's surplus account be reallocate
to the Technical Assistance Specia
Fund (TASE).

Lending rates: ADB has three lending windows for loans from OCR: the pool-base
multicurrency loan window, the pool-based
single currency loan window in US dollars, ani
the market-based loan (MBL) window. The lending rates for the pool-based multicurrency and
pool-based single currency loan windows are determined on the basis of the average cost o
borrowings as well as a Board-approved loan
spread (40 basis points up to 31 December 1999).
The MBL window provides single-currency loans
in US dollars, Japanese yen, or Swiss francs to
private sector borrowers and governmentguaranteed financial intermediaries at current
terms. The interest rates on loans from the MBL
window are on either fixed or floating rate terms.

ADB's pool-based variable lending rates for
the first half of 1999 were 5.84 percent for
multicurrency loans and 6.38 percent for US
dollar loans. For the second half of 1999, the
lending rate for multicurrency loans decreased

The lending rates for MBLs are determined
on the basis of the six-month London interbank
offered rate (LIBOR) plus a lending spread. The
lending spread for MBL loans to financial
intermediaries in the public sector is the same
as that applicable for OCR pool-based loans.
For private enterprises, the lending spread is
determined on a case-to-case basis to cover ADB's
risk exposure to particular borrowers and projects.

Income and expenses: Gross income
increased by 10.7 percent, from $1.8 billion in
1998 to $2 billion in 1999, because of an increase
in loan income and income from other sources
net of a decrease in investment income. Of the

Total operating expenses were

rise in expenses was because of a
$240.7 million increase in financial expenses,
net of a $15.8 million decrease in administrative
expenses, and a $12.6 million decrease in the
provision for losses. Total operating expenses
accounted for 77.8 percent of the gross income,
compared with 74.5 percent in 1998.

Net income for 1999, before appropriation
of guarantee fees to the Special Reserve,
amounted to $449.9 million, a 3.6 percent
decrease from 1998. This compared with a
0.2 percent decrease in net income in 1998.

Loans

OCR loan approvals, disbursements, and repayments: In 1999, 34 OCR loans totaling $3.9 billion were approved, compared with 39 loans
totaling $5.0 billion approved in 1998. Of the
1999 amount, 74.3 percent of the loans were
made to People's Republic of China, Indonesia,
and India. Disbursements in 1999 totaled
$3.7 billion, a decrease of 34.0 percent from
$5.6 billion in 1998. High disbursements in 1998
resulted from emergency program loans in
response to the Asian financial crisis. Principal

amounted to $28.3 billion.

Status of loans: Two public sector OCR
loans to Myanmar and 11 private sector loans
were in nonaccrual status at the end of 1999.
The total outstanding balances of these loans
amounted to $929,000 and $72.0 million,
respectively, comprising about 0.3 percent of
the total OCR loans outstanding.

Borrowings

The major objectives of ADB's borrowing and
liability management strategy are to ensure the
availability of long-term funds for lending
operations, fund the liquidity portfolio, and
minimize the cost of borrowing for ADB and its
borrowing member countries. To achieve these
objectives, ADB seeks to
(i) maintain a borrowing presence in the
major capital markets and, where
possible, increase the size of its public
bond issues to provide benchmark
issues that increase liquidity in theANNUAL REPORT 1999

In 1999, ADB raised funds totaling about
$5.2 billion, of which $4.8 billion was in longermaturity borrowings and the remainder in eurocommercial paper liabilities. The average life
of the 1999 longer-maturity borrowings was
about 4.5 years, assuming exercise of put
options for certain borrowings. After swaps,
about $3.0 billion of the total longer-maturity
funds was in US dollar fixed-rate liabilities with
an average all-in cost of 5.6 percent per annum,
compared with 5.3 percent per annum in 1998.
The remainder consisted of US dollar floatingrate liabilities with an average life of 3.3 years.
Of the total borrowings, about $3.4 billion was
designated for use in the US dollar pool-based
lending window, $1.5 billion for the $4.0 billion
Financial Sector Program loan to the Republic of
Korea, and $309 million for the MBL window.

In 1999, ADB successfully completed several benchmark transactions: two US dollar
global bond issues in the principal amounts
of $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion; an Australian dollar (A$) domestic public bond issue in the principal amount of A$500 million with a five-year
maturity; and a New Taiwan dollar (NT$) multitranche public bond offering of NT$10 billion in
the domestic bond market of Taipei,China. The
Australian dollar offering represents ADB's second benchmark issue in the domestic bond market
of Australia, while the NT$10 billion transaction
was the largest ever foreign bond issue in the New
Taiwan dollar debt market. Apart from the benchmark transactions, ADB completed six targeted
opportunistic financing and private placements
totaling about $1.9 billion.

Liquidity portfolio management

The liquidity portfolio functions as a buffer on
the balance sheet; it provides protection against
adverse cash flow situations. ADB's policy is to
maintain the year-end level of liquid assets at
no less than 40 percent of undisbursed loan
balances. This helps ensure the uninterrupted
availability of funds to meet loan disbursements,
debt servicing, and other expenses. In addition,
the liquidity portfolio contributes to ADB's
earning base.

investment of liquid assets. Its primary objective
is to ensure security and liquidity of funds invested. Subject to meeting this objective, ADB
seeks to maximize the return on investments.

ADB's investments are made in the same
currencies as received. In accordance with its
Charter, ADB does not convert currencies for
investment purposes. At present, liquid investments are held in 21 currencies.

In 1999, the Board of Directors approved
a new investment strategy and authority. The
new investment strategy is designed to optimize
the combination of assets in the portfolio to
maximize the expected portfolio return for a
given risk level. This involves introducing
higher-yielding investment instruments, such
as high-quality corporate bonds, mortgagebacked securities, and asset-backed securities;
extending core portfolio durations; and efficiently restructuring the liquidity portfolio into
core and cash segments to maximize overall
return while continuing to meet ADB's liquidity
requirements. Portfolio performance will be
compared with the return of external performance benchmarks. In addition, external
asset managers will be hired to manage certain
parts of the liquidity portfolio. The transition
phase leading to full implementation of the new
investment strategy is expected to last at least
until the end of 2000.

In 1999, the liquid assets were held mainly
in obligations of member governments and162

ANNUAL REPORT 1999

 

other official entities, time deposits, and other
money market investments. OCR investments
increased to $8.2 billion equivalent as of
31 December 1999 from $8.1 billion equivalent
as of 31 December 1998. The realized rate of return on overall OCR investments was 3.9 percent,
compared with 5.3 percent in 1998.

Risk management: The Risk Management
Division of the Treasurer's Department, established in September 1998, is responsible for
formulating and implementing guidelines, procedures, and systems for treasury risk management
activities. The Division identifies, quantifies, and
monitors credit and market-risk exposure relating to the Treasurer's Department activities. In
addition, the Division undertakes performance
measurement and monitoring compared with
benchmarks, and administers the selection and
monitoring of external asset managers for ADB's
liquidity portfolio and for its Staff Retirement Plan.

Special funds

ADB is authorized by its Charter to establish
and administer special funds, which currently
comprise the Asian Development Fund (ADF);
Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF); Japan
Special Fund (JSF), including the Asian Currency
Crisis Support Facility (ACCSF); and ADB
Institute Special Fund.

Asian Development Fund

The ADF is the concessional lending window
of ADB that provides loans to its developing member countries (DMCs) with low per capita gross
national product and limited debt repayment
capacity. The governments of 26 donor members
(both regional and nonregional) have contributed
to the ADF, which is the only multilateral source
of concessional assistance dedicated exclusively
to the needs of Asia and the Pacific. The ADF
supports activities that promote poverty reduction and improvement in the quality of life of
ADB's poorer DMCs. The ADF is therefore an
important instrument of multilateral cooperation
for achieving poverty reduction through equitable and sustainable development in the
poorest countries of Asia and the Pacific.

ADF VIII initial meeting: The first meeting
for the ADF VIII negotiations was held on
13-14 October 1999 in Brisbane, Australia. The
meeting was highlighted by discussions on the
existing environment for ADF VIII; the ADF VIII
vision, theme, and strategic focus; elements of
ADB's strategies for poverty reduction and good
governance; performance-based allocation as
applied to ADF operations; and various issues
relating to the ADF's financial management.

ADF VII: The current replenishment of the
ADF (known as ADF VII) was authorized by Resolution No. 247 of the Board of Governors on
22 March 1997. The replenishment total, based
on the exchange rates specified in the Resolution,
was $2.6 billion. By the end of December 1999,
all the donors had deposited their Instruments of
Contribution to ADF VII. The Instruments of Contribution of Canada; Taipei,China; and United
States contained qualifications, as permitted by
the Resolution, that payment of all installments,
except the first, was subject to subsequent
budgetary appropriations.

The Resolution envisaged that contributions to ADF VII would become available to ADB
for operational commitments in four equal
installments during 1997-2000. All except two
donors paid their first and second installments
in 1997 and 1998. One donor paid its first

installment in 1998 and its second installment
in 1999, while the United States paid its first
installment in January 1998 and 23 percent of
its second installment in January 1999. As the
United States was unable to pay its second
installment in full, five donors—Austria, France,
Germany, Malaysia, and Turkey—exercised their
pro rata rights permitted by the Resolution and
provided only 23 percent of their third installments. All except three donors provided their third
installments during 1999, either fully or partially.

In April 1999, a Progress Report on the
Implementation of the ADF VII Donors' Report,
prepared in January 1997, was submitted to
donors. The Progress Report discussed progress
on policy issues as well as ADF VII availability
and allocation of resources and financial management, and concluded that there was a need
to commence ADF VIII negotiations in the second half of 1999 and complete them in 2000 to
enable ADF VIII to become effective in 2001.

ADF VI: In January 1999, the United States
made available $187 million, which represented
the balance ofits ADF VI third and fourth tranches.
Asaresult, Austria, France, Germany, Switzerland,
and Turkey—which had exercised their pro rata
rights—teleased the full amount of their ADF VI
fourth tranches, totaling $134 million.

ADF loan approvals, disbursements, and
repayments: In 1999, 32 ADF loans totaling
$1.1 billion were approved, compared with
27 loans totaling $987.1 million approved in 1998.
Of the 1999 amount, about 54.1 percent went to
Bangladesh, Viet Nam, and Sri Lanka. Disbursements in 1999 totaled $1.1 billion, approximately the same level as in 1998. At the end of
the year, cumulative disbursements from ADF
resources were $15.4 billion. Loan repayments
during the year amounted to $177.3 million, and
cumulative repayments were $1.4 billion. As of
31 December 1999, ADF loans outstanding
amounted to $16.0 billion, net of the allowance
for possible losses of $6.9 million.

Status of loans: Four ADF loans to
Afghanistan and 28 to Myanmar were in
nonaccrual status as of the end of the year. Total
outstanding ADF loans to Afghanistan amounted to $33.1 million and to Myanmar $502.6 million, together comprising about 3.4 percent of
the total ADF loans outstanding.

Portfolio position: The ADF investment
portfolio at the end of 1999 amounted to
$2.1 billion, compared with $1.4 billion at the
end of 1998. About 86 percent of the portfolio
was invested in deposits and other bank instruments in member countries. The remainder was
held in securities issued or guaranteed by their
governments. The realized rate of return on ADF
investments in 1999 was 4.0 percent, compared
with 4.6 percent in 1998.

The portfolio was denominated in 14 currencies, with yen and US dollars accounting for
37.6 percent of the portfolio.

ADF revenue and expenses: In 1999, the
excess of ADF revenue over expenses (net income)
was $122.4 million, bringing the accumulated
surplus to $1.3 billion at the end of the year.

Gross revenue, consisting mainly of revenue from ADF investments and service fees on
ADF loans, amounted to $218.4 million.
Expenses primarily comprise administration
charges payable to OCR of $95.5 million and
provision for losses of $469,000.

Technical Assistance Special Fund

Review of activities: In May 1999, the Board of
Governors approved the reallocation of $80 million from OCR's surplus account to the TASF.
During the year, Pakistan made a direct voluntary contribution (its 23") to the TASF, amounting to $70,000 equivalent. This was made ona
wholly untied basis.

At the end of 1999, total TASF resources
amounted to $809.2 million. Of this, $692.9 million had been committed, leaving an uncommitted balance of $116.3 million. For details,
see Table 32 in the Statistical Annex.

Operations and resource position: Technical assistance committed (approved and effective) increased from $36 million in 1998 to
$63.1 million in 1999 with 164 technical assistance projects effective during the year. During
1999, $7 million ($15.6 million in 1998), representing completed and canceled technical
assistance projects, was written back as a
reduction in technical assistance for the period
and the corresponding undisbursed commitment was eliminated. Revenue from investments increased from $5.9 million in 1998 toANNUAL REPORT 1999

Japan Special Fund

Review of activities: In 1999, the Government
of Japan contributed yen (¥)5.8 billion ($48.6 million equivalent) to the JSF, comprising regular contributions of ¥20 billion ($16.8 million equivalent),
and supplementary contributions of ¥3.8 billion
($31.8 million equivalent). As of 31 December
1999, Japan's cumulative contribution to the JSF,
since its inception in 1988, amounted to
¥86.5 billion (about $745 million equivalent).
This amount comprised regular contributions
of ¥68.4 billion and supplementary contributions of ¥18.1 billion. In 1999, ADB approved
91 technical assistance grants for JSF funding
in an aggregate amount of $61.0 million. The
uncommitted balance as of 31 December 1999
was $69.9 million. For details, see Table 33 in
the Statistical Annex.

In connection with ADB's overarching
goal of eliminating poverty from the region,
the JSF continued to support ADB operations

aimed at poverty reduction in line with the
three pillars of the new strategy: pro-poor,
sustainable economic growth, social development, and good governance. In 1999, the JSF
also continued to provide significant support
to ADB's technical assistance program, with
emphasis on agriculture and natural resources, transport and communications,
social infrastructure, and energy.

Sectoral activities: In 1999, the JSF financed
35 percent of the total amount of technical
assistance approved by ADB, including 65 percent of the total amount of project preparatory
technical assistance approved during the year.
The breakdown of JSF approvals by sector is
shown in the table below.

Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility

Review of activities: The ACCSF was established
in March 1999 as an independent component
of the JSF. The ACCSF is funded entirely by the
Government of Japan as part of its financial
assistance under the New Miyazawa Initiative
to those countries in the region most affected
by the recent financial crisis. The ACCSF assists
these DMCs by helping to augment and enhance
the financial support extended by ADB. The
ACCSF is administered by ADB. The beneficiary

countries presently include Indonesia, Republic
of Korea,” Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand.
The ACCSF modalities comprise (i) interest
payment assistance (IPA) and technical assistance grants, and (ii) guarantees. The IPA,
technical assistance, and guarantees for the ACCSF
financing need to be approved during the threeyear period after the establishment of the ACCSF
or during such extended period as the Government
of Japan and ADB may agree if the beneficiary
countries are not fully out of the crisis.

In 1999, the Government of Japan contributed ¥12.5 billion ($104.4 million equivalent)
for the IPA and technical assistance component
of the ACCSF. The uncommitted balance of
funds for IPA and technical assistance was
$19.3 million as of 31 December 1999. For
details, see Table 34 in the Statistical Annex.

In 1999, ADB approved $99.5 million of the
ACCSF funding, comprising $89 million for two
IPA operations and $10.5 million for 11 technical assistance projects (out of the total
amount approved, $95.6 million became effective: IPA $89 million and technical assistance
$6.6 million). IPA was approved for the Health
and Nutrition Sector Development Program
($44 million) and the Community and Local
Government Support Sector Development
Program ($45 million), both in Indonesia, to
alleviate the adverse financial conditions faced
by the country and effectively reduce the interest cost for funding critical social safety nets
during the period of economic difficulties.

The ACCSF financing is targeted at activities
that support policy dialogue, human resource
development, institutional strengthening, and
other relevant efforts focusing on bank restructuring and corporate debt restructuring; creating
or developing sound financial monitoring, supervision, and regulation; enhancing public sector
and corporate governance, developing social
safety nets; and protecting the environment.

In 1999, the ACCSF financed eight advisory
technical assistance activities as part of ADB's
response to the financial crisis. This included
advisory services to implement social safety

The ACCSF also financed three important
technical assistance operations to prepare a
natural resource and environment project in
Indonesia, formulate a project for developing
poor urban communities in the Philippines, and
develop community-based forest resource
management in the Philippines.

The Government of Japan also deposited a
promissory note for ¥360.0 billion ($3.5 billion
equivalent) in the ACCSF custodian account, which
may be encashed to meet a call on any guarantees issued under the ACCSF. Although opportunities for using the ACCSF guarantees in relation
to ADB operations in the DMCs eligible for ACCSF
financing were identified, no ACCSF guarantee
operations were concluded during the year.

Sectoral activities: In 1999, the ACCSF
financed 6 percent of the total amount of technical assistance approved by ADB. The breakdown of the ACCSF technical assistance
approvals by sector is shown in the table above.

As of 31 December 1999, cumulative
commitments amounted to ¥4.3 billion (equivalent to about $34.7 million) excluding translation adjustments. Of the total contributions
received, $22.7 million had been used as of
31 December 1999, mainly for research and
capacity-building activities, including organizing symposia and training, preparing research
reports and publications, and associated
administrative expenses.

As of 31 December 1999, the balance of net

Other funds managed by ADB
Japan Scholarship Program

The Japan Scholarship Program (JSP) was
established in 1988 with financing from the
Government of Japan. The main objective of
the program is to provide an opportunity for
well-qualified citizens of ADB's DMCs to
undertake postgraduate studies in economics, management, science and technology,
and other development-related fields at
selected educational institutions in Asia and
the Pacific. Upon completing their studies,
scholars are expected to contribute to the
economic and social development of their
home countries. The scholarships cover
tuition, books, subsistence allowance, housing allowance, medical insurance, travel, and
research subsidies. Currently, 16 institutions
in 10 countries participate in the JSP.

Between 1988 and 1999, the Government
of Japan contributed more than $34 million to
the JSP. A total of 1,033 scholarships have been
awarded to scholars from 31 member countries.
The number of new scholarships awarded
annually has grown from 49 in 1988 to 122 in
1999. Of the 1,033 scholars, 764 have already
completed their courses. Women have received
288 scholarships.

Channel financing arrangements

The mobilization of official grant cofinancing
plays a vital role in ADB operations. In recent
years, given the TASF and ADF resource constraints, the need has been increasing for ADB to
mobilize grant funds from external sources to
support its technical assistance program and
to finance soft components of loan projects.

A majority of such grants are provided by
bilateral donors under channel financing
arrangements (CFAs). ADB acts as administrator of the funds and applies its own guidelines and procedures on recruitment of
consultants, procurement, disbursement, and
project supervision.

Under a CFA, the donor enters into a comprehensive agreement with ADB whereby (i) the
donor provides an untied grant fund to be
administered by ADB (but the fund does not
become part of ADB's own resources); (ii) the
donor indicates its preferred sectors and recipient countries in the use of the fund; (iii) ADB
regularly provides the donor with a list and
description of technical assistance grants that
satisfy the donor's preferences; and (iv) the
donor and ADB agree on the specific activities to be financed under the fund. Funds provided under a CFA are transferred to an
interest-bearing account and may also be
invested by ADB pending disbursement.
Donors are provided with quarterly financial
statements and progress reports on the use
of the fund. ADB is responsible for project
preparation, processing, and administration.
CFAs may be replenished with additional
funds at the donor's discretion.

The primary advantage of CFAs is that
funding for a number of individual technical
assistance projects may be provided under a
single agreement. Accordingly, they minimize
the need for detailed negotiations on a caseby-case basis and foster administrative efficiency. The first CFA was negotiated in 1980.
Since then, ADB has entered into CFAs with
10 bilateral donors: Australia, Belgium, Finland,
France, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
Sweden, and Switzerland. Since 1980, 111 technical assistance grants have been financed under
CFAs for a total of about $50 million._ Financial Statements and

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Asian Development Bank

In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and the related statements of
income and expenses, of cash flows, and of changes in capital and reserves present
fairly, in all material respects, in terms of United States dollars, the financial position
of the Asian Development Bank—Ordinary Capital Resources at 31 December 1999
and 1998, and the results of its operations, its cash flows, and the changes in its
capital and reserves for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
management of the Asian Development Bank; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits, We conducted our audits
of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for the opinion expressed above.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The accompanying summary statements of
loans and of borrowings as at 31 December 1999 and 1998, and of statement of
subscriptions to capital stock and voting power as at 31 December 1999 are presented
for purposes of additional analyses and are not required parts of the basic financial
Statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied
in the audits of the basic financial statements and in our opinion, is fairly stated in
all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1999 and 1998

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND
LIMITATIONS ON LOANS, GUARANTEES,
AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS

Nature of Operations

The Asian Development Bank (ADB), a multilateral development
finance institution, was established in 1966 with its headquarters in Manila, Philippines. ADB and its operations are
governed by the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development
Bank (the Charter). Its purpose is to foster economic
development and co-operation in the Asian and Pacific region
and to contribute to the acceleration of the process of economic development of the developing member countries
(DMCs) in the region, collectively and individually. ADB provides financial and technical assistance (TA) for projects and
programs which will contribute to achieving this purpose.

Mobilizing financial resources, including cofinancing, is
an integral part of ADB's operational activities. In addition,
ADB, alone or jointly, administers on behalf of donors,
including members, their agencies and other development
institutions, funds restricted for specific uses which include
technical assistance grants as well as regional programs.

ADB's ordinary operations comprise loans, equity
investments, and guarantees. It finances its ordinary operations through borrowings, paid-in capital, and retained
earnings.

Limitations on Loans, Guarantees, and Equity Investments

Article 12, paragraph 1 of the Charter provides that the total
amount outstanding of loans, equity investments, and guarantees made by ADB shall not exceed the total of ADB's
unimpaired subscribed capital, reserves, and surplus, exclusive of the special reserve. At 31 December 1999, the total of
such loans, equity investments, and guarantees aggregated
approximately 77.4% (71.7% — 1998) of the total subscribed
capital, reserves, and surplus as defined.

Article 12, paragraph 3 of the Charter provides that
equity investments shall not exceed 10% of the unimpaired
paid-in capital together with reserves and surplus, exclusive
of the special reserve. At 31 December 1999, such equity
investments represented approximately 3.5% (3.7% — 1998)
of the paid-in capital, reserves, and surplus, as defined.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of members are all functional currencies.
The reporting currency is the United States dollar, and the
financial statements are expressed in thousands of current
United States dollars.

Valuation of Capital Stock

The authorized capital stock of ADB is defined in Article 4,
paragraph 1 of the Charter “in terms of United States dollars
of the weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966”
(the 1966 dollar) and the value of each share is defined as
10,000 1966 dollars. The capital stock had historically been
translated into the current United States dollar (ADB's unit
of account) on the basis of its par value in terms of gold.
From 1973 until 31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on this
basis was $1.20635 per 1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at
which time the Second Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into
effect, currencies no longer have par values in terms of gold.
Pending ADB's selection of the appropriate successor to the
1966 dollar, the capital stock has been valued for purposes
of these financial statements in terms of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) at the value in current United States dollars
as computed by the IMF, with each share valued at SDR10,000.

As of 31 December 1999, the value of the SDR in terms
of the current United States dollar was $1.37338 ($1.40803
- 1998) giving a value for each share of ADB's capital equivalent to $13,733.80 ($14,080.30 - 1998). However, ADB could
decide to fix the value of each share at $12,063.50 based on
the 31 March 1978 par value of the United States dollar in
terms of gold.

Translation of Currencies

Assets and liabilities are translated from their functional
currencies to the reporting currency generally at the applicable
rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period. Income
and expense amounts are translated for each semi-monthly
period generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the
beginning of each period; such practice approximates the
application of average rates in effect during the period. Translation adjustments other than those relating to maintenanceFinancial Statements 183

 

of SDR capital values (see Notes I and J), are charged or
credited to “Accumulated translation adjustments” and
reported in “CAPITAL AND RESERVES” as part of “Accumulated other comprehensive income.”

Investments

All investment securities held by ADB other than derivative
instruments are considered by Management to be available
for sale and are reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from net income and reported in “CAPITAL AND RESERVES’ as part of “Accumulated
other comprehensive income.” All derivative instruments
are marked to market. Estimated fair value generally represents market value. Cost or amortized cost is used to
approximate fair value for certain short-term investments
not traded in the market (time deposits, etc.). Realized gains
and losses are included in income from investments and are
measured by the difference between average cost or amortized cost and the net proceeds of sales.

Loans

ADB's loans are made to or guaranteed by members, with
the exception of loans to the private sector, and have maturities ranging between 4 and 30 years. ADB requires its
borrowers to absorb exchange risks attributable to fluctuations in the value of the currencies which it has disbursed.
It is the policy of ADB to place in nonaccrual status loans for
which principal, interest, or other charges are overdue by
six months. Interest and other charges on nonaccruing loans
are included in income only to the extent that payments
have actually been received by ADB. ADB follows a policy of
not taking part in debt rescheduling agreements with respect to public sector loans. In the case of private sector
loans, ADB may agree to debt rescheduling only after alternative courses of action have been exhausted.

ADB determines that a loan is impaired and therefore
subject to provisioning when principal or interest is in arrears for one year for public sector loans made to or guaranteed by a member (unless there is clear and convincing
evidence warranting the deferment or acceleration of such
provisioning) and six months for private sector loans. If the
present value of expected future cash flows discounted at
the loan's effective interest rate is less than the carrying
value of the loan, a valuation allowance is established with
a corresponding charge to provision for possible losses.

OCR-8

CONTINUED

ADB's periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance
for possible losses is based on its past loan loss experience,
known and inherent risks in existing loans, and adverse
situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay.

Equity Investments

Investments in equity securities without readily determinable
fair values are reported at cost less an allowance for possible losses.

Provisions for possible loss of value are established
quarterly based on Management's evaluation of potential
losses for such investments. Equity securities with readily
determinable fair values are reported at fair value, with
unrealized gains and losses excluded from net income and
reported in “CAPITAL AND RESERVES” as part of “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” ADB applies the equity
method of accounting to one investment where it has the
ability to exercise significant influence.

Property, Furniture, and Equipment

Property, furniture, and equipment are stated at cost and,
except for land, depreciated over estimated useful lives on
a straight-line basis. Maintenance, repairs, and minor betterments are charged to expense.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent liabilities at the end of the year and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. The
actual results could differ from those estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, ADB con
siders that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to “DUE
FROM BANKS.”184 ANNUAL REPORT 1999

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors. The main investment
management objective is to maintain security and liquidity.
Subject to these parameters, ADB seeks the highest possible
return on its investments.

In 1999, the Board of Directors approved a new Investment Authority. The new Investment Authority allows investment in higher-yielding investment instruments, such
as high-quality corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities.

ADB is restricted by its Investment Authority to invest in
(a) securities which are obligations of a limited class of
issuers, primarily government or government-guaranteed
obligations, multilateral banks, and selected commercial
banks; and (b) exchange-traded derivatives of such securities.Financial Statements 185

 

Exposure to interest rate risk may be adjusted within defined bands to reflect changing market circumstances. These
adjustments are made through the purchase and sale of
both securities and exchange-traded financial futures and
options. The use of options has been minimal and there
were no outstanding options as of 31 December 1999 (nil 1998). To increase returns, ADB may invest in securities
denominated in currencies other than the originating functional currencies and then enter into covered forward foreign
exchange agreements in order to maintain its original mix
of functional currency holdings. Accordingly, the financial
futures, options, and covered forwards are held for risk
management rather than for trading purposes.

Futures: Futures are contracts for delayed delivery of
securities or money market instruments in which the seller
agrees to make delivery at a specified future date of a
specified instrument at a specified price or yield. Initial
margin requirements are met with cash or securities, and
changes in the market prices are settled daily. Changes in
the market value of open futures contracts are recognized
as gains or losses in the period of the change and included
in income from investments. At 31 December 1999, there
were no outstanding purchase nor sales contracts (nil —
1998).

Covered forwards: Covered forwards are agreements in which
cash in one currency is converted into a different currency
and simultaneously a forward exchange agreement is executed providing for a future exchange of the two currencies

in order to recover the currency converted. ADB records the
covered forward as an investment in the underlying currency.
A receivable is created for the forward contract of the originating currency and a payable for the underlying instrument
to be converted into the originating currency at maturity.
Premiums or discounts are deferred and amortized as adjustments to income from investments over the life of the underlying instrument. No covered forward agreements were
outstanding at 31 December 1999 (nil — 1998).

Short sales: Short sales are sales of securities not held in
ADB's portfolio at the time of the sale. ADB must purchase
the security at a later date and bears the risk that the market
value of the security will move adversely between the time
of the sale and the time the security must be delivered. The
payable created upon entering into a short sale is stated at
the market value of the security subject to the short sale and
gains and losses resulting from changes in market value are
included in income from investments in the period of the
change. Short sales are used by ADB for adjusting the risk
exposure of the investment portfolio and for establishing
spread positions to enhance income. As of 31 December
1999, there was no open short sale position (nil — 1998).

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1999 and 1998

Prior to 1 July 1986, the lending rate of ADB was based on
a multicurrency fixed lending rate system under which loans
carried interest rates fixed at the time of loan approval for
the entire life of the loans. Effective 1 July 1986, ADB adopted
a multicurrency pool-based variable lending rate system. In
addition, in July 1992, ADB introduced a pool-based variable United States dollar lending system, and in November
1994, a market-based variable lending system was made
available to financial intermediaries in the public sector and
to the private sector. For loans to the private sector, approximately 72% (71% — 1998) of the loans were based on
a variable interest rate.

Undisbursed loan commitments and an analysis of loans
by borrowing member countries as of 31 December 1999 are

Public Sector Loans

The fair value of loans outstanding to or guaranteed by
members with interest rates which vary based on the poolbased variable lending rate system were determined using
the entry value method. Under this method, fair value was
determined based on the terms at which a similar loan would
currently be made by ADB to a similar borrower. For such
loans, fair value approximated the carrying amount. For undisbursed balances of effective loans and for loans not yet
effective, the contractual amount approximated fair value.

The fair value of loans outstanding to or guaranteed by
members with fixed interest rates (principally loans made
prior to 1 July 1986) were determined using a discounted
cash flow method. This method takes into account the
scheduled cash flows over the average life, by currency, of
the loans, and current funding costs for the average life,
including a factor for administrative costs.

The estimated fair value of loans to or guaranteed by
members was not affected by credit risks based on ADB's
experience with its borrowers.

Two public sector loans to Myanmar were in nonaccrual
status as of 31 December 1999 (two — 1998). The principal
outstanding and overdue at that date was $929,000 ($935,000
— 1998). Loans in nonaccrual status resulted in $68,000
($68,000 — 1998) not being recognized as income from public
sector loans for the year ended 31 December 1999. The
accumulated interest and other charges that are not recognized as income on these loans would have totaled $139,000
($70,000 — 1998).

Private Sector Loans

The fair value of loans outstanding to the private sector
were determined using a discounted cash flow method.

Eleven private sector loans were in nonaccrual status as
of 31 December 1999 (seven — 1998). The principal outstanding at that date was $72,048,000 ($51,609,000 — 1998)
of which $30,770,000 ($17,752,000 — 1998) was overdue.
Loans in nonaccrual status resulted in $6,289,000 ($5,226,000
— 1998) not being recognized in income from private sector
loans for the year ended 31 December 1999. The accumulated interest and other charges on these loans that are not
recognized would have totaled $13,033,000 ($6,665,000 —
1998).Financial Statements 187

 

Loan Loss Provision

ADB has not suffered any losses of principal on loans made
to or guaranteed by members. No loan loss provisions have
been made against loans outstanding to or guaranteed by
members, but loan loss provisions have been made against
private sector loans during the year (See Note K).

Loan Guarantees and Cofinancings

ADB extends guarantees for the benefit of its members which
are not reflected in the financial statements. Such guarantees
include partial credit guarantees where only certain principal
and/or interest payments are covered. Such guaranteed payments
are generally due 10 or more years from the loan inception date.
The present value of the contingent future payment obligations
of all outstanding guarantees at 31 December 1999 and 1998 is
used to calculate ADB's lending limitation. None of these

NOTE G—PROPERTY, FURNITURE, AND EQUIPMENT

In 1991, under the terms of an agreement with the Philippines (Government), ADB returned the former headquarters
premises which had been provided by the Government. In
accordance with the agreement as supplemented by a memorandum of understanding, ADB was compensated $22,657,000
for the return of these premises. The compensation is in lieu
of being provided premises under the agreement and accordingly, is deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the
new headquarters building as a reduction of occupancy expense. The amortization for the years ended 31 December
1999 and 1998 amounted to $566,000 reducing depreciation
expense for the new headquarters building for 1999 and 1998
from $4,700,000 to $4,134,000. At 31 December 1999, the
unamortized deferred compensation balance (included in
“ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES — Miscellaneous”) was $17,608,000 ($18,174,000 — 1998). At 31 December 1999, accumulated depreciation for property, furniture,
and equipment was $69,910,000 ($61,396,000 — 1998).

NOTE H—BORROWINGS AND SWAPS

ADB uses derivative financial instruments in connection with
its borrowing activities to diversify its funding sources across
public and private debt markets, currencies and instruments.
Currency swaps are used to convert a currency borrowed
under advantageous terms into one of ADB’s major operational currencies, taking advantage of the opportunities offered in different financial markets. Such currency swaps
enable ADB to raise operationally needed currencies in aFinancial Statements 189

 

cost-efficient way and to maintain its borrowing presence in
the major capital markets. Interest rate swaps are used generally to reduce balance sheet interest rate mismatches arising from lending operations.

ADB issues structured debt which includes embedded
currency and/or interest rate derivatives in order to decrease its cost of borrowing. However, ADB enters into
simultaneous currency and/or interest rate swaps to hedge
fully against the effects of such embedded derivatives.

ADB has a potential risk of loss if the swap counterparty
fails to perform its obligations (see Note O). In order to
reduce such credit risk, ADB only enters into long-term
swap transactions with counterparties eligible under ADB's
swap guidelines which include a requirement that the
counterparties have a credit rating of double A or higher.
ADB does not anticipate that any of its counterparties will
fail to perform their obligations under such agreements.

Interest rate swaps: Under a typical interest rate swap
agreement used by ADB, one party agrees to make periodic
payments based on a notional principal amount and an
interest rate that is fixed at the outset of the agreement. The
counterparty agrees to make floating rate payments based
on the same notional principal amount. Amounts receivable
or payable under the terms of the swap are accrued over the
period to which the payment relates and the related cost or

The terms of ADB's interest rate swap agreements specifically match the terms of particular borrowings.

Currency swaps: Under a typical currency swap agreement,
one party agrees to make periodic payments in one currency
while the counterparty agrees to make periodic payments in
another currency. The payments may be fixed at the outset
of the agreement or vary based on interest rates. A receivable
is created for the currency swapped out, and a payable is
created for the currency swapped in. Swap premiums and
discounts are deferred and amortized into interest and other
financial expenses over the life of the underlying instruments. The terms of ADB's currency swap agreements specifically match the terms of particular borrowings.

The fair value of borrowings outstanding is estimated
using prevailing market prices where available, or estimated
replacement values where market prices are not available.

The fair value of outstanding currency and interest rate
swap agreements are determined at the estimated amount
that ADB would receive or pay to terminate the agreements
based upon market quotes from dealers.

are “callable” and 243,753 (242,475 — 1998) are “paid-in.”
The “callable” share capital is subject to call by ADB only as
and when required to meet ADB's obligations incurred on
borrowings of funds for inclusion in its ordinary capital
resources or on guarantees chargeable to such resources.
The “paid-in” share capital has been paid or is payable in
installments, partly in convertible currencies and partly in
the currency of the subscribing member which may be convertible. In accordance with Article 6, paragraph 3 of the
Charter, ADB accepts nonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing
demand obligations in satisfaction of the portion payable in
the currency of the member, provided such currency is not
required by ADB for the conduct of its operations. The
settlement of such amounts is not determinable and, accordingly, it is not practicable to determine a fair value for
these receivables.

As of 31 December 1999, all matured installments amounting to $3,187,229,000 ($3, 169,579,000 — 1998) were received,
except for $1,814,000 ($5,964,000 — 1998) from two countries
(five — 1998). Installments not due aggregating $160,426,000
($244,542,000 — 1998) are receivable as follows:

Year ending 31 December:

2000 $78,137,000 2002
2001 65,869,000

$16,420,000

Payments in respect of capital subscription installments
in advance of due dates are shown in the balance sheet
(under the caption “ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER
LIABILITIES”) as “Advance payments on subscriptions” pending the determination of the full value of such payments
based on the rate of exchange to be used by ADB as of the
date on which such payments are actually due.

Capital Transferred to Asian Development Fund

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1(i) of
the Charter, the Board of Governors has authorized the
setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired “paid-in” capital
paid by members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(a) of the
Charter and of the convertible currency portion paid by
members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(b) of the Charter as of 28 April 1973 to be used as a part of the special
funds of ADB. The resources so set aside amounting to
$65,386,000 as of 31 December 1999 ($67,036,000 — 1998)
expressed in terms of the SDR on the basis of $1.37338
($1.40803 — 1998) per SDR ($57,434,000 in terms of $1.20635
per 1966 dollar—see Note B), were allocated and transferred to the Asian Development Fund.

Maintenance of Value of Currency Holdings

Prior to 1 April 1978, the effective date of the Second Amendment to the IMF Articles, ADB implemented maintenance of
value in respect of holdings of member currencies in terms of
1966 dollars, in accordance with the provisions of Article 25
of the Charter and relevant resolutions of the Board of Directors. The “Amounts required to maintain value of currency
holdings” under “RECEIVABLE FROM MEMBERS" represent
the aggregate amounts receivable resulting from changes in
exchange rates of member currencies from those previously
used for the purpose of computing maintenance of value of
ADB's holdings of certain member currencies. The settlement
of such amounts is not determinable and, accordingly, it is
not practicable to determine a fair value for these receivables.

Since 1 April 1978, inasmuch as the valuation of ADB’s
capital stock and the basis of determining possible maintenance of value obligations are still under consideration,
notional amounts have been calculated provisionally as
receivable from or payable to members in order to maintain
the value of currency holdings in terms of the SDR. The
timing of any establishment and settlement of such amounts
is uncertain and, accordingly, it is not practicable to determine a fair value for such receivables and payables. The
notional amounts as of 31 December 1999 consisting of
receivables of $708,431,000 ($718,693,000 — 1998) and
payables of $340,351,000 ($247,931,000 — 1998) consist of
(a) the increase of $369,650,000 ($423,006,000 — 1998) in
amounts required to maintain the value of currency holdings to the extent of matured and paid capital subscriptions
due to the increase in the value of the SDR in relation to theFinancial Statements 191

 

United States dollar during the period from | April 1978 to
31 December 1999 and (b) the net increase of $1,570,000
(decrease of $47,756,000 — 1998) in the value of such currency holdings in relation to the United States dollar during
the same period.

Membership

As of 31 December 1999, ADB is owned by 58 member
countries, 42 countries from the region and 16 countries
from outside the region (see OCR-7). During 1999, the Board
of Governors approved the membership application of
Azerbaijan. As at 31 December 1999, Azerbaijan has subscribed to 15,736 shares (10,134 shares by Tajikistan —
1998) of ADB’s capital stock and remitted the required paidin portion of its subscription.

NOTE J—RESERVES
Ordinary Reserve and Net Income

Under the provisions of Article 40 of the Charter, the Board
of Governors shall determine annually what part of the net
income shall be allocated, after making provision for reserves,
to surplus and what part, if any, shall be distributed to the
members. During 1999, $464,257,000 of the net income
after appropriation of guarantee fees to Special Reserve for
the year ended 31 December 1998 was allocated to the
Ordinary Reserve, ($367,458,000 to Ordinary Reserve and
$100,000,000 to Surplus - 1998) and $80,000,000
($80,000,000 — 1998) was allocated to Technical Assistance
Special Fund from Surplus.

The restatement of the capital stock for purposes of these
financial statements on the basis of the SDR instead of the
1966 dollar (see Note B) resulted in a net credit of $13,514,000
to the Ordinary Reserve during the year ended 31 December
1999 (charge of $23,785,000 — 1998). That credit is the decrease
in the value of the matured and paid capital subscriptions
caused by the change during the year in the value of the SDR
in relation to the United States dollar not allocated to members as notional maintenance of value adjustments in
accordance with resolutions of the Board of Directors.

Special Reserve

The Special Reserve includes commissions on loans and
guarantee fees on guarantees set aside pursuant to Article

OCR-8

CONTINUED

17 of the Charter. Special Reserve assets consist of term
deposits and government and government-guaranteed obligations and are included under the heading “INVESTMENTS.”
For the year ended 31 December 1999, the net refund of
guarantee fees of $1,553,000 due to the non-utilization of
the full amount of guarantee under the Cofinancing Facility
Agreement with Thailand resulted in a net charge to guarantee fees of $896,000. Accordingly, no amount was appropriated to Special Reserve for 1999 ($2,639,000 — 1998).

Surplus

During 1999, the Board of Governors allocated $80,000,000
($80,000,000 — 1998) out of Surplus to Technical Assistance
Special Fund. Surplus represents funds for future use to be
determined by the Board of Governors.

Comprehensive Income and Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income

In 1998, ADB adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 130—Reporting Comprehensive Income issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components (revenues, expenses, gains, and losses) in a full set of
general-purpose financial statements. Comprehensive income
has two major components: net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes such
items as unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities and listed equity investments, as well as foreign
currency translation adjustments.

NOTE K—INCOME AND EXPENSES

Total income from loans for the year ended 31 December
1999 was $1,674,635,000 ($1,440,929,000 — 1998). The average
yield on the loan portfolio during the year was 6.41% (6.78%
— 1998).

Total income from investments for the year ended
31 December 1999 was $343,951,000 ($382,864,000 —
1998). The annualized rate of return on the average investments held during the year, based on the portfolio held at
the beginning and end of each month, excluding unrealized gains and losses, was 3.93% (5.27% — 1998). If unrealized gains and losses were included, the annualized rate
of return would have been 3.51% (5.32% — 1998).192 ANNUAL REPORT 1999

approved during the year. Of the total administrative expenses of $201,433,000 ($193,176,000 — 1998), $95,528,000
($71,475,000 — 1998) was accordingly charged to the Asian
Development Fund.

For the year ended 31 December 1999, the provision for
possible losses totaled $24,834,000 ($14,047,000 for private
sector loans and $10,787,000 for equity investments). For
the year ended 31 December 1998, the provision for losses

NOTE M—STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN AND
POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS

Staff Retirement Plan

ADB has a contributory defined benefit Staff Retirement
Plan (the Plan). Every employee, as defined under the Plan,
shall, as a condition of service, become a participant from
the first day of service, provided that at such a date, the
employee has not reached the normal retirement age of 60.
The Plan applies also to members of the Board of Directors
who elect to join the Plan. Retirement benefits are based on
length of service and highest average remuneration during
two years of eligible service. The Plan assets are segregated
and are not included in the accompanying balance sheet.
The costs of administering the Plan are absorbed by ADB,
except for fees paid to the investment managers and related
charges, including custodian fees, which are borne by the
Plan.

Participants are required to contribute 9 1/3% of their
salary to the Plan and may also make voluntary contributions. ADB's contribution is determined at a rate sufficient
to cover that part of the costs of the Plan not covered by the
participants’ contributions.

Postretirement Medical Benefits Plan

In 1993, ADB adopted a cost-sharing plan for retirees’ medical
insurance premiums. Under the plan, ADB is obligated to
pay 80% of the Group Medical Insurance Plan premiums for
retirees, including retired members of the Board of Directors, and their eligible dependents who elected to participate. The cost-sharing plan is currently unfunded.

Generally accepted accounting principles require an actuarially determined assessment of the periodic cost of
postretirement medical benefits.Financial Statements 193

Additional fair value information, including methods used
to estimate certain values, is included in the notes referenced in the above table.

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the
amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a
current transaction between willing parties, other than in a
forced or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are shortterm approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily require the use of
subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which
such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current
transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not determinable.196 ANNUAL REPORT 1999

NOTE O—OFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT RISK

ADB is a party to off-balance sheet financial instruments.
These financial instruments involve elements of credit risk
in excess of amounts reflected on the balance sheet. Credit
risk represents the maximum potential accounting loss due
to possible nonperformance by obligors and counterparties
under the terms of the contract.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1999 and 1998

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Asian Development Fund (the Fund) was established on
28 June 1974 to more effectively carry out the special operations of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) by providing
resources on concessional terms which are made available
almost exclusively to the least developed borrowing countries.

The resources of the Fund have been subsequently augmented by six replenishments, the most recent of which
became effective in September 1997 in a total amount equivalent to US$2,657,777,000 to cover the operational requirements for the four-year period from January 1997. In 1997,
unallocated net income of $230,000,000 held in the surplus
account of ADB's Ordinary Capital Resources was allocated
to the Fund to supplement donors’ contributions.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of contributing member countries are functional currencies. The reporting currency is the United States
dollar, and the financial statements are expressed in thousands of current United States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, amounts available for loan commitments
and advance payments on contributions are translated from
their functional currencies to the reporting currency, generally
at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting
period. Revenue and expense amounts are translated for
each semimonthly period, generally at the applicable rates
of exchange at the beginning of each period; such practice
approximates the application of average rates in effect during the period. Translation adjustments relating to set-aside
resources (see Note G) are recorded as notional amounts
receivable from or payable to Ordinary Capital Resources.
Other translation adjustments are charged or credited to
“Accumulated translation adjustments” and reported in “UNEXPENDED BALANCES AND CAPITAL” as part of “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” Exchange gains or losses
on currency transactions among functional currencies are
included in revenue.

CONTINUED

Investments

All investment securities held by the Fund are considered by
Management to be available for sale and are reported at
estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from revenue and reported in “UNEXPENDED
BALANCES AND CAPITAL” as part of “Accumulated other
comprehensive income.” Estimated fair value generally represents market value. Cost or amortized cost is used to
approximate fair value for certain short-term investments
not traded in the market (time deposits, etc.). Realized gains
and losses are included in revenue from investments and
are measured by the difference between average cost or
amortized cost and the net proceeds of sales.

Loans

It is the policy of the Fund to place in nonaccrual status
loans made to eligible developing member countries if the
principal or interest with respect to any such loans are
overdue by six months. Interest on nonaccruing loans are
included in revenue only to the extent that payments have
actually been received by the Fund. ADB follows a policy of
not taking part in debt rescheduling agreements with respect to public sector loans. In the case of private sector
loans, ADB may agree to debt rescheduling only after alternative courses of action have been exhausted.

ADB determines that a loan is impaired and, therefore,
subject to provisioning when principal or interest are in
arrears for one year for public sector loans made to or
guaranteed by a member country (unless there is clear and
convincing evidence warranting the deferment or acceleration of such provisioning) and six months for private sector
loans. If the present value of expected future cash flows
discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate is less than
the carrying value of the loan, a valuation allowance is
established with a corresponding charge to provision for
possible losses.

ADB's periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1999 and 1998

Contributed Resources

Contributions by member countries are included in the
financial statements as amounts committed from the date
Instruments of Contribution are deposited and related formalities are completed.

Contributions are generally paid or to be paid in the
currency of the contributor either in cash or notes.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires Management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of the year and
the reported amounts of income and expenses during the
year. The actual results could differ from those estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Fund
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS.”

gains and losses, was 3.99% (4.56% — 1998). If unrealized
gains and losses were included, the annualized rate of return would have been 3.75% (4.67% — 1998).

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors. The main investment
management objective is to maintain security and liquidity.
Subject to these parameters, ADB seeks the highest possible
return on the Fund's investments.

In 1999, the Board of Directors approved a new Investment
Authority. The new Investment Authority allows investment
in higher-yielding investment instruments, such as high-Financial Statements 207

 

quality corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and
asset-backed securities.

NOTE D—LOANS AND LOAN LOSS PROVISION
Loans

Prior to 1 January 1999, loans of the Fund were extended to
eligible developing member countries, which bore a service
charge of 1% and required repayment over periods ranging
from 35 to 40 years. On 14 December 1998, the Board of
Directors approved an amendment to ADF loan terms, as
follows: (i) for loans to finance specific projects, 32-year
maturity including an 8-year grace period; (ii) program loans
to support sector development, 24-year maturity including
an 8-year grace period; and (iii) all new loans bear a 1%
interest charge during the grace period, and 1.5% during the
amortization period, with equal amortization. The new ADF
lending terms took effect on 1 January 1999 and apply only
to new loans for which formal loan negotiations were completed on or after 1 January 1999. The Fund requires borrowers to absorb exchange risks attributable to fluctuations
in the value of the currencies disbursed.

The fair value of loans are determined using an entry
value method. Under this method, fair value is determined
based on the terms at which a similar loan would currently
be made by ADB to a similar borrower. For such loans, fair
value approximates the carrying amount. The estimated fair
value of loans is not affected by credit risks because the
amount of any such adjustment is not considered to have a
material effect based on ADB’s experience with its borrowers.

Undisbursed loan commitments and an analysis of loans
by countries as of 31 December 1999 are shown in ADF-5.

The principal amount outstanding of public sector loans
in nonaccrual status as of 31 December 1999 was $535, 727,000
($492,379,000 — 1998) of which $40,152,000 ($22,253,000 —
1998) was overdue. Loans in nonaccrual status resulted in
$5,045,000 ($5,740,000 — 1998) not being recognized as income
from loans for the year ended 31 December 1999. The loans
in nonaccrual status as of 31 December 1999 were four loans
made to Afghanistan and 28 loans to Myanmar. (Four loans
to Afghanistan and 27 loans to Myanmar were in nonaccrual
status as of 31 December 1998). The accumulated interest
that are not recognized as income on these loans would have
totaled $12,877,000 ($6,960,000 - 1998).

Private sector loans outstanding as of 31 December
1999 were $7,778,000 ($13,885,000 — 1998), net of accumu
ADF-7

CONTINUED

lated provision for possible loan losses as of 31 December
1999 of $2,986,000 ($2,324,000 — 1998), and there were no
undisbursed loan commitments (nil — 1998).

Loan Loss Provision

ADB makes provision for possible losses on loans to the
private sector, based on an evaluation by ADB of the
collectibility of loans outstanding.

ADB makes provision for possible losses on loans made
to the public sector when principal or interest is in arrears
for a year or more unless there is clear and convincing
evidence warranting the deferment or acceleration of such
provisioning. The amount of any loss provision is determined by comparing the carrying value of the loan to the
present value of expected cash inflows discounted at the
loan's effective interest rate.

During the 1999 financial year, no loan loss provisions
(nil — 1998) were made against public sector loans while
$469,000 ($822,000 — 1998) has been provided against private sector loans.

Information pertaining to loans which are subject to
loan loss provisions as at 31 December 1999 and 1998 is as
follows:

1999 1998

Loans without

Against private sector
loans 2,986,000 2,324,000
Total 6,929,000 $6,267,000

NOTE E—NOTES OF CONTRIBUTORS

Notes of contributors are nonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing and, subject to certain restrictions imposed by applicable Board of Governors’ resolutions encashable by ADB at
par upon demand.

ADB currently expects that the notes outstanding at 31
December 1999 will be encashed in varying amounts over
the eight-year period ending 31 December 2007.

The fair value of notes of contributors are determined
using an entry value method whereby fair value is determined, based on the terms at which notes are currently
being accepted from contributors. On this basis, the fair
value of outstanding notes of contributors approximates
their carrying amount.

NOTE F—ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND
ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

Administrative expenses include an administration charge
from Ordinary Capital Resources amounting to $95,528,000
($71,475,000 — 1998). The charge represents an apportionment of all administrative expenses of ADB (other than
those pertaining directly to ordinary operations and special
operations), based on the number of loans and equity investments approved during the year.

NOTE G—SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1 (i) of
the Articles of Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter), the Board of Governors has
authorized the setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired
“paid-in” capital paid by member countries pursuant to
Article 6, paragraph 2(a) of the Charter and of the
convertible currency portion paid by member countries
pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(b) of the Charter as of
28 April 1973, to be used as a part of the Special Funds
of ADB. The capital so set aside was allocated and
transferred from the Ordinary Capital Resources to the
Fund as Set-Aside Resources.

The capital stock of ADB is defined in Article 4, paragraph
1 of the Charter, “in terms of United States dollars of the
weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966” (the 1966
dollar). Therefore, Set-Aside Resources had historically been
translated into the current United States dollar (ADB’s unit
of account), on the basis of its par value in terms of gold.
From 1973 until 31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on this
basis was $1.20635 per 1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at
which time the Second Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into
effect, currencies no longer had par values in terms of gold.
Pending ADB's selection of the appropriate successor to the
1966 dollar, the Set-Aside Resources have been valued for
purposes of the accompanying financial statements in terms
of the Special Drawing Right (SDR), at the value in current
United States dollars as computed by the IMF. As of 31
December 1999, the value of the SDR in terms of the current
United States dollar was $1.37338 ($1.40803 - 1998). On
this basis, Set-Aside Resources amounted to $65,386,000
($67,036,000 - 1998). If the capital stock of ADB as of 31
December 1999 had been valued in terms of $12,063.50 per
share, Set-Aside Resources would have been $57,434,000.

NOTE H—COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND ACCUMULATED
OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

In 1998, ADB adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 130—Reporting Comprehensive Income issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components (revenues, expenses, gains, and losses) in a full set of
general-purpose financial statements. Comprehensive incomeFinancial Statements 209

 

has two major components: net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income include such
items as unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities and foreign currency translation adjustments.

NOTE I—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are shortterm approximates their carrying amounts.

ADF-7

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily require the use of
subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which
such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current
transaction, or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not determinable.

The Fund's balance sheet carrying amounts are considered to approximate fair values for all significant financial
instruments. See Notes B, C, D, and E for discussions with
respect to investments, loans, and notes of contributors,
respectively.210

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Asian Development Bank

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of financial position and the related
statements of activities and changes in net assets and of cash flows present fairly, in
all material respects, in terms of United States dollars, the financial position of the
Asian Development Bank—Technical Assistance Special Fund at 31 December 1999
and 1998, and the results of its activities and changes in net assets and its cash flows
for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the management of the Asian
Development Bank; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
‘An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion
expressed above.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The accompanying statement of resources as
al 31 December 1999 and summary statement of technical assistance approved and
effective for the year ended 31 December 1999 are presented for purposes of additional analyses and are not required parts of the basic financial statements. Such
information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the
basic financial statements and in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects
in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1999 and 1998

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) was established to provide technical assistance on a grant basis to
developing member countries of the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) and for regional technical assistance. TASF
resources consist of direct voluntary contributions by members, allocations from the net income of Ordinary Capital
Resources (OCR) and Asian Development Fund (ADF) contributions, and revenue from investments and other sources.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statements of the TASF are presented on the
basis of unrestricted and temporarily restricted net assets.

TASF reports contributed cash and other assets as restricted support if they are received with donor stipulations
that limit the use of the donated assets. When a donor
restriction expires, that is, when a stipulated time or purpose restriction is accomplished, temporarily restricted net
assets are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and reported in the Statement of Activities and Changes in Net
Assets as net assets released from restrictions.

Investments

All investment securities held by TASF are reported at estimated fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and
losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value generally
represents market value. Cost or amortized cost is used to
approximate fair value for certain short-term investments
not traded in the market (time deposits, etc.).

Contributions

Contributions from members are included in the financial
statements from the date contribution agreements become
effective. Contributions from donors which are restricted by
them to technical assistance (TA) projects/programs with
specified procurement sources are classified as temporarily
restricted contributions. Those without any stipulations as
to specific use are accounted for as unrestricted contributions.

Technical Assistance to Member Countries

Technical assistance is recognized in the financial statements when the related project is approved and becomes
effective. Upon completion of the TA project, any undisbursed amount is written back as a reduction in Technical
Assistance for the period and the corresponding undisbursed commitment is eliminated accordingly.

Reporting Currency

The financial statements of TASF are expressed in thousands
of current United States dollars. As a matter of convenience,
the United States dollar is the functional and reporting currency and is used to measure exchange gains and losses.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, and uncommitted balances in currencies
other than United States dollars are translated at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period.
Contributions included in the financial statements during
the year are recognized at applicable exchange rates as of
the respective dates of commitment. Revenue and expense
amounts in currencies other than United States dollars are
translated for each semimonthly period generally at the
applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period;
such practice approximates the application of average rates
in effect during the period. Translation adjustments are
accounted for as exchange gains or losses and are charged
or credited to operations.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of
the year and the reported amounts of income and expenses
during the year. The actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the TASF

considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS.”Financial Statements 217

 

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS

The currency compositions of the investment portfolio as of
31 December 1999 and 1998 expressed in United States
dollars were as follows:

Currency 1999 1998
Australian dollar $ 5,757,000 $ 5,299,000
Canadian dollar 128,083,000 85,137,000
Deutsche mark - 6,103,000
Euro 60,886,000 Italian lira - 5,032,000
Netherlands guilder - 2,542,000
Swiss franc 17,924,000 72,884,000
Others 3,509,000 6,080,000

Total $216,159,000 $183,077,000

The annualized rate of return on the average investments
held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the
beginning and end of each month was 3.50% (4.10% — 1998).

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors. The main investment
management objective is to maintain security and liquidity.
Subject to these parameters, ADB seeks the highest possible
return on TASF investments.

In 1999, the Board of Directors approved a new Investment
Authority. The new Investment Authority allows investment
in higher-yielding investment instruments, such as highquality corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and
asset-backed securities.

NOTE D—FUNDING

Since inception in 1967, direct contributions have been made
by 29 member countries. In 1986 and 1992, the Board of
Governors, in authorizing a replenishment of the ADF, provided for an allocation to the TASF in an aggregate amount
equivalent to $72,000,000 and $140,000,000, respectively, to
be used for technical assistance to ADF borrowing developing member countries and for regional technical assistance.

In addition, an aggregate amount equivalent to
$421,000,000 has been allocated to TASF out of OCR in
1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1998, and 1999.

Some of the direct contributions received were subject
to restricted procurement sources, while some were given

TASF-6

on condition that the Technical Assistance be made on a
reimbursable basis.

The total contributions received for the years ended
31 December 1999 and 1998 were without restrictions.

NOTE E—UNDISBURSED COMMITMENTS

Undisbursed commitments are denominated in United States
dollars and represent effective ongoing grant-financed TA
projects/programs which are not yet disbursed as of the end
of the year. During 1999, an amount of $7,038,000
($15,557,000 — 1998) representing completed and canceled
TA projects has been written back as a reduction in Technical Assistance of the period and the corresponding undisbursed commitment has been eliminated. The fair value of
undisbursed commitments approximates the amounts undisbursed because ADB expects that grants will be made for
all projects/programs covered by the commitments. When
TA provided as a project preparatory grant leads to an ADB
loan, the amount of the grant exceeding $250,000 will be
refunded by the borrower through the loan proceeds under
the terms of that ADB loan. Refinanced amounts of $296,000
($714,000 — 1998) were charged to such loans and credited
to revenue from other sources of the TASF during the
year ended 31 December 1999.

NOTE F—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are shortterm approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily require the use of
subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which
such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current
transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not determinable.

The Fund's statement of financial position carrying
amounts are considered to approximate fair values for all
significant financial instruments. See Notes B and E for
discussions with respect to investments and undisbursed
commitments, respectively.218 ANNUAL REPORT 1999

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Asian Development Bank

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of financial position and the related
statements of activities and changes in net assets and of cash flows present fairly, in
all material respects, in terms of United States dollars, the financial position of the
Asian Development Bank—Japan Special Fund at 31 December 1999 and 1998, and
the results of its activities and changes in net assets and its cash flows for the years
then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the management of the Asian Development Bank; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—JAPAN SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1999 and 1998

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Japan Special Fund (JSF) was established in March 1988
when Japan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) entered
into a financial arrangement whereby Japan agreed to make
an initial contribution and ADB became the administrator.
The purpose of JSF is to help developing member countries
(DMCs) of ADB restructure their economies and broaden the
scope of opportunities for new investments, thereby assisting the recycling of funds to DMCs of ADB. While the JSF
resources are used mainly to finance technical assistance
(TA) operations, these resources may also be used for equity
investment operations in ADB's DMCs. Under the agreement
between ADB and Japan, ADB may invest the proceeds of JSF
pending disbursement. The revenue from such investments,
if retained by ADB, may only be used to pay for direct and
identifiable costs incurred in the administration of JSF.

In March 1999, the Board approved the acceptance and
administration by ADB of a new facility, the Asian Currency
Crisis Support Facility (ACCSF) to assist Asian currency crisisaffected member countries (CAMCs). Funded by Japan, ACCSF
was established within the Japan Special Fund (JSF) to assist
in the economic recovery of CAMCs through interest payment
assistance (IPA) grants, TA grants and guarantees. ACCSF
funds must be committed within three years after the date
the facility became effective. Thereafter, the use of any
residual funds, if and when the purpose of ACCSF is considered to be fulfilled, shall be decided in consultation
between ADB and Japan.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statements of the JSF are presented on the
basis of unrestricted and temporarily restricted net assets.
ACCSF funds are separately reported in the financial
statements.

JSF reports the contributions of cash and other assets as
restricted support if they are received with donor stipulations that limit the use of the donated assets. When the
donor restriction expires, that is, when a stipulated time or
purpose restriction is accomplished, temporarily restricted
net assets are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and
reported in the Statement of Activities and Changes in Net
Assets as net assets released from restrictions.

Investments

All investment securities held by the JSF are reported at
estimated fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and
losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value generally
represents market value. Cost or amortized cost is used to
approximate fair value for certain short-term investments
not traded in the market (time deposits, etc.).

Contributions

Contributions by Japan are included in the financial statements
from the date indicated by Japan that funds are expected to
be made available. Contributions which are restricted by the
donor for specific TA projects/programs or for IPA grants are
classified as temporarily restricted contributions. Those without
any stipulation as to specific use are accounted for as
unrestricted contributions and reported as such.

Technical Assistance and Interest Payment Assistance

Technical assistance and interest payment assistance are
recognized in the financial statements when the related project
or assistance is approved and becomes effective. Upon completion of the TA project, any undisbursed amount is written
back as a reduction in TA for the period and the corresponding undisbursed commitment is eliminated, accordingly.

Functional Currency and Reporting Currency

The functional currency of JSF is the Japanese yen, while the
reporting currency is the United States dollar. The financial
statements are expressed in thousands of current United
States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, and uncommitted balances are translated
from the functional currency to the reporting currency at
the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting
period. Contributions included in the financial statements
during the year are translated at the applicable exchange
rates as of the respective dates of commitment. Revenue
and expense amounts in Japanese yen are translated for
each semimonthly period at the applicable rates of exchange
at the beginning of each period; such practice approximates
the application of average rates in effect during the period.Financial Statements 223

 

Exchange gains or losses on currency transactions arise on
translation differences between the date a project/program
is committed and the timing of disbursements. Exchange
gains or losses are charged or credited to operations.

Equity Investments

Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are
reported at fair value. ADB makes provisions for possible
loss of value quarterly based on Management's evaluation
of potential losses on investments without readily determinable fair values.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires

JSF-4

CONTINUED

Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end
of the year and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the year. The actual results could differ from
those estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the JSF
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS.”

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS

The currency compositions of the investment portfolio as of

31 December 1999 and 1998 expressed in United States
dollars were as follows:

 

 

Currency

Japanese yen

$294,906,000 $411,758,000 $309,782,000

Total $116,852,000

The annualized rates of return on the average investments
held under ACCSF and JSF funds during the year, based on
the portfolio held at the beginning and end of each month
were 0.07% and 5.22%, respectively (5.08% for JSF — 1998).

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors. The main investment
management objective is to maintain security and liquidity.
Subject to these parameters, ADB seeks the highest possible
return on JSF’s investments.

In 1999, the Board of Directors approved a new Investment
Authority. The new Investment Authority allows investment
in higher-yielding investment instruments, such as highquality corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and
asset-backed securities.

NOTE D—EQUITY INVESTMENTS

ADB used JSF resources to make an equity investment in
India in 1990 totaling $709,000 at 31 December 1999

   

($216,000 - 1998). The investment is reported at its estimated fair value and the unrealized gain of $506,000 (loss
of $152,000 - 1998) is included in income for the year.

NOTE E—UNDISBURSED COMMITMENTS

Undisbursed commitments are denominated in United States
dollars and represent effective TA for projects/programs and
IPA grants which have not been disbursed. During 1999, an
amount of $4,779,000 ($9,169,000 - 1998), representing
completed and canceled TA projects, has been written back
as a reduction in TA for the period and the corresponding
undisbursed commitment has been eliminated. The fair value
of undisbursed commitments approximates the amounts
outstanding because JSF expects that disbursements will
substantially be made for all the projects/programs covered
by the commitments.224 ANNUAL REPORT 1999

Accumulated investment income net of accumulated administrative expenses has been categorized as temporarily
restricted net assets because, under the terms of the agreement between ADB and the donor, it may only be used for
defraying of the Fund’s administrative expenses.

Net assets released from restrictions relate to commitments for technical assistance and interest payment assistance satisfying the conditions specified by the donor and,
in the case of accumulated investment income, to defray the
administrative expenses of the Fund.

NOTE H—GUARANTEES

To assist in the economic recovery of CAMCs, a guarantee
facility is provided under ACCSF. In this connection, Japan
has made available a noninterest-bearing, nonnegotiable
note in the amount of ¥360 billion ($3.5 billion),
encashable by ADB at any time to meet any calls on
the guarantee facility. As of 31 December 1999, no guarantee has been made.

NOTE I—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.Financial Statements 225

 

The fair value of financial instruments that are shortterm approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily require the use of
subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which
such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current

JSF-4

transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not determinable.

The Fund's statement of financial position carrying
amounts are considered to approximate fair values for all
significant financial instruments. See Notes B, C, D, and E
for discussions with respect to investments, equity investments, and undisbursed commitments, respectively.226 ANNUAL REPORT 1999

statements of activities and changes in net assets, and of cash flows present fairly,
in all material respects in terms of United States dollars, the financial position
of the Asian Development Bank—Asian Development Bank Institute Special Fund
at 31 December 1999 and 1998, and the results of its activities and changes in net
assets and its cash flows for the years ended 31 December 1999 and 1998, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the management of the Asian Development Bank; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statements presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1999 and 1998

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

In 1996, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved
the establishment of the Asian Development Bank Institute (the Institute) in Tokyo, Japan as a subsidiary body
of ADB. The Institute’s operations commenced upon the
receipt of the first funds from Japan on 24 March
1997, and it was inaugurated on 10 December 1997.
The Institute’s funds may consist of voluntary contributions, donations, and grants from ADB member countries, nongovernment organizations, and foundations.
The objectives of the Institute, as defined under its Statute, are the identification of effective development strategies and capacity improvement for sound development
management in developing member countries.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statements of the Institute are presented
on the basis of those for not-for-profit organizations.

The Institute reports donor's contributions of cash
and other assets as unrestricted support as these are
made available to the Institute without conditions other
than for the purposes of pursuing the objectives of the
Institute.

Investments

All investment securities held by the Institute are reported
at estimated fair value, with realized and unrealized
gains and losses included in revenue. Estimated fair
value generally represents market value. Cost or amortized cost is used to approximate fair value for certain
short-term investments not traded in the market (time
deposits, etc.).

Property, Furniture, and Equipment
Property, furniture, and equipment are stated at cost and

depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the
straight-line method.

Contributions

Contributions from donors are included in the financial
statements from the date committed.

Functional Currency and Reporting Currency

The currencies of contributing members are functional
currencies. The reporting currency is the United States
dollar and the financial statements are expressed in
thousands of current United States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, and uncommitted balances are translated from the functional currency to the reporting currency at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a
reporting period. Contributions included in the financial
statements during the period are translated at the applicable exchange rates as of the respective dates of commitment. Revenue and expense amounts in currency
other than the United States dollar are translated for
each semimonthly period at the applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period; such practice
approximates the application of average rates in effect
during the period.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of
the year and the reported amounts of income and expenses
during the year. The actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the

Institute considers that its cash and cash equivalents are
limited to “DUE FROM BANKS.”Financial Statements 231

 

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS

The investment portfolio was composed wholly of
investments denominated in Japanese yen. As of
31 December 1999 and 1998, the estimated fair
value of the investments approximates the amortized
cost. All such investments are due within one year.

The annualized rate of return on the average investments held during the year, based on the portfolio held
at the beginning and end of each month was 0.10%
(0.48% — annualized rate of return for the period ended
31 December 1998).

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority approved by the Board of Directors. The main investment management objective is to maintain security and
liquidity. Subject to these parameters, ADB seeks the
highest possible return on its investments.

In 1999, the Board of Directors approved a new
Investment Authority. The new Investment Authority allows investment in higher-yielding investment
instruments, such as high-quality corporate bonds,
mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities.

NOTE D—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the
amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in
a current transaction between willing parties, other than
in a forced or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are shortterm approximates their carrying amounts.

The Institute’s statement of financial position carrying amounts are considered to approximate fair values
for all significant financial instruments.

NOTE E—STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN AND
POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS

Staff Retirement Plan

The Institute participates in the contributory defined
benefit Staff Retirement Plan (the Plan) of ADB. Every
member of the professional staff, as defined under the
Plan, shall, as a condition of service, become a participant from the first day of service, provided that at such
a date, the staff has not reached the normal retirement
age of 60. Retirement benefits are based on length of
service and highest average remuneration during two
years of eligible service. The Plan assets are segregated
and are not included in the statement of financial position. The costs of administering the Plan are absorbed by
ADB, except for fees paid to the investment managers
and related charges, including custodian fees, which are
borne by the Plan.

Participants are required to contribute 9 1/3% of their
salary to the Plan and may also make voluntary contributions. The Institute’s contribution is determined at a
rate sufficient to cover that part of the costs of the Plan
not covered by the participants’ contributions.

Postretirement Medical Benefits Plan

The Institute participates in the cost-sharing plan of ADB
for retirees medical insurance premiums of ADB. Under
the plan, the Institute is obligated to pay 80% of the
Group Medical Insurance Plan premiums for retirees and
their eligible dependents who elect to participate. The
cost-sharing plan is currently unfunded.

Generally accepted accounting principles require an
actuarially determined assessment of the periodic cost
of postretirement medical benefits.237) ANNUAL REPORT 1999

a Includes special assistance loans and private sector loans but excludes loans withdrawn by the borrower. The US dollar equivalent is in accordance with
the exchange rate prevailing within ADB at the time of loan signing.
b Net refers to cancellation and refund of unused loan amounts.

(ii) for countries with active loans, the contract amount inputted is the percentage of ADB-financed portion and each contract amount was adjusted
upon completion of disbursement.Statistical Annex 251

NOTEONDOLLARAMOUNTS,

ADB's financial statements are expressed in current United
States dollars. The dollar amounts in this Annual Report
refer, unless otherwise stated, to United States dollars
current at the time.

Since | April 1978, when the Second Amendment to
the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) came into effect, the capital stock has been
valued for purposes of ADB's financial statements in terms
of special drawing rights, at the value in current United
States dollars as computed by IMF. For a more detailed
discussion, see OCR-8, Notes to Financial Statements of
Ordinary Capital Resources.309

 

Asian Development Bank Profile

e Asian Development Bank (ADB) was established through a multilateral agreement ratified by 30 countries in 1966. With the addition
of Azerbaijan in 1999, the membership totals

58, of which 42 are in Asia and the Pacific.

ADB's headquarters is in the Philippines. It has
14 overseas offices, and the number is growing. There
are currently resident missions in Bangladesh, Cambodia,
India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,
Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam; a regional mission for the
South Pacific in Vanuatu; and representative offices in
Frankfurt for Europe, Tokyo for Japan, and Washington,
DC for North America. Resident missions in the People’s
Republic of China, Kyrgyz Republic, and Lao People's
Democratic Republic will open in 2000. ADB also has
extended missions in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and
Thailand. ADB has nearly 2,000 employees, coming from
almost 50 countries.

ADB engages in economic and social development
activities aimed at improving the welfare of the people
of the region. Its fundamental purpose is to reduce
poverty through pro-poor and sustainable economic
growth, social development, and good governance. To
this end, ADB fosters economic growth, promotes human
development (including population planning), aims to
improve the status of women, and seeks to protect the
environment. In all its work, ADB strives to support
private sector development, strengthen management
capacity in the public sector, develop human resources,
and help manage natural resources in a sustainable
manner. ADB pays special attention to the needs of
smaller and less-developed countries, and gives priority to activities that contribute to the economic growth
of the region as a whole and that promote regional
cooperation.

ADB's lending supports and promotes investment
for development purposes. ADB offers a range oflending
modalities and terms; all loans involve conditionalities
aimed at improving development performance. About
80 percent of its lending is from its ordinary capital
resources (OCR). These comprise paid-in capital,
reserves, funds raised through borrowings, and
accumulated retained income. OCR loans are usually for
15-25 years and typically have an interest rate similar

to the disbursement currency’s underlying government
10-year bond rate. OCR loans are nonconcessional and
are generally made to members that have attained a
somewhat higher level of economic development.

ADB also provides loans from its special funds
resources, including the Asian Development Fund (ADF),
a special window for loans on concessional terms to
members with low per capita gross national product and
weak debt-repayment capacity. The ADF is financed by
periodic voluntary contributions from donors.

ADB manages other special funds such as the
Technical Assistance Special Fund, the Japan Special
Fund—including the Asian Currency Crisis Support
Facility—and the ADB Institute Special Fund. It also
manages the fund for the Japan Scholarship Program
and channel financing of grants provided by bilateral
donors to support technical assistance and soft
components of loans.

ADB has a triple-Arating and typically raises about
$4 billion—$5 billion a year from bond issues. It actively
mobilizes financial resources through its cofinancing
operations, tapping officialas well as commercial and
export credit sources.

Technical assistance activities—funded through
grants or loans—help maximize ADB’s development
impact. Most technical assistance grants are used for
loan preparation and for supporting advisory activities
in areas such as law and policy reforms, fiscal strengthening, good governance, capacity building, and natural
resource management.

To support the private sector, ADB participates
directly in financing private sector projects to assist
commercial investors and lenders. ADB also assists
governments through policy dialogue, technical
assistance, and program lending to create an enabling
environment for private sector development.

ADB's highest policy-making body is its Board of
Governors, which meets annually and comprises one
representative of each member. It elects the 12 members
ofthe Board of Directors, with each Director appointing
an Alternate. The President is elected by the Board of
Governors for a five-year term and is Chairperson of the
Board of Directors. The President, assisted by three
Vice-Presidents, conducts the business of ADB.310 ANNUALREPORT1999

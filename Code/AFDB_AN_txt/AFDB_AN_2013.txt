Annual Report 2013Message from the President of
the African Development Bank Group and
Chairperson of the Boards of Directors

 

Donald Kaberuka

President of the African Development Bank Group

| am pleased to submit the Bank Group’s Annual Report for
2013. The global economy, though still weak, shows some
signs of a modest recovery. However, the unwinding of
monetary stimulus has potential downside risks on growth
in the emerging economies.

In 2013, growth for most African countries continued to
be robust and is expected to accelerate in 2014. However,
sustainability requires that the benefits are shared more
equitably. Job creation remains an acute priority everywhere.

In 2013, the Bank committed USD 6.7 billion to projects and
programs in member countries, an increase of some 3 percent
in real terms over the previous year in accordance with our
strategy—the bulk of the investments were in infrastructure.
The lower overall lending at the Bank window was more
than compensated for by higher levels of financing from our
concessional window, the African Development Fund (ADF).

| would like to express my appreciation to member states

contributing to the ADF. Despite tough budgets everywhere,
the ADF-13 was successfully replenished in September, 2013.

Annual Report 2013

| welcome Libya, Angola and Turkey as new contributors to
the ADF and look forward to more African countries doing
the same in the future.

The year marked the beginning of the implementation of the
Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy. We have made progress on our
goal of creating a new vehicle for mobilizing resources from
Africa and elsewhere to finance infrastructure projects on the
continent. | am equally pleased to report steady progress on
decentralization. This proximity to the countries is impacting
positively on our operations and country dialogue.

Despite the unfavourable global economic environment,
the Bank has maintained a strong financial position. Our
risk-bearing capacity remains robust. The four major rating
agencies once again reaffirmed their AAA rating of the Bank’s
senior debt, with a stable outlook. This confirms the Bank’s
capital adequacy, prudent financial and risk management,
solid shareholder support, and preferred creditor status.

2014 is a pivotal year for the Institution. After ten years of
relocation to Tunis, the process of returning the Bank to its
headquarters in Abidjan, Céte d'Ivoire, is well underway, in
accordance with the roadmap agreed upon in Marrakech. All
efforts are being made by the teams in Tunis and Abidjan to
ensure an orderly return of the Bank and minimal disruption
to its operations. Business continuity will be given maximum
attention. | wish to thank the authorities of both Céte d'Ivoire
and Tunisia for providing all the support required to ensure
the smooth completion of this exercise.

Finally, | would like to thank our shareholders, and our partners
for their continued support. A special thanks to the Boards of
Directors for skilfully steering the Bank through the year, and
Management and staff for contributing to the results achieved.
We can look forward to another successful year for the Bank
Group, in fulfilling its mandate.

Donal Kaberuka
President, African Development Bank Group,
Chairperson of the Boards of DirectorsExecutive Summary

Performance and Prospects

Economic performance. |n 2013, Africa continued to demonstrate resilience in the face of slow recovery of the global
economy, although with broad variation across countries and
regions. Growth in sub-Saharan Africa was 5 percent, and
excluding South Africa, about 6 percent (Figure 0.1). West
Africa registered the highest rates of growth, about 7 percent (same level as recorded in 2012), followed closely by
East Africa with about 6 percent, about 2 percentage points
above those of 2012. Central Africa grew at about 4 percent
(compared to 6 percent in 2012) with the eruption of armed
conflict in the Central African Republic reducing growth prospects for the sub-region in the near term. North Africa grew by
1.9 percent, a decline of approximately 8 percentage points
compared with 2012. In Southern Africa, growth averaged
3.0 percent, indicating little change from 2012. Low-Income
Countries (LICs), including Fragile States, grew by about
5 percent on average. Among major oil exporters, growth
was highest for Angola, Gabon and Nigeria, at 5 percent or
above. The investment-driven economies, that is countries
transitioning toward manufacturing and services as drivers
of the economy, grew at between 3 to 7 percent.

Macroeconomic management. Africa’s average inflation
fell by 2 percentage points to 6.7 percent in 2013, compared
to 2 percent in the US and the EU, and to a global average
of 6 percent. Overall, countries maintained a cautious fiscal stance. The average fiscal deficit as a percent of GDP
rose to 3.9 percent in 2013 from 2.9 percent in 2012. The
current account deficit increased to 2.5 percent of GDP in
2013 from 1.5 percent in 2012. Net oil-exporting countries

saw their current account surplus as a percentage of GDP
fall from 2.3 percent in 2012 to 0.8 percent in 2013, while
the current account deficit was 8 percent of GDP for oil
importers, compared to 7.6 percent in 2012.

External financing. In spite of the financial crisis, remittances
and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) have continued to flow to
Africa in relatively high volumes in recent years. Remittances
reached some USD 65 billion in 2013, an increase of 5 percent
over 2012. They have reflected a resilience that is beginning
to attract the interest of governments and the private sector
in Africa. Net FDI flows grew by about 9 percent to USD
57 billion in 2013. The latter reflects the search for value by
investors in the West in a climate of generally low interest
rates. The bulk of the FDI went to mineral prospecting and
capacity building in the extractive industries across Africa.
However, in spite of the shortage of capital for investment
on the continent, substantial amounts of resources continue
to flow out of the countries illicitly.

Growth prospects. Africa’s growth is projected to be about
4.8 percent in 2014 and 5.7 percent in 2015. Growth in
Central Africa is expected to be about 6 percent in 2014
and 2015, although the armed conflict in the Central African
Republic as noted to above has lowered prospects. East
Africa is expected to grow at about 6 percent in 2014, but
rates might rise with the new oil and gas discoveries in the
region, and expectations of increased investment in prospecting and transport infrastructure. North Africa is expected to
grow by 3.1 percent in 2014 and 5.5 percent in 2015, contingent on the socio-economic developments in the region.
Southern Africa as a whole is expected to grow at 4 percent
in 2014 and 4.4 percent in 2015, with some countries such
as Zambia posting growth rates of above 7 percent. South
Africa, the regional motor, is projected to grow at 2.7 percent
and 3 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively—that is somewhat higher than in the recent past. Average growth in West
Africa is projected at about 7 percent in 2014 and 2015, on
the back of expanding natural resource sectors and diversification efforts.

Post-MDG Agenda

Although Africa has made some progress towards meeting
the Millennium Development Goals, including reduction in
child and maternal mortality, attainment of universal primary education, and improvement in gender parity, countries
are looking toward a Post-MDG agenda that emphasizes economic inclusion and structural transformation. In
2011, the Bank, the African Union Commission (AUC), the
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), and the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) initiated a series of
consultations on the Post-2015 Development Agenda. The
emerging “Africa’s Common Position” underlines the following

Annual Report 2013four items: (1) structural transformation and green growth;
(2) innovation and technology transfer; (8) human capital
development; and (4) sustainable financing and partnerships.

Global Value Chains and the Bank’s Response

Global value chains are an important and dynamic tool that
Africa could use to industrialize and integrate beneficially into
the global economy. The concept dictates that being part of
the chain of production can be of greater value than controlling
the entire production process. However, countries will need
to examine the costs and benefits of GVCs to avoid being
locked into low productivity value chains, or to be subjected
to environmental degradation. GVCs could also erode regional
trade arrangements. Success will require an innovative and
far-sighted approach that takes full advantage of Africa’s vast
natural resources, youthful population and growing middle
class to industrialize and diversify the economy. At the operational level, a number of Bank projects and activities with
implications for GVCs have been implemented in agriculture,
transport, and ICT. The Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy, 2013-2022,
highlights the importance of GVCs in linking Africa to the global
economy. Bank policies and strategies in the private sector,
regional integration, agriculture and human development also
indicate the same thrust. Recent examples of private sector
operations with high potential for boosting GVCs include
Bank support for Nigerian manufacturing and agribusiness,
the Trade Finance Program, worth USD 1 billion set up in
2013, and lending to transport and energy projects in East
and Southern Africa. Studies and other knowledge work
touching on GVCs have also been undertaken in the Bank.

Bank Group Operations
Overview. |n 2013, total Bank Group operations amounted
to UA 4.39 billion, an increase of about 3 percent compared

Annual Report 2013

to 2012 (Figure 0.2). ADF operations amounted to UA 2.27
billion, an increase of about 20 percent compared to 2012.
ADB operations declined by 12 percent to UA 1.83 billion in
2018, due mainly to economic and political disruptions among
key borrowers from the ADB window. The Bank explored a
number of options to boost business development, including
whether to amend the Bank’s credit policy to allow low-income
Regional Member Countries (RMCs) direct access to the ADB
sovereign window under well stipulated conditions; scaling
up public-private partnerships and co-financing opportunities;
and exploring new financing sources, including equity, pension
funds and the emerging economies.

Aligning to the Ten-Year Strategy. During 2013, the Bank
financed a number of projects that fit in well within the twin
objectives of the Ten-Year Strategy—inclusive growth and
transition to green growth. Examples include support for a
project for inclusive growth and competitiveness in Senegal,
sanitation projects in ten countries financed by the African
Water Facility, and projects promoting skills and human
development, agriculture and rural development. The latter
incorporated segments are targeted at women and the
youth. In the area of green growth, the Bank approved six
projects, including a thermal power project in Djibouti and
a project to scale up energy access in Rwanda. The Bank’s
Climate Investment Funds financed agricultural projects
targeted at reducing emissions caused by deforestation
and forest degradation (REDD+) in Ghana, Burkina Faso
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Bank Group Operations by Priority and

Areas of Special Emphasis

Infrastructure approvals, mostly transport and energy, received
the bulk of the Bank Group resources (Figure 0.3), although

xiother core priorities such as private sector development,
agriculture, and multisector operations (for governance and
accountability) also received support.

Infrastructure. During the year, Bank Group infrastructure
approvals amounted to UA 2.05 billion (67.6 percent) of
which transport was the dominant subsector (32.2 percent).
The Bank undertook projects worth UA 1.18 billion in the
areas of transport, ICT and related infrastructure. The Walvis
Bay Container Terminal Project in Namibia (worth UA 198.4
million) will provide a high-quality link to the sea for many
landlocked countries in the region.

Energy operations. |n 2013, the Bank Group’s energy operations (public and private sector loans and grants) amounted
to UA 569.1 million, with public sector operations accounting
for 57.9 percent of the total. The Bank financed an electricity network interconnection project for Céte d’lvoire, Liberia,
Sierra Leone, and Guinea, valued at UA 128.2 million that
will have important implications for regional integration.
The Grand Inga 3 hydroelectric project in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo is another important project in that
regard. The Bank contributed UA 44.4 million towards the
preparation of the first phase of the project. Eventually the
project will generate 4,800 MW and be able to supply electricity at home and for export to the Republic of South Africa.

Water supply and sanitation. During the year, Bank Group
approvals for water supply and sanitation operations amounted to UA 356.8 million, including special funds. The special funds, namely the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Initiative, the African Water Facility, and the Multi-Donor
Water Partnership Program, supported projects in 18 RMCs.

Regional operations. Total approvals for regional operations
amounted to UA 1.32 billion in 2013, a 37.8 percent increase
over 2012. The largest share went to infrastructure (51.8 percent), closely followed by the financial sector (40.5 percent),
for lines of credit, trade finance and equity financing. The
Bank also supported socio-economic initiatives in the Sahel,
the Horn of Africa, and the Mano River region, in partnership
with other agencies. In November 2013, the President of the
Bank, together with other dignitaries including the United
Nations Secretary-General visited the Sahel region to get
a first-hand assessment of the situation in the region and
how the international community could assist.

Private sector and Africa50. |n 2013, the Bank financed
87 private sector operations, worth UA 1.05 billion, a 39.4
percent increase over 2012. Finance, mainly in the form of
guarantees, lines of credit and equity participation, accounted for 65.5 percent of the operations. Energy accounted for
22.9 percent, comprising mostly renewable energy, such as

xii

the Lake Turkana Wind Power project in Kenya. Agriculture
accounted for 11.3 percent of the total, including projects in
agribusiness and fertilizer production. During the year, the
Bank embarked on the creation of Africa50, as an innovative financing vehicle for infrastructure. It aims at mobilizing
private financing to accelerate the speed of infrastructure
delivery, thereby creating a new platform for Africa’s growth.

Governance. The Bank Group approved 54 projects and
programs in support of good governance across 30 countries for a total of UA 465.7 million during 2013. The focus
was on strengthening policies and institutions for increased
effectiveness, transparency and accountability in the management of public finances, and the improvement of the
investment climate for private sector led growth.

Skills and human development. During 2013, the Bank
Group approved some UA 337.9 million to improve skills
and promote human development. Two projects were
approved for Morocco for a program to ensure that skills
training matches the needs of the employers, and a program for the reform of medical insurance coverage. Also
important were projects for skills development for Rwanda
and Senegal, targeting the youth.

Areas of special emphasis: agriculture and food security,
gender and Fragile States. Total project approvals for agriculture and food security amounted to UA 530.5 million,
including special funds of UA 101.9 million in 2013. This
comprised operations in infrastructure rehabilitation for crop,
fisheries and livestock production; construction of access
and feeder roads; biodiversity conservation; strengthening
climate resilience; and sustainable forest management and
conservation. The draft Gender Strategy was completed
during 2013 and awaits Board approval in early 2014. During
the year, a Special Envoy on Gender was appointed to provide leadership for the Bank’s gender agenda. Moreover, the
preparation of Country Strategy Papers for Liberia, Sierra
Leone, Mauritius, DRC, lvory Coast and Kenya, with gender
experts on mission teams, was a key step in mainstreaming
gender in all Bank operations. On the other hand, the Fragile
States Unit was transformed into a full-fledged Department.
The Report of the High-Level Panel on Fragile States, led by
the President of Liberia, was presented at the African Union
Summit in January 2014. It provides new thinking on the
way forward in resolving socio-economic fragility in Africa.

The Bank’s Key Corporate Reforms and Governance

Institutional reforms. The Ten-Year Strategy was approved in
April 2013 and was followed soon afterwards by the fine-tuning of the Bank's institutional structure to ensure alignment
with the new policy thrust. A new position of Group Chief Risk
Officer was created, as well as an African Natural Resources

Annual Report 2013Centre (ANRC), new departments dedicated to business
and financial development, and a delivery and performance
office. A number of departments were adjusted or merged
and there was considerable staff movement. Notably, the
field office for Nigeria became a country office, headed by a
director. The Bank’s field presence increased further in 2013,
from 34 to 37 countries, although with only 31 Field Offices.
A number of staff are embedded in other agencies or oversee countries from neighbouring Field Offices. In the area of
human resource management, a People Strategy (2013-17)
was launched and a staff survey undertaken. The preliminary
results indicate increased staff satisfaction and motivation.

Policies and strategies. A number of policies, strategies and
guidelines were introduced during 2013, meant to help operationalize the Ten-Year Strategy (TYS). They include: Guidelines
on the Cancellation of Eligible Non-Sovereign Operations;
Private Sector Development Policy; and accompanying Private
Sector Development Strategy; and the Independent Evaluation
Strategy. The Amendment to the Bank Group Credit Policy
will be brought to the Board for consideration during 2014.

Development effectiveness. In December 2013, the Bank
adopted the Integrated Safeguards System (ISS) to promote
growth that is socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable, in line with the TYS. Furthermore, the Bank introduced
an evidence-based and results-focused method for assessing
project performance, making the new Implementation Progress
and Results Report (IPR) and the revised Project Completion
Report (PCR) mandatory aspects of project reporting. The
Bank’s quality-at-entry standards developed in 2010 were
also updated. The new set of criteria for use in the readiness
review became effective from 1 January 2014.

The ADF-13 replenishment. In September 2013, the replenishment of ADF-13 was finalized. Participants reaffirmed their
commitment to supporting Africa’s economic transformation
and agreed to a total replenishment level of UA 5.345 billion for
the period 2014 to 2016. The Performance Based Allocation
formula was preserved, although a means to account for the
infrastructure deficit was introduced.

Intermediate recourse mechanisms. During 2013, the
Office of the Auditor General continued to monitor the impact
of changes in policies and procedures on Bank performance.
Anew Staff Integrity and Ethics Office (SIEO) was created by
the Bank as part of the fine-tuning exercise. Ethics officers
will continue to provide advice and counsel to staff, while
Integrity officers will investigate, and prosecute, through the
Bank’s internal justice system, staff that violate rules or prescribed standards. The exception will be cases of corruption,
which will be handled by the Integrity and Anti-Corruption
Department (IACD). During the year the IACD introduced a

Annual Report 2013

two-tier sanctions regime composed of a sanctions entity
that is independent of the investigative office, in line with the
Agreement for Mutual Enforcement of Debarment Decisions.

Operations evaluation. During the year, the Boards of Directors
approved the Bank Group’s Independent Evaluation Strategy,
2013-2017. It will promote learning, accountability, and an
evaluation culture for the Bank in support of the overarching
goal of improving development effectiveness in countries.
Compared to previous years, the number of thematic, sector,
corporate and country strategy evaluations increased, while
those for stand-alone projects have decreased. Moreover,
attempts were made throughout the year to create synergies
between project level work and thematic and sector-level
evaluations.

Boards’ oversight and strategic responsibilities. The Boards
of Directors discharged their oversight and strategic responsibilities in several areas during 2013. Key strategies and policies
were approved, notably the Ten-Year Strategy for 2013 to 2022
and the ADF-13 replenishment was successfully concluded.
The monitoring of the budget, including its mid-term review,
was a key oversight instrument. In March 2013, the Boards
of Directors approved the Return to Headquarters Roadmap
Matrix. To ensure an orderly return, the Boards worked with
Management to oversee its implementation, including making
trips to Abidjan. On their part, the Boards of Governors met
at the 2013 Annual Meetings held in Marrakech, Morocco, in
May 2013 to deliberate on a number of issues. During their
Governors’ Dialogue, they examined the issue of structural
transformation and natural resource management in Africa,
and how the continent could maximize benefits from its own
resources. They welcomed the Bank’s Africa50O initiative for
private financing of infrastructure, and encouraged the Bank
to complete all the practical details to enable its launch. The
Board of Governors adopted the resolution for the return of
the African Development Bank to its Headquarters in Abidjan.

Sound Financial Management

Strong financial position. In spite of the long-drawn global
recession and unfavourable situation in financial markets
in 2013, the Bank continued to exercise sound financial
management as acknowledged by the four rating agencies:
Standard & Poor’s, Moody's, Fitch Ratings, and the Japan
Credit Rating Agency. They once again reaffirmed their AAA
and AA+ rating of the African Development Bank’s senior
debt, with a stable outlook. Their ratings reflect the Bank’s
strong membership support, its preferred creditor status,
sound capital adequacy and prudent financial management,
and lending policies. As at 31 December 2013, the Bank’s
paid-up capital was UA 4.96 billion, the same as in 2012.
The Bank’s callable capital at year-end at UA 60.25 billion
was also the same as at end 2012.

Annual Report 2013Chapter 1

Africa’s Socio-Economic
PerformanceChapter 1 Africa’s Socio-Economic Performance

BM The continent has demonstrated considerable resilience in the face of the slow recovery of the
global economy, with growth well spread out in all its sub-regions. Natural resources continued
to power growth in 2013, especially among major oil producing regions. But also notable was the
good performance of countries that are not richly endowed with natural resources, depending
increasingly on good policies to attract domestic and foreign investment. Isolated examples
of economic setbacks indicate the need for diligence in addressing deep-seated economic
inequalities and in the provision of social services. Economic prospects look good on the whole,
given the strengthening of the global economic recovery. Africa is expected to grow at 4.8 and
5.7 percent during 2014 and 2015 respectively. Future growth needs to be higher and more
diversified to create a firmer basis for structural transformation. This chapter reviews Africa’s
economic performance during 2013. It looks specifically at growth performance and prospects,
macroeconomic management, and the mobilization of resources, both internal and external. It

concludes with a discussion of MDGs and the post- MDG Agenda.
|

1.1 Growth Performance

Africa’s growth compared favourably with that of other developing regions of the world and the major economies. Domestic
demand has been an important growth factor, but so has
better macroeconomic management. With a few exceptions,
countries have maintained relatively low rates of inflation, while
fiscal deficits have been manageable. The higher inflows of
financial resources to Africa in recent years, both from remittances and foreign direct investment (FDI), have more than
compensated for the generally low levels of domestic savings.
A key driver of growth has been high demand for Africa’s minerals, oil and gas from the emerging markets.

Real GDP growth. Africa grew by about 4 percent in 2013,
a reduction of some two percentage points compared to
2012. Growth in sub-Saharan Africa was 5 percent, and
excluding South Africa, about 6 percent (Figure 1.1). Africa’s
performance compares favourably with that of the rest of
the world in 2013, given declining growth among emerging
economies in Asia (6.6 percent) and Latin America and the
Caribbean (8 percent), and slow recovery in the developed
world—notably the US (1.5 percent), the eurozone (where it
actually fell by 0.4 percent) and Japan (2 percent). Growth
on the continent has also been well distributed among
sub-regions.

The prices of oil, gas and other commodities (Figure 1.2)
have been key factors in Africa’s recent growth, and the con
4

tinent’s mineral and oil exporters continued to register trade
surpluses, although prices are unlikely to return to the highs
of the past decade. However, new natural resource projects
are emerging in more places in Africa than ever before, and
they will continue to reflect on the growth picture for years
to come. It should be borne in mind that Africa, as a whole,
needs to maintain average growth rates of above 7 percent
in the medium to long term to generate the employment and
incomes required to reduce mass poverty.

Africa’s growth typologies 2013. Africa is a continent of wide
variations in terms of economic structure, natural resource
endowment, and level of development. While average growth
rates provide a good overall assessment of Africa’s current and
medium-term prospects, they obscure a number of features
crucial for understanding the nature of its recent progress.
In Table 1.1 Regional Member Countries (RMCs) have been
divided into four broad categories, which though not exclusive, do provide good examples of variations in performance
across the continent: (i) those that can access the Bank’s
Fragile States Facility, typically countries with low average
scores on the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
(CPIA); (ii) factor-driven economies (usually low income and
exporters of raw commodities); (iii) major oil exporters; and
(iv) investment-driven economies (also called emerging economies, typically countries in transition towards manufacturing and services as basis for the economy). We have also
placed each country in one of five growth brackets during
2013, ranging from below 1 percent to more than 7 percent.

Growth in post-conflict and conflict-affected economies was
relatively high in 2013. For instance, growth rates of above
8 percent were recorded for the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Céte d’lvoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and South Sudan.
Natural resources, which were sometimes in the past a cause
of conflict for many of these countries are now providing a
basis for reconciliation and national reconstruction in some
of them. Fourteen of the eighteen countries that can access
the Bank’s Fragile States Facility (not all chose to do so) posted growth rates of 3 percent or above in 2013. The Central
African Republic was the exception with growth declining by
over 10 percent in 2013. It is also significant that many LowIncome Countries (also Known as factor-driven) that depend
more on agriculture, minerals, other than oil, and light manufacturing, performed well in 2013, in spite of weak global
demand. Table 1.1 shows that seventeen such countries, led
by Ethiopia (above 7 percent), and drawn
from most parts of the continent, registered
growth that was above 3 percent on average. Ten countries in this category grew
between 5 and 7 percent.

Among major oil exporters, growth was highest for Angola, Gabon and Nigeria, at above
5 percent. Equatorial Guinea saw growth
fall in 2013 to below 1 percent, compared
to above 5 percent in 2012. A major oil
field has reached its peak, and is in decline,
while new prospects under development are
yet to be completed. In the case of Libya,
socio-economic disruptions during the year
prevented the rolling out of new investment,
and led to growth falling below one percent.

The economies referred to as investment-driven registered
growth rates that were, at about 4 percent on average, comparable to those of their peers—Low- and Middle-Income
Economies— elsewhere in the world. Six countries were in this
category, posting growth rates of 3 percent and above. The
tourist sectors in Kenya, Morocco and Seychelles continued
to perform well, but manufacturing performance was below
expectations. Typically Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows
remained low. Cabo Verde, Egypt, South Africa and Tunisia
grew at below 3 percent.

Regionally, Central Africa grew by 3.7 percent compared to
about 6 percent in 2012. But prospects had worsened significantly by the end of 2013 as armed conflict ensued in the
Central African Republic. East Africa grew by 6.2 percent on
average, about 2 percent higher than 2012. In North AfricaChapter 1 Africa’s Socio-Economic Performance

growth was 1.9 percent in 2013, a decline of more than 8
percentage points compared with 2012, owing to social
unrest in some countries. Southern Africa’s growth averaged
3.0 percent in 2013, indicating little change from 2012. West
Africa grew by 6.7 percent, a decrease of 0.2 percent on the
previous year.

1.2 Macroeconomic Management

African policy makers continued to pursue cautious macroeconomic policies in 2013, characterized by low inflation and,
on the whole, manageable fiscal positions. It is notable that
fiscal discipline was exercised by countries in all sub-regions,
including those well-endowed by natural resources. Resource
mobilization was a key preoccupation, although revenue effort
for many countries remained below that in other developing
regions.

6

Inflation. On the whole, African governments continued to
pursue cautious monetary and fiscal policies in 2013. Coupled
with sluggish global demand, average inflation rates improved
by 2 percentage points to 6.7 percent in 2013; compared
to global rates of 6 percent, and rates of less than 2 percent
in the US and the EU (Figure 1.3). Inflation in WAEMU and
CAEMC member countries was at about 2 percent, close to
the eurozone average, resulting from the pegging of the local
currency, the CFA, to the euro. Elsewhere in Africa, inflation
rates were more varied, but remained generally within single digits as in 2012. Exceptions were countries such as
Sudan and Malawi that experienced economic shocks during 2013, and saw inflation rates rising to approximately 30
percent. In East Africa, inflation fell to about 12 percent from
about 20 percent in 2012. In terms of underlying structures,
net oil-exporting countries experienced higher inflation than
net oil-importing countries—with a margin of 2 percentage

points between them. African inflation is expected to remain
moderate in the medium term.

Fiscal and current account balances. Africa experienced
some deterioration in its current account and fiscal balances for
2018, with notable differences between net oil-exporters and net
oil-importers (Figures 1.4 and 1.5). Net oil-exporting countries
saw their current account surplus as a percentage of GDP
fall from 2.3 percent in 2012 to 0.8 percent in 2018, while the
current account deficit was 8 percent of GDP for oil-importers,
compared to 7.6 percent in 2012. Africa’s overall fiscal deficit
as a percent of GDP increased from 2.9 percent in 2012 to 3.9
percent in 2013. But there was considerable variation: countries

experiencing social disruptions of various kinds, witnessed more
fiscal and current account pressures than others.

1.3 External Financing

One of the remarkable stories of the past decade is the global
shift in sentiment regarding investing in Africa. The rapid
rise in foreign direct investment (FDI) since the early 2000s
and increases in remittances have compensated for Africa’s
relatively low rates of savings. FDI inflows fell well short of
what the continent requires for its structural transformation.
Innovative approaches to funding Africa’s development are
urgently needed. One such effort is to curb the illicit flow of
finances out of the continent.

Three interrelated factors explain the large and sustained
inflows of external financing to Africa in recent years—in spite
of the deep recession that affected developed countries and
the decline of development assistance. The first is the natural
resource boom, including oil and gas, from which a number
of African countries have benefitted in the past decade, and
which have attracted financing from China and other emerging
economies. Second has been the search for value by investors from developed countries in Africa’s frontier markets as
returns in mature markets declined. Third, remittances from
the African Diaspora have been rising steadily in the past
decade in response to increasing investment opportunities,
including the real estate sector—and have become the most
important source of financial flows to Africa, surpassing both
FDI and Official Development Assistance (ODA) (Figure 1.6).

However, Africa’s financing gap remains large and countries in
most parts of the continent are looking for ways to enhance

domestic resource mobilization. The natural resource boom
and the political economy of election cycles have sometimes
eroded domestic revenue raising efforts. However, the long
global recession, which weakened donor budgets, has forced
many African countries to find other avenues for financing
their public sector activities, including reduction in subsidies,
strengthening tax efforts and setting realistic tariffs for utilities,
including electricity.

Remittances. In spite of the global financial crisis, remittances
witnessed only a mild decline, and then continued to rise
(Figure 1.6). They grew to USD 65 billion in 2013, up by 5
percent over 2012. They are expected to reach USD 67 billion
in 2014. The bulk of remittances went to North and West Africa,
the regions with the largest number of diaspora communities
abroad. The two regions received about 80 percent of total
remittances. As a source, Europe accounted for 40 percent
of the remittance inflows, the United States for 28 percent,
Africa itself for 13 percent, and the Middle East for 9 percent.

Official Development Assistance (ODA). ODA amounted to
about USD 55 billion in 2013, about the same as 2012, indicating
a small decline in real terms. It continues to be an important
source of financing for many countries in Africa, particularly
conflict-affected and post-conflict countries. Among the latter,
ODA financed upwards of 40 percent of total budgets and a
considerable part of their public sector capital spending in 2013.

Foreign direct investment. Net FDI flows to the continent
as a whole were some USD 57 billion in 2013, an increase of
about 14 percent over the previous year. The increase reflects
the search for value by investors in the West, in a climate of
generally low interest rates and slow recovery. The bulk of

8

these investments went to mineral prospecting and building
new capacities in the extractive industries across Africa.

For comparative purposes, the size of foreign direct investment as a percentage of GDP in 2013 has been presented
in three categories in Table 1.2: (i) the high FDI category, with
10 countries with ratios exceeding 10 percent; (ii) the medium
FDI category, with 23 countries with ratios between 3 and 10
percent; and (iii) the low FDI category, with 19 countries with
ratios below 3 percent. It can be noted, in contrast, that net
FDI to OECD countries amounted to only about 2.4 percent
of GDP in 2013, indicating that size effects matter.

The high FDI category comprised many mineral-rich countries,
notably the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or those currently
developing new oil or gas deposits, such as Mozambique.
However, only Gabon and Equatorial Guinea belong to the
group of mature oil exporters — although Congo also exports
oil in large quantities. In most of these countries, investments
from emerging economies dominated FDI inflows. The medium
FDI category includes a larger and more varied group of
countries with at least four investment-driven economies,
but with a number of factor-driven ones as well, though not
necessarily dominated by natural resource economies. The
low FDI category contains a number of large countries such as
South Africa, which get substantial amounts of FDI in nominal
terms, but which are low relative to the size of their GDP.

Among the countries receiving relatively high levels of FDI,
Mozambique’s offshore gas finds in the Indian Ocean, and
rich mineral resources in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo and Mauritania have been important targets. Among
medium level recipients of FDI, agriculture and manufacturing
have attracted considerable attention.

While there are many factors that affected the flow of FDI to
Africa as a whole and to regions and countries in particular in
2013, anumber of important features are summarized below:

e FDI net inflows to South Africa fell by some 20 percent in
2013, adding to a decline of a similar magnitude in 2012.

e There was a sizeable flow of South African FDI to other
parts of Africa, mostly in finance and utilities.

e In West Africa, inadequate port capacities raised production costs and were a disincentive to FDI in some countries.
Many countries, including Nigeria, embarked on projects to
rectify port congestion and to improve turnaround times.

e Although the buoyancy of investments in the oil and gas

sectors in Africa is unmistakable, the regulatory environment
is still inadequate in many countries. The Bank’s African

Legal Support Facility (ALSF) has been helping a number
of countries to formulate regulatory frameworks for their oil,
gas and mining sectors.

¢ Countries, notably in East Africa, are recognizing the
importance of collaboration, over regulatory frameworks,
and sharing costs in the development of ports, and related
infrastructure, to deepen markets and enable regional
participation in global value chains.

New sources of external financing. A large number of African
countries have tapped into the international bond markets in
recent years. In 2013 alone, Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania and
Rwanda raised some USD 4 billion, while Kenya, Angola

and Uganda were planning to go to the markets in 2014.

However, there has been concern that the reversal of the
policy of quantitative easing, primarily in the US, might disrupt
the growth of emerging economies and scuttle international
bond markets. Already, the end of 2013 saw the return of
volatility of capital flows to emerging economies, lowering
growth prospects in China, and by implication in Africa.

Illicit financial flows. While Africa is eager to attract financial
resources for development, many governments are concerned

that large sums of money have been taken out of the continent illicitly. The methods used range from underpricing of
export commodities to various forms of financial fraud. It has
been estimated that reducing illicit flows, even by a limited
amount, could greatly contribute to the resources available for
investment on the continent, and hence for poverty reduction.
However, the approaches and systems required to stem the
flow demand a high level of commitment by governments,
the private sector and other stakeholders, including the international community.

1.4 Economic Prospects

Africa’s medium-term prospects are good. Above-average
growth is expected, in light of slow, but improving global economic recovery. Natural resources will continue to be important determinants of performance. But equally important will
be Africa’s ability to attract FDI and to embark on sustainable
industrialization and trade in manufactured goods.

Real GDP growth. Africa’s average GDP growth is expected
to be 4.8 and 5.7 percent during 2014 and 2015, respectively, buttressed by an improving global economy. Map 1.1
presents Africa's regional growth projections for 2014. As in

9Chapter 1 Africa’s Socio-Economic Performance

previous years, growth will be sustained by strong domestic
demand, associated in many countries with investments in
infrastructure and expansion of export capacities.

Growth in Central Africa was expected to be about 6 percent in 2014 before the armed conflict in the Central African
Republic, but is likely to be lower in the medium term. The
Democratic Republic of the Congo has the potential to grow
at 8 percent or more during 2014 and 2015. The Republic
of Congo, on the other hand, is well positioned to bolster
growth by attracting investment into its natural resource-rich
economy. Chad is projected to grow at close to 9 percent in
the medium term, driven by investments in oil and agriculture.
In East Africa, economies are expected to grow at about 6
percent on average. But the dynamics are changing with the
new oil and gas discoveries in the region, which are expected
to attract FDI in prospecting and construction of infrastructure. Armed conflict in South Sudan has disrupted business
in the region, but is not expected to have a lasting impact on
performance. North Africa is expected to grow by 3.1 percent in 2014 and by 5.5 percent in 2015. However, political
developments in the region will be a key determining factor.

In Southern Africa, South Africa is projected to grow at 2.7
percent and 3 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The
impact of South Africa’s growth on the region will be marked
during the next cycle of global recovery. Other countries in the
region, notably Zambia, are expected to post higher growth
rates, above 7 percent. In particular, Zimbabwe is expected
to return to more normal capacities, growing at around 4 percent, following serious reform attempts in the past few years.
Growth in Mozambique is expected to rise substantially in the
medium term, to above 8 percent. Botswana, Lesotho and
Swaziland are expected to post growth rates of between 2
and 6 percent.

West Africa will continue to demonstrate Africa's best prospects
for growth in the medium term. Average growth is projected
at about 7 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively. This will
mainly be due to the rich natural resource endowment and
the reaping of the peace dividend, including higher tourism
flows. Structural reforms and the consolidation of peace will
help ensure regional stability and high growth.

Macroeconomic outcomes. Inflation is expected to be moderate in the medium term, at about 7 percent in both 2014
and 2015, reflecting continuing disinflation in Low-Income
Countries and projected good weather patterns. Fiscal deficits are expected to increase in 2014 and 2015, respectively,
as countries adjust to demanding fiscal environments, with
expenditures exceeding revenue. The deterioration is expected to be sharper for oil and mineral exporters, which could
face weaker commodity prices in the medium term. Shale

oil discoveries in the US are, for example, a major cause of
concern. They are expected to impose a cap on oil prices
globally, which might lower them in real terms over the next
few years. Countries that export oil will nevertheless record
trade surpluses equivalent to 6.2 percent of GDP in 2014,
while oil-importing countries will record deficits equivalent to
11.1 percent of GDP in the same year.

Looking ahead, there are three areas of medium-term policy
concern:

Risks of slowdown of the global economy. Although the
global recovery is well underway, it is subdued and subject
to significant downside risks. The return of economic volatility
among emerging economies, especially in China and other
emerging markets (Brazil, India, Argentina and Turkey), could
well weaken exports and FDI flows. Besides, any further
weakening of the OECD economies is likely to reduce donor
flows to Africa, already adversely affected by the global
economic crises.

Reversal of capital flows. |n the wake of the monetary

tapering by the US Federal Reserve, there is concern that FDI
flows to Africa might slow down considerably. The return of

Annual Report 2013economic volatility among emerging economies could well
weaken exports and FDI flows. Already, emerging markets
are witnessing a toughening of market conditions and the
coupon values for their bond issuances are no longer as
attractive as before.

Home-grown risks. Contagion and neighbourhood effects
have been fairly contained in Africa in recent years, as a result of
more peaceful conditions and improving governance. However,
political upheaval in several Regional Member Countries, if
not resolved, could threaten the gains made during a decade
of robust growth.

1.5 Progress Toward a Post-MDG Agenda

Africa’s Post-MDG Agenda builds on lessons learnt during
implementation of the MDGs. Issues of economic inclusion
and structural transformation will be at the centre of the debate.

Achievement to date. Africa has made progress towards
meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The
proportion of people living in extreme poverty (on less than
USD 1.25 a day) has fallen from 56.5 percent in 1990 to
below 48 percent today. Though poverty has not been
halved, the reduction is still significant. Most countries have
achieved universal primary enrolment, with rates of 90 percent
or higher, even though the quality of delivery is often below
what is required for the steady development of human capital.
In the area of HIV/AIDS, the rate of spread has been halted
and even reversed in some countries. In the area of political
representation by gender, the proportion of seats held by
women in African national parliaments stands at about 20
percent on average, which is much higher than in more
developed countries in the West.

Unfinished agenda. Although the MDGs have been an
important anti-poverty push in Africa as a whole, success
has been far from universal. In sub-Saharan Africa, countries
in conflict or post-conflict situations have seen a steady
worsening of their access to modern services and increasing
levels of poverty. In the worst cases, the situation of women
has deteriorated markedly, leading to high levels of maternal
and child mortality—resulting from malnutrition, and disease.
As the target date of 2015 for achieving the MDGs draws near,
there has been much reflection on measures that should be
adopted in the medium- to long-term to complete the unfinished
agenda. It can be argued, in hindsight, that a number of issues
indispensable to enhancing human development should have
been included in the MDGs:

¢ Protection of human rights —vulnerable groups and minorities

tend to be subjected to gross human rights abuses in
many countries, especially in states of war, with little or no

Annual Report 2013

Africa’s Socio-Economic Performance Chapter 1

redress. Domestic mechanisms offer limited protection in
such cases, while the international community can be slow
in responding to emergencies.

¢ Peace, security and disarmament—in the absence of mechanisms for ensuring permanent peace, many conflict-affected
African countries tend to swing between war and peace.
Defunct armies require alternative livelihoods, which when
not forthcoming force them back into armed rebellion. “Truth
and reconciliation frameworks” though much talked about,
have not worked effectively outside South Africa.

e Environmental sustainability and climate change—
environmental issues and climate change are given top
priority by countries and development agencies in the course
of policy dialogue, but resources and budgetary allocations
to address them are quite limited.

¢ Inequality, job creation and access to services—MDGs
were largely silent on the issues of inequality, including
spatial and gender inequalities, especially manifested
in disparities in access to social services, and incomegenerating opportunities. They also did not consider the
issue of economic transformation explicitly.

1.6 Africa’s Common Position on the Post2015 Development Agenda

African countries have agreed on a common position on the
Post-2015 Development Agenda that emphasizes structural
transformation and inclusive green growth, the use of innovative
technologies, human capital development, and productive
financing partnerships.

In 2011, the African Development Bank, the African Union
Commission, the United Nations Economic Commission for
Africa and the UN Development Program jointly initiated a
series of consultations at sub-regional and continental levels,
with the goal of articulating a common African position on
the Post-2015 Development Agenda. To date, four meetings
have taken place—in Ghana, Kenya, Senegal and Tunisia. The
meeting in Tunisia produced the first draft African Common
Position on the Post-2015 Development Agenda.

So far, the consultation process has identified four broad
development outcomes and a set of enablers as Africa’s priorities for the post-2015 Development Agenda:

¢ Structural economic transformation and inclusive green
growth. Growth should be people-centred, diversified,
promoting green activities and targeted at reducing inequality
by integrating the poor into productive sectors. Africa will
benefit greatly from an environment that is conducive to
industrialization, through the development of value chains
across sectors, and private sector development, including
promoting the transformation of the informal sector. EquityChapter 1 Africa’s Socio-Economic Performance

should be measured using disaggregated outcome indicators,
with a view of integrating them into the goals.

¢ Innovation and technology transfer. Access to energy and
ICT is critical for Africa’s economic and social transformation,
as is basic infrastructure. Africa must seize the technological
and digital innovations in the areas of mobile technology,
cloud computing, biotechnology, e-governance etc., to
expand business opportunities.

¢ Human capital development. There should be emphasis
on equality, improving food security, social protection and
health for all, adequate shelter and access to water, sanitation
and hygiene, gender parity, and eradication of poverty. It
is vital to implement comprehensive policies that include
capacity building and promote market-relevant curricula to
help young people obtain decent and well-paid jobs. To this
end, the quality of education and service delivery should
be measured with emphasis on building core skills that are
relevant to the labour market.

e Financing and partnerships. A Post-2015 Development
Agenda requires adequate financing and an enabling global
environment. Aid flows have been declining in relative
terms and new modalities to support development are
needed. Rather than continued dependence on aid and
global partnerships, Africa must focus more on attracting

 

12

domestic and foreign investment and mobilization of domestic
revenue. Focus must be placed on strengthening financial
intermediation, broadening the tax net and improving
revenue generation capacity through innovative financing
mechanisms, curtailment of illicit financial flows, and efficient
use of existing resources.

1.7 Conclusion: From Resilience
to Transformation

This chapter has painted the picture of a resilient Africa, in the
context of a prolonged global recession. Many countries on the
continent continued to register above average growth rates,
and for some there are signs of the beginning of a process
of structural transformation. High demand for Africa’s natural
resources from the emerging economies has been a key
growth engine in the past decade. However, to push growth
to another level and to ensure a sustainable development
process will require that Africa does more to extract value
from its products, including involvement in their value chains.
The following two chapters discuss the issue of global value
chains (GVCs), which has received much attention in recent
years, and how Africa could benefit. They also look at the
role that the Bank could play in promoting GVCs, including
advising countries on the appropriate entry strategies and
how to avoid some of the negative consequences.

Annual Report 2013Chapter 2
Global Value Chains and Africa’s Integration
into the Global EconomyChapter 2 Global Value Chains and Africa’s Integration into the Global Economy

In the pursuit of Africa’s industrialization and further integration into the global economy, the
logic of global value chains (GVCs) dictates that being part of the chain of production and
maximizing on the component over which countries and their firms enjoy comparative advantage
can be of greater value than controlling the entire production process. However, joining existing
GVCs will not in itself guarantee immediate benefits nor will global value chains be a panacea
for existing weaknesses in economic management and strategic planning. Countries will need
to examine the costs and benefits carefully to avoid being locked into low productivity value
chains and therefore into low-level development trajectories. Success will require an innovative
and far-sighted approach on the part of policymakers, development partners and the private
sector to take full advantage of Africa’s vast natural resources, its youthful population and its
growing middle class to industrialize and diversify its economies. Above all, countries will need
to learn how to best position themselves, including through collaboration with their neighbours,
to draw maximum advantage from links to the rapidly changing global economy. This chapter
discusses global value chains as an additional avenue for Africa’s development and the benefits
of linking to the global economy. It also looks at the structural and policy challenges that must
be addressed, including risks to self-determination, regional integration and the environment.
The chapter also underscores the importance of adequate preparation, and of the support of
governments for success.

2.1 Global Value Chains: What They Are
and How Africa Can Benefit

As a concept “global value chains” derives from the observation
that all production entails a number of steps and actors, with
each instance delivering on the basis of its own resource
endowment, and existing logistical capacity, or geography, and
the speed at which it can get to market, at the country level.
Therefore, elements of the final product can be produced in
many parts of the world and assembled into the final product
in other parts, according to demand conditions, cost of
production and ease of market access. For Africa, and indeed
for the Bank Group, the key question is how to exploit current
and emerging global value chains, while avoiding pitfalls.

Africa has posted annual growth rates of about 6 percent
during much of the past decade. Of the 10 fastest growing
economies in the world during this period, 6 were from
Africa. As noted in Chapter 1, the natural resource boom and
associated activities have been key factors, with demand
from the emerging economies spurring South-South trade
and investment, and creating potential for links to global value

chains. With a large and expanding group of middle income
consumers and increasingly interlocking regional economies,
Africa could well become a global growth pole in its own right
within a generation. But alongside Africa’s promising prospects
are concerns over rising inequality and limited economic
inclusion for the poorer majority. The pursuit of GVCs can be
an important additional instrument in Africa’s broader search
for structural transformation and sustainable development.

The emergence of GVCs in the world today is a direct response
to technological innovations and competitive pressures arising
from globalization. Many firms in the world have increased
their cross-border collaboration, in many cases even directly
integrating their production into that of other companies, to
enjoy economies of agglomeration. GVCs are thus networks of
borderless business systems that comprise a range of activities
performed by firms in different geographical locations —regionally
or globally. Each firm is assigned a specific role in the process,
to bring products or services to market from conception to
final use. Upstream activities, like mining, are typically only a
small component of the chain, with considerably more value
to be garnered ahead during further processing. The goal for

Upstream Activities

  
   
 

 
   
  

 

countries is to participate more actively in these downstream
activities that create more opportunities for value addition. Figure
2.1 presents components of a typical value chain.

Global value chains have been exploited to considerable
advantage by multinational companies (MNCs) and global
conglomerates for a number of business and strategic goals.
Companies like the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing have been
able to outsource the bulk of their production to specialized
companies across the world, including developing countries.
The individual companies are in turn able to outsource to even
smaller companies in their host countries. Ultimately, modern
planes are produced not by one, but by many companies,
each coming on board within a specific global value chain,
including, for instance, power systems, computer systems,
and steering and navigation systems. The ultimate producer
of the product is an assembler of the final product from the
pieces produced by other firms around the world—but its own
involvement has important implications for product design,
quality and branding, which in turn raises the prestige of the
brand, and strengthens the whole of the value chain.

For a country to link profitably to a regional or global value

chain, improved logistics and good information networks
are required. Countries and regions that have invested in

new transport, information and communication technologies
are best placed to benefit from trade in goods and services,
owing to lower costs of transport, and access to information.
This has facilitated the spatial division of labour among global
value chain participants, with certain production processes
located in particular geographical locations according to their
competitive advantage.

2.2 Development Impact of GVCs

Global value chains have become a key feature of international
trade. Major manufacturers source intermediate inputs from a
variety of companies spread all over the world. Experiences
have shown that linking up to GVCs has notable development
impact, including in technological and skills development. But
there are potential risks too, including being locked into lowproductivity chains and exposure to environmental and social
distress in the absence of adequate regulatory measures
and preparation.

Although the practice of global value chains has been highlighted
in recent years, the concept itself is not new, linked in previous
decades to the activities of multinational corporations, which
control global trade. The source of contention then was
that much of the value in the chain was realized in the richer

15Chapter 2 Global Value Chains and Africa’s Integration into the Global Economy

countries where the MNCs had their headquarters. The major
difference today is that considerable emphasis is placed
on value chain governance, which is having some impact,
notably in the garment industry. Apart from the potential for
increasing trade and development, experience from other
developing areas indicates that participation in GVCs has
helped countries to vastly expand capacities at all levels,
including technology adaptation, skills enhancement, and
marketing. This in turn creates a firmer basis for longer-term
industrial upgrading. Indeed participation in GVCs is strongly
correlated with growth performance, within regions where they
have taken hold, notably in Asia, with growth gaps between
participants and non-participants of up to 2 percent of GDP.

Despite offering exciting opportunities, participation in GVCs
involves some risks, including being trapped in low level
value chains that could delay graduation to more productive
levels, disruption of regional integration initiatives and negative
environmental and social impacts. African governments, like their
counterparts in other developing regions, notably Asia, must
undertake cost-benefit analyses and other measures to assess
the benefits that could derive from their pursuit of GVCs as a
development vehicle, with the factors listed below as a guide.

¢ The GVCs’ contribution to job creation and growth will be
quite limited if the country is unable to capture a substantial
share of the value-added created in the chain. Undue focus
on upstream activities could lock the country into low productivity chains with limited potential for economic transformation.

e In the absence of active public interest, assessment and
follow-up, mere participation in the GVCs will not lead to
technology dissemination, nor will it lead to the generation
of enhanced technological skills. Therefore, GVCs should
be seen as part of a broader policy effort for economic and
industrial development.

¢ Environmental and social impacts of GVC activities —
including working conditions and job security, and health and
occupational safety—should be concerns for the whole chain.
But this is often not the case, with participants downstream
able to extricate themselves from such responsibilities.

© GVCs have the potential to distort regional arrangements
and associated value chains, choosing to locate where
incentives, such as tax holidays, are most attractive. This
poses the risk of regional races to the bottom, reducing the
impact of job creation and distorting regional cooperation.

To avoid pitfalls, participation in global value chains requires
thoughtful preparation and planning by both firms and countries:
from research and development to industrial policies and support
for physical infrastructure. As isolated projects sponsored by
individual firms or government departments, GVC projects have
performed far below expectation in many African countries.
The involvement of African firms in GVCs as defined above is
relatively low, and even then, mostly on the lower rungs of the
ladder in the extractive industries and agriculture. Therefore,
the bulk of the value-added in the chains still accrues to firms
in richer countries—examples include cocoa, coffee and
tea within the agricultural sector, and copper and iron ore in

 

 

16

Annual Report 2013mining. Part of the problem has tended
to be the lopsided tariff structures and
the use of trade-distorting subsidies in
global trade that would, for example,
allow tariff-free entry for raw cocoa
beans and impose prohibitive tariffs for
semi-processed cocoa paste or copper
bars and wire. Serious impediments
to full participation in the past include
weak implementation, and in instances,
the absence of industrial policies and
strategies for taking advantage of the
available opportunities.

Today, a confluence of factors, including
cost considerations, strategic location,
and Africa’s emergence as a serious
consumer of goods and services make it a
place where GVCs could thrive. Africa has
an indisputable comparative advantage
in natural resources; they could provide a
viable entry point into GVCs. Additionally,
given its current level of development,
Africa must attract labour-intensive industries, possibly from
Asia, where rising production costs are forcing firms to search
for cheaper locations for parts of their production.

In pursuing GVCs, lessons from Asia point to the need for
specialized skills involving technical training, and the pursuit
of science and technology. Such skills are prerequisite for
involvement in high-level global value chains associated with
industries such as information technology, electronics and
pharmaceuticals. Most importantly, however, countries must
learn to trade competitively. Examples from across the world
indicate that regional trade is the basis for strong global value
chain development. Africa, which has the lowest level of intraregional trade, will start from a low base. But it is precisely for
this reason that it could benefit greatly from a rolling-out of
global value chains, especially for products targeted at the
continent itself.

Specifically, Africa must raise its share in the global trade in
services, including tourism. The continent accounts for only
about 3 to 5 percent of global tourism, or about 60 million
visitors per year. Although many global hotel chains are setting
up in Africa, much more could be done to attract domestic
and regional tourism and to improve linkages to the rest of the
economy, especially the food sector. The experience of India
and the Philippines shows that many African countries could
enhance their capabilities and scale up their involvement in
service value chains, which range from basic to sophisticated
outsourcing services within IT, banking, administrative support,
legal services, and health insurance services. For example

between 2008 and 2009, India exported USD 26.6 billion
in computer-based support services. Indeed the country is
now one of the global leaders in the provision of business
process outsourcing services, a market that was valued at
USD 304 billion in 2013. Many African countries have shown
interest in providing these types of services and are creating
the required infrastructure.

Therefore, apart from exploiting their comparative advantages
in the natural resources sector, notably agriculture and mining,
African countries should strive for niche areas that will place
them higher up in the GVC and enable them to reap gains from
trade. As noted above, this will only be successful if GVCs are
seen as part of a broader strategy for enabling countries to
benefit fully from the new opportunities in the global economy.
GVCs have to be accompanied by skills and infrastructure
development and good economic management.

2.3 Financing and Governance

Access to finance for companies is a key constraint to
the expansion of GVCs in many African countries. Many
indigenous firms have historically been relegated to the
informal sector. However, financial sector reforms have
been useful in providing new financing modalities, although
a substantial financing gap remains. On the other hand, the
governance of GVCs remains a key challenge, especially owing
to lack of regulatory frameworks on labour standards and
the environment, and the ability of MNCs to bring pressure
to bear and to cut deals at the local level. The adoption

17Chapter 2 Global Value Chains and Africa’s Integration into the Global Economy

of a number of international best practices could help in
addressing these and related issues.

Global Value Chain Financing

Cost competitiveness, including in financing, is a crucial
factor for successful participation in global value chains. Many
large corporations, retailers and traders at the top of global
value chains have succeeded in building strong networks
for financing their operations over the years. However, in the
high-risk environment in which many African countries operate,
there are very few financing outlets for firms. Resources in
government-sponsored agencies, notably development banks,
are rationed to a great extent, while the situation at commercial
banks and similar institutions is equally stringent. Many local
firms, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),
are relegated to the informal sector, where borrowing costs
are much higher.

Governments in many African countries have embarked on a
number of reforms within their financial sectors with the goal
of cutting the cost of doing business. A recent innovation has
been the creation of central registries for borrowers in the
belief that this would ultimately lower the risk of lending and
hence the cost of borrowing. The impact, however, has so far
been limited, and rates continue to be very high. Within the
natural resources sector, governments and the private sector
are developing a number of modalities. In many cases and
as part of the Public Private Partnership (PPP) contract, the
governments encourage the main contractors, often foreign
firms, to take on smaller local firms as suppliers or subcontractors. They believe that this type of indirect financing will
not only encourage learning-by-doing, but will also enable the
local firms to raise their local profile and enhance their access
to financing at reasonable cost. In other sectors, such as cut
flowers, which are exported directly, governments in many
African countries provided soft loans to farmers in the earlier
stages, to help them learn the trade. This has not prevented
the bulk of the flower-exporting firms from collapse—as lack
of finance was clearly not the only constraint. Those that have
remained viable, following consolidation, have been able to
sustain the sector's expansion and have become quite profitable.

 

Still, a general absence of long-term credit and venture capital
financing in many African countries implies that access to
value chain financing will vary from country to country and
from situation to situation, depending on local circumstances.
Current examples include small loans for inputs from government
or donor agencies for the crafts industry, to complex loan
products and related marketing services from collaborating
foreign companies in mining.

Whatever their size, value chain financing structures are
crucial to the survival of the chain and its local impact. It can

18

help reduce costs, improve risk management and build trust
along the whole chain. Since GVCs cannot develop in isolation
from the rest of the economy, chain financing is also critical
for the development of the financial sector more generally, as
it adds depth and sophistication to financial products and
advisory services.

Global Value Chain Governance

Global value chains have expanded in the last decade, with
unprecedented levels of geographical dispersal and transnational
coordination in the organization of corporate activities. Equally,
so have concerns over value chain governance. Value chains
previously organized and regulated in domestic settings have
become integrated into global management systems through
complex inter- and intra-firm network arrangements. The
governance of these chains, notably in the area of natural
resource exploitation, including production location decisions,
contractual and technical arrangements, and value distribution,
now extend beyond the control of governments, and sub-national
institutions. Real control tends to increasingly gravitate towards
transnational management spheres, with opaque accountability
to governments in the host country of the chain in question.

Therefore, there is an underlying fear that unbridled profit making
and shareholder value considerations could circumscribe
existing social and environmental regulations, which are
often weak and poorly enforced at the national level—leading
to exploitation and environmental degradation especially in
parts of the global industries based in Low-Income Countries
(LICs). Stakeholder groups have accused MNCs of neglecting
international labour conventions at the local level. They have
also been blamed for the displacement of rural families from
land with little or no compensation, and in the horticultural
industry, of exhausting and polluting water resources with
pesticides and other dangerous chemicals.

African governments can respond to these challenges by
making efforts to reach formal agreements over global value
chains, for example with key transnational companies to set
a precedent, subject to open scrutiny by domestic and other
stakeholders.

At the international level, a number of institutions and instruments
could help countries establish domestic compliance agencies
with respect to supporting responsible business conduct
in GVCs. They include the ILO Tripartite Declaration, the
United Nations Global Compact, and the OECD Guidelines
for Multinational Enterprises. The International Conference on
the Great Lakes Region-OECD-UN Forum on Due Diligence
offers a good example of how to coordinate the actions of
business, civil society, home and host-state governments,
as well as donor agencies, to ensure adherence to good
business practices in mineral supply chains.

Annual Report 20132.4 Pathway to Job Creation
and Industrialization?

Examples from across Africa indicate that GVCs can indeed
create jobs, and provide profitable local niches. However,
whether they can, on their own, tip African countries towards
industrialization and economic diversification, is not clear. This
is because industrialization emerges from the confluence
of policies and other actions by stakeholders—including
appropriate infrastructure development as well as availability
of skilled labour. Actions by a few successful firms might not
be enough to generate momentum, hence the need for a
Joint, big push from the government and the private sector.

The attraction of global value chains to Africa’s policymakers
lies partly in their variety and in the range of economic issues
that they could help resolve. Firms participating in these chains
could range from micro-enterprises employing a limited number
of employees to multinational corporations with thousands
of employees. The environments in which they undertake
their activities, even within a single country, are equally wide
ranging. A global value chain, such as in the beer industry,
might involve a direct link between rural producers and urban
processing at the domestic level in a developing country and
via global transport links and marketing, to supermarkets
and consumers in developed countries. There is inevitably
a feedback loop in terms of investment and inputs from the
developed country to the industry of the developing one.
Important dynamics lie within such chains and they could be
harnessed for development.

Africa’s main interest in GVCs ultimately lies in their potential
for industrialization and job creation, especially for its youthful
population. The natural point of reference is Asia, which
undertook policies specifically targeted at industrialization—
among them, special economic zones (SEZs) that helped
plug those economies into global value chains. The SEZs,
popularized by China, were areas within countries set up
under special regulations and economic incentives designated
for promoting industrialization. SEZs were often established
along the coast to maximize export opportunities, but there
are also a number of cases of inland SEZs, including in a
number of African countries. Most often, the goal is to organize
production around processing and manufacturing activities,
especially for the export market. Another important goal is
job creation. With China and other Asian countries moving
to higher-value industrial and service production, Africa could
potentially benefit from the inevitable shift of some of the
manufacturing capacity from China to countries with lower
costs of production and access to markets. Parts of Africa
seem to satisfy both criteria. Examples include Chinese
investment in Egypt's electronics industry for the production
of TVs, and a Hong Kong-based company investing in the

Annual Report 2013

Global Value Chains and Africa’s Integration into the Global Economy Chapter 2

production of plastics, steel, ceramic tiles, and leather in
Nigeria. Similar examples are found across Africa.

Economic Diversification and Job Creation

Africa’s recent growth, powered by natural resources, has not
led to significant job creation. The generation of an adequate
number of jobs will require structural transformation. This
would involve targeted actions at national and regional levels
to establish production and trade links, and synergies between
different actors along the entire economy through the provision
of incentives for bolstering private sector investments and
competitiveness.

With regard to leveraging GVCs to create jobs, add value
and upgrade skills, Africa has had some notable examples.
They demonstrate the importance of comparative advantage
as determined by logistics, geography, and market proximity,
but also the importance of active government support and
advocacy. Two examples provided here include the production
of flowers in Kenya (Box 2.1) and the auto-parts industry in
Morocco (Box 2.2). Box 2.3 describes GVC opportunities in
the mining, oil and gas sectors in Africa.

Box 2.1
Kenya Flower Industry

Kenya's flower industry is one of the largest in the world and is a key
foreign exchange earner. The country is now a lead exporter of cut rose
flowers to the European Union with a market share of about 38 percent.
Approximately 65 percent of its exported flowers are sold through Dutch
auctions to the United Kingdom, Japan, USA, Russia, France and Germany.
In 2013, exports from the cut flower sector are expected to reach some
USD 1 billion, compared to USD 692 million in 2011.

Kenya's cut-flower industry has performed well in terms of employment,
attracting investment, and adoption of efficient production methods. The
bulk of cut flower processing is done in Kenya and the industry now
employs close to half a million people. Notably, smallholder farmers in the
flower industry tend to profit more than those in the tea and coffee sectors.

The country has invested heavily in greenhouses, machinery, irrigation
systems, and in cold storage facilities. This vertically-integrated value chain
has allowed quick adjustment to market conditions and the rapid response
to changing consumer preferences and international competition. The cutflower business associations in the country have not only become strong
industry lobbyists, but also act as important agencies of self-regulation,
introducing codes of practice benchmarked to international best practices.
The associations work closely with government in promoting an enabling
environment for the development of the sector.

Box 2.2
Morocco’s Auto-Parts Industry

Morocco has identified the auto-parts industry as one of its most promising
job-creating sectors. It created the Tangier Automotive City and the Atlantic
Free Zone dedicated to the automotive industry, and introduced tax and
other incentives to attract investors. It has become, within a relatively
short time, Africa’s most important auto producer after South Africa. The
country has also in the process become one of Africa’s most diversified
economies, with skilled labour and good infrastructure. It is well positioned
to benefit greatly from the exploitation of this value chain. It has set itself
the goal of becoming a major and cost effective supplier of automotive
industry products to Europe.

By 2012, it was producing automobiles and spare parts through the
Société Marocaine de Constructions Automobiles, which has the capacity
to manufacture 90,000 vehicles a year, the majority for export. On the
other hand, Renault's car factory in Tangiers has the capacity to produce
400,000 vehicles a year.

Direct benefits to the wider economy have included the jobs generated
by the delivery of spare parts and finished vehicles to Renault's global
network. Local suppliers provide 42 percent of parts in Moroccan-made
Renault cars. The sector employs some 60,000 people and supports many
more jobs indirectly, including within the transport and shipping industry.

Though attractive as a concept, Special Economic Zones
(SEZs) have had a difficult history in Africa, mostly because
in the past they were seen in many countries as bureaucratic
initiatives, and not businesses ventures that would return a
profit or pay their way. Coupled with controls in the rest of
the economy, SEZs failed to deliver. However, in the much
changed policy environment of today, with a firm belief in the
value of competition and real business incentives in much of
Africa, SEZs could have a new lease of life. They have recently
gained attention in terms of economic diversification and job
creation. China is playing a large role in the development of
African SEZs, and the United States and the European Union
are also lending support.

Preliminary evidence from the new round of SEZs in Africa
indicates that they are creating new jobs, with workers in these
zones paid better than workers employed elsewhere. Ethiopia
is a good example—it has prioritized light manufacturing
growth, including the leather industry, as part of its economic
transformation program. For example, a SEZ run by a Chinese
firm outside the capital, Addis Ababa, is producing designer
shoes for the US and EU markets. Up to 25,000 jobs have
been created by linking production directly to global value
chains. In Ghana, the Tema Free Zone, a 480-hectare industrial

GVC Opportunities in Mining, Oil and Gas in Africa

The mining, oil and gas industries are among the most promising areas for
GVC development in the medium term. A cross-sectional review of African
countries reveals efforts to ensure that more value-added accrues to the
host countries. In Zambia, the government has taken a close look at royalties
and taxes within its mining sector—mainly copper—to ensure that the
sector makes a healthy contribution to the domestic economy, in terms of
revenue and also employment. Botswana closed the diamond value chain
by bringing the diamond cutting and sales division to the country. Large
gas discoveries have prompted the Government of Mozambique to look at
ways of retaining some of the benefits within country, and such initiatives
are apparent in the oil value chain in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon.

In East Africa, the discovery of oil and gas has led to a number of activities
aimed at greater economic integration and capturing as much value from
these activities as possible. Kenya has embarked on a new standard gauge
railway line from Mombasa, which will be extended subsequently to Uganda
and Rwanda. It has also broken ground on the construction of a new port
at Lamu that will service the northern parts of the country, South Sudan
and Ethiopian outlets to the sea. Uganda has delayed the exploitation of
crude oil from its new discoveries to the west of the country to build a
refinery to retain more of the value of the oil in the country.

Nigeria is looking to retain value within the country. Here, the most
notable examples have been Nigerian banks, but new ventures have
been launched in cement, oil and gas, including with the participation
of foreign investors.

The ability to generate value in the oil and gas sectors by domestic and
international players has helped countries such as Libya, Egypt and Cate
d'Ivoire preserve investor interest in their economies during turbulent periods.

park outside the capital, Accra, has created 30,000 jobs.
Smaller companies use the zone as a platform to link to global
production networks.

Global Value Chains and Industrial Development
Industrialization is a challenge and an opportunity for Africa.
Many countries are looking closely at the opportunities offered
by GVCs. At the lower end of the spectrum, African countries
are well integrated through their supply of basic inputs and
raw materials. More than 70 percent of Africa’s exports are
intermediate inputs from the extractive industries, for global
production of such items as copper wire, steel and petroleum.
Africa’s ambition is to surpass this stage, and ensure more
value addition to their production processes via fully-fledged
industrialization. Today, for example, Africa only adds value
to 14 percent of its exports compared with 27 percent for
emerging Asia and 31 percent for developed economies.

Annual Report 2013While Africa is the world’s largest producer of cocoa beans,
90 percent of the crop is exported in raw or semi-processed
form. The grinding of cocoa is done abroad. Cocoa growers
in West Africa receive approximately 5 percent of the price of
the finished chocolate bar. The bulk of the value in the cocoa
value chain accrues to firms outside producing countries.

Retaining more value from its natural resources within Africa is
important for the continent's future development and prosperity.
The issue is how to position production on the continent in
such a way as to create a profitable link with the much bigger
and stronger chains in the global economy.

In sum, how global value chains in Africa can serve as vehicles
for economic transformation is an important issue—the further
example of Lesotho is described in Box 2.4. Manufacturing
and related investments within value chains can be critical
sources of demand for other sectors of the economy such as
transport, banking, insurance and communication services.
They are highly important for Low-Income Countries. They can
create a basis for the development of agro-processing, with
considerable impact on job creation and reducing rural poverty.

2.5 GVCs and Industrialization:
Key Features for Public Policy

Success in the pursuit of GVCs for industrialization and structural
transformation will require well-defined actions by governments
to create an enabling and competitive environment. GVCs
will not happen in a vacuum and governments will play a key
role in formulating regulations, providing infrastructure and
ensuring that GVCs are well linked to the rest of the economy.
Information and knowledge on GVCs and trade more generally
will be crucial for planning and implementation.

The sections above have looked at a number of factors related
to the GVCs and how they can impact development in Africa by
unlocking its global potential, especially through the export of
goods and services with higher value added. In this subsequent
section, we discuss four implications for public policy.

The role of the state. Experience shows that breaking into
global markets does not simply happen by accident. It is
the product of careful planning, execution, and monitoring,
involving close collaboration between the government and
the private sector. The case of Morocco in the auto-parts
industry, detailed above, is a good example. It requires
sequenced movement from national competences to regional
and global ones. In all cases, a degree of experimentation
will be required, and success is not always assured. But
there are rewards to patience, flexibility and good execution.
The role of the state will also be crucial in reducing the cost
of doing business through physical infrastructure provision,

Global Value Chains and Africa’s Integration into the Global Economy Chapter 2

Box 2.4
The Apparel Sector in Lesotho

 

The apparel sector has assumed an important role in Lesotho’s economy.
The country has benefited from the evolution of two distinct value chain
investments. The first, run by South African and other foreign investors,
is based on producing for export to the United States through the
African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) initiative and has developed
sophisticated global sourcing and merchandising networks. The bulk of
its exports comprise casual and work-related apparel. In contrast, the
second is composed of firms that have left South Africa in search of lower
production costs. The firms involved here generally target the home market,
tend to respond quickly to shifts in demand there and supply products that
have moderately higher fashion content than in the first set. For South
African firms operating in Lesotho and exporting to the home market, the
monetary arrangements within the region imply that there are no currency
and related risks. The apparel sector now accounts for 18 percent of the
GDP of Lesotho, and the bulk of its manufacturing and exports. It employs
50 percent of the workforce.

especially power, and ensuring an adequate pool of skilled
and educated people.

Competitive environment. The “new” industrial policy sees
acrucial role for the government in promoting industrialization,
but the creation of a competitive environment is still the
most important factor in the process. African countries
need to know (i) what works “locally” in efforts to improve
the performance of existing industries, including issues of
infrastructure provision, access to financing, and ways of
establishing effective PPPs, (ii) what works “regionally and
globally” including “strategic bets” on new regional industries,
and (iii) how to create international coalitions to enable Africa
to make a real breakthrough in global trade. That will make it
possible for the continent to grow sectors where it enjoys a
comparative advantage —notably agro-processing.

Leveraging knowledge. The emergence of a knowledge-based
economy is the real difference between past industrialization
strategies and those of today. There is real time information
on the many changes taking place in the global economy,
making the process of adoption rapid, but also providing the
opportunity for rapid learning-by-doing and helping countries
to leapfrog to more sophisticated and productive niches.
This will dismantle barriers to entry, promote local research
and development, and encourage cross-fertilization of ideas
across countries, and regions.

Trade as gate opener. Unlocking Africa’s potential will

depend to a large extent on the Continent’s ability to trade
globally and regionally. Integration into global value chains

21Chapter 2 Global Value Chains and Africa’s Integration into the Global Economy

will require the expansion of trade networks to benefit from
scale economies. Simplifying trade and tariff policies between
African countries is also important.

2.6 Conclusion

This chapter has shown that GVCs have potential in Africa.
However, their full potential will not be realized, while African
countries are hampered by trade and investment difficulties,
including those with their immediate neighbours. It is important to
underline the importance of lowering trade barriers, investing in
people, building high quality infrastructure to foster competition
and enforcing contract compliance within the private sector,
while still considering social risk management and environmental
safeguards.

Wo

GVCs, however, are only one element in a much broader strategy
for Africa’s transformation. They must, at a minimum, directly
support Africa’s most important sectors, namely agriculture,
mining, oil and gas, manufacturing, and the SME sector. Today,
Africa is in a much better position to design initiatives that
will foster participation in GVCs than in the past, particularly
given the economic changes on the continent, including
its rising importance as a global consumer. To have lasting
impact however, GVCs must be able to help countries create
jobs. This will be the best way to ensure that the benefits of
growth are widely shared. The next chapter looks at how the
Bank is supporting GVCs through its projects and programs
and how it envisages their integration in its Ten-Year Strategy.

ae i. ial 1]Chapter 3. Enhancing Africa’s Global Potential: Bank’s Response

Global value chains are an important means for linking countries to global production and trade.
For them to have a positive impact on Africa’s transformation agenda, including industrialization,
adequate preparation by countries and their development partners, including the Bank Group
will be required. The issues to consider are how best to maximize benefits, such as technological upgrading and employment creation, from links to the global economy and how to enable
even those at the lowest rungs of the chains to benefit, such as farmers and employees in urban
industry. This chapter looks at what the Bank is doing through its own policies, programs and
operations, and its international partnerships and advocacy, to enable RMCs benefit from GVCs,
while avoiding the pitfalls identified in chapter 2, notably the risk of being locked into low productivity chains. It also examines the relevance of the Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy, and policies
related to the promotion of GVCs.

3.1 Policy Framework and Context

In 2018, the Bank launched its Ten-Year Strategy (TYS) with
the two pillars of inclusive growth and t he transition to green
growth to guide its work. A number of sector-focused policies
to accompany the TYS were also prepared to address issues
such as private sector development, regional integration,
agriculture and human development. Each of these areas is
important in the promotion of global value chains as well as
regional ones.

In terms of strategy and policy, Bank operations over the next
decade— including support for GVCs—will be guided by the
Bank's Ten-Year Strategy covering the period 2013-2022. The
main thrust of the strategy is Africa’s transformation, as the
key means of improving social welfare and quality of growth
and development. It emphasizes inclusive growth, and the
transitioning to green growth. The TYS has five priority areas:
infrastructure, regional integration, private sector development,
governance and accountability, and skills and technology;
it also focuses on three areas of special emphasis: Fragile
States, gender, and agriculture and food security. Besides
the TYS, the Bank has also introduced a number of sector
strategies that provide further detail on the quality of the Bank’s
interventions in the medium term to ensure a holistic approach.
With regard to GVCs and industrialization, the most important
of these strategies are those for Private Sector Development,
Regional Integration, Human Capital Development and the
Agricultural Sector (Box 3.1). The Bank is formulating a new
Regional Integration Strategy for the period 2014 to 2023, which
emphasizes the role of GVCs. Energy, for which a new strategy
has been developed by the Bank, is also important. However,

24

as mentioned in chapter 2, GVCs cannot be undertaken in
isolation and strategies and policies linked to other areas such
as transport and communications, governance and institutional
development are also crucial for success.

The Bank and other financiers have helped some Regional
Member Countries create the physical and policy structures
needed to support GVC-related projects. For example, it
has provided direct funding or advisory services during the
construction of a number of special economic zones (SEZs)
in Ethiopia, Ghana, Morocco, and Zambia. SEZs provide
employment and incomes.

3.2 Bank Group Operations and GVCs

Bank operations show that even when not designated as
GVC-promoting initiatives, they have much in common with
the idea of enabling countries to maximize the benefits of their
comparative advantage and links to the global economy. A
number of Bank projects and activities, with implications for
GVCs, have been registered in agriculture, transport, ICT and
other publicly-financed operations, as well as within the private
sector. Still, a more formal approach to GVCs, backed up by
a stock of knowledge work within the Bank, will be required
to realize the ambition of enhancing Africa’s global potential.

The Bank recognizes the importance and value of GVCs for the
continued development of Africa in a globalizing world. Within
the Bank, a number of activities with implications for GVCs
have been registered in the areas of agriculture, transport, ICT
and other public operations, as well as within its private sector
operations. These are discussed in the sections that follow:

Annual Report 2013Agriculture and related areas. The Bank’s current agriculture
portfolio demonstrates the success achieved through the
use of the integrated value chain approach to strengthen
its operations in Africa’s agriculture and food industry. The
approach emphasizes strong linkages between agricultural
production and market outlets, with a view to job creation,
higher household incomes, and food security. It also promotes
product diversification and provides a basis for industrialization.
This has in turn strengthened linkages between farmers and
agro-industries, enhanced supply-chain efficiencies and
reduced post-harvest losses. Examples of Bank operations in
agriculture include the Community Agriculture and Infrastructure
Improvement Project in Uganda, which won the US Treasury
Award in 2013 for the impact it had on the lives of farmers,
through its value chain approach; and the Nigerian Agricultural
Transformation Agenda Support Program. The latter supports
the Nigerian Government’s ambition to create value chains in
agriculture from farm-level production to finished manufactured
products. These examples resonate with the Bank’s Ten-Year
Strategy which views agriculture as a business rather than
merely as a development project.

 

However, domestic value chains in agriculture have been
slow in acquiring a global dimension. This is partly due to
constraints on global food trade, for example those on bananas
and manufactured food products, but also due to insufficient
nowledge of the opportunities in the marketplace. In the
coffee sector, for example, better marketing targeted at the
final consumer in developed and emerging economies has
expanded product outlets and increased the income of coffee
armers in a number of African countries. This more activist
approach to creating value for African products at the global
evel will require more structured support in the medium term.

Private sector. The Bank’s private sector operations are a
ey conduit for support, directly or indirectly, to GVCs in Africa.
Many recent operations in trade finance as well as co-financing
operations with other institutions have been designed with this
dimension in mind. One of the most important interventions
here is the Bank’s support for funds for Africa’s small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), through direct lending or
equity participation or lines of credit to more commerciallyoriented banks. Private sector financing of Africa’s modernizing
agricultural sector is an important feature. For example, in 2012,
the Bank established the Agvance Africa Fund of Funds to
help scale up private sector financing to African agriculture —
focusing on the value chain approach to cover the whole of
the production and marketing chain. Such assistance has
the potential to link African value chains more directly to their
global counterparts, bringing on board the efficiencies and
knowledge needed for global competitiveness. Other recent
examples of private sector operations related to agriculture,
with high potential to enhance GVCs, include direct support

Enhancing Africa’s Global Potential: Bank’s Response Chapter 3

Box 3.1
Global Value Chain Links in Bank Group Strategies

Ten-Year Strategy, 2013-2022. The strategy touches on a number of
aspects closely related to global value chains, including how private sectorled development can accelerate value chain development, particularly in
the extractive and agribusiness sectors. It emphasizes the importance of
transforming primary products into manufactured products and underlines
the importance of integrating value chains in agriculture to ensure food
security and livelihoods. It also sees infrastructure development as a key
component for enhancing value chain development.

Private Sector Development Strategy, 2013-2017. This strategy
emphasizes market access, particularly for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) in agribusiness and support for regional value chain
development to promote regional integration. It advocates raising capacities
through better access to information and knowledge and developing local
skills and technological capabilities to improve competitiveness. The
strategy also lays a sound basis for Bank financing of large multinational
infrastructure projects, through co-financing and public-private partnerships.

 

Agricultural Sector Strategy, 2010-2014. The focus of this strategy is
to raise agricultural productivity and increase incomes and employment
through the introduction of new technologies. It also seeks to boost SMEs
in agribusiness. The strategy highlights the importance of developing,
packaging and processing functions, improving storage and rural infrastructure
facilities, and reducing post-harvest losses. It also suggests how best
to link producers to local and regional markets through the value chain
approach—from production to processing, packaging and storage, and
transportation to market.

Regional Integration Strategy, 2009-2013. The strategy envisions the
integration of macroeconomic policy and infrastructure policies, especially
transport and power interconnections, to boost regional value chains and
link Africa to global value chains. The strategy supports intra-regional
trade and investment, and mechanisms to increase the share of African
exports in world trade, thereby enhancing Africa’s presence in the global
marketplace. Among the crucial factors to consider are sound national
and sub-regional macroeconomic and trade policies—including realistic
convergence criteria—and the attraction of foreign direct investment flows
to accelerate technology transfer. The new Regional Integration Strategy,
2014-2023, is under preparation.

Human Capital Development Strategy, 2012-2016. The experience of
emerging economies has shown that a well-trained and skilled labour force
enhances competitiveness. This points to the importance of developing
human resources through better education and healthcare, if countries
wish to move up the value chain and become efficient and innovation driven
economies. This will require investment in education, nutrition and health,
and in science and technology. The strategy also considers investments
in social protection measures.

Box 3.2
ASDB Trade Finance Program

In 2013, the Bank Group established the Trade Finance Program, worth
USD 1 billion, to cover an initial period of four years. The program provides
three products: risk participation, soft commodity financing and trade
finance lines of credit. The bulk of the operations is targeted at Low-Income
Countries, local African banks, small and medium enterprises in agriculture,
agribusiness, light-manufacturing and intermediate and capital goods
production. The goal of the program is to reduce the trade finance gap in
Africa by “crowding in” global banks and strengthening African financial
institutions that are critical to the promotion of trade. The program also
seeks to promote regional integration and intra-African trade.

The Bank approved seven operations amounting to USD 592.6 million
under this program in 2013. For details see http://www.afdb.org/en/
topics-and-sectors/initiatives-partnerships/trade-finance-program/

to Nigeria’s fertilizer production (Indorama Fertilizer Plant) and
agribusiness (Olam Group Africa Program). The Bank has also
established a Trade Finance Program to address issues related
to the shortage of trade finance in Africa revealed during the
economic and financial crises (Box 3.2).

Africa50 and other financing instruments. |n 2013, the Bank
Group initiated the AfricaS0 fund, which will draw financing from
African sources, for example, pension funds, supplemented by
argeted investment from abroad to finance “game-changing”
projects in infrastructure on the continent. Through this, Africa50
will be inextricably linked to the development of GVCs. The
Bank's Microfinance Capacity Building Trust Fund is helping
‘© promote financial inclusion, intra-regional trade, and the
facilitation of migrant remittances—increasing the security
of flows while drastically lowering transaction costs. The
Bank’s Africa Trade Fund, established with support from the
Canadian government, is an important facility for enhancing
rade performance in RMCs.

Regional integration and trade. The promotion of global value
chains is also important within the scope of regional integration.
n 2009, the Bank introduced Regional Integration Strategy
Papers (RISPs) as a framework for driving Bank activities in
he area of economic integration. The Bank’s emphasis has
been mainly on regional infrastructure, principally power and
ransport, with the goal of reducing the cost of doing business
and linking landlocked countries to the sea. The Bank also
hosts a number of Africa-wide initiatives targeting integration.
Such initiatives include the implementation of the Program
or Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA); the facility
or project preparation for regional infrastructure projects
(NEPAD-IPPF), and, in general, issues of trade facilitation

 

26

and financial integration. Also notable is the Infrastructure
Consortium for Africa (ICA), a knowledge and informationsharing platform established by the G8 and endorsed by
the G20 to facilitate access to information on infrastructure
on the continent.

Support to Regional Economic Communities (RECs). The
Bank's support for Regional Economic Communities has included
capacity-building programs, notably the Tripartite Capacity Building
Program for the Southern African Development Community
(SADC), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) and the East African Community (EAC). There is
also direct support to trade-related institutions in countries
emerging from political and economic fragility, such as Liberia.
Support for financial integration has focused on payments
systems; harmonization of capital markets and bond regulations;
development of innovative financial products and vehicles, and
supporting systems for macroeconomic convergence.

3.3 Bank’s Knowledge Management,
Capacity Building and Advocacy

As a development finance institution, the Bank undertakes
research and capacity building, provides advisory services, and
conducts policy dialogue with member countries. It partners
with institutions in Africa and elsewhere to impart knowledge
on best practices in development. It also collects statistics
that are useful in conducting research on Africa’s trade and
industrialization. During 2013, the Bank undertook a number
of studies on global value chains and related issues.

Much of the knowledge work pursued in the Bank Group in
2013 was closely related to the theme of this Annual Report—
the various ways of enhancing Africa’s global potential, including
through GVCs. The Bank’s Evaluation Department (OPEV)
has also undertaken a number of knowledge studies, based
on the Bank’s project cycle.

In particular, the African Development Report for 2013/14
looks at regional integration, with a particular focus on
GVCs. The African Economic Outlook 2014, undertaken
in collaboration with the the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), has a thematic focus on
global value chains and their implications for Africa’s structural
transformation and development. The themes also featured in
the year’s African Competitiveness Report, and issues of
the African Development Review. The Bank has completed
anew Governance Strategic Framework and Action Plan,
the vision of which is an Africa governed by transparent,
accountable and responsive governments, including strong
institutions capable of driving inclusive and sustainable growth.
It also completed the Annual Development Effectiveness

Annual Report 2013Review, which stresses that Africa’s longer-term growth
trajectory is closely tied to the sustainable management of
its natural resources. The Bank held the African Economic
Conference 2013 in Johannesburg in October, with the theme
of regional economic integration.

The Bank undertook joint studies with other institutions on
regional integration and trade; education and skills; and social
protection, among others. In particular, it studied the paradox
of why there is so little industrialization in Africa, in spite of
similar conditions in Asia, when that region embarked on its
own transformation process. Box 3.3 outlines results from
the project “learning to compete” in Africa.

In 2018, the Bank’s African Development Institute (EADI)
pursued a number of initiatives for capacity building, many
of them directly related to the theme of raising Africa’s global
potential. It established the elnstitute, http://einstitute.afdb.org;
and the EADI knowledge portal, http://institute.afdb.org, to
contribute to this agenda. It worked with African think-tanks
to debate Africa’s development, including a seminar at the
African Economic Conference held in 2013, on the subject
of regional integration.

The growing importance of Islamic financing instruments
such as Sukuk, and the increased interest among the RMCs
in leveraging them, has prompted the Bank to develop the
capacity of Bank staff and the RMCs in this domain through
workshops, learning events and knowledge products. In this
regard, the Bank has developed collaborative partnerships for
capacity development with the Islamic Research and Training
Institute of the Islamic Development Bank and the International
Islamic Liquidity Management Corporation.

The Bank continues to be a leading supporter of statistical
capacity building in the RMCs. Apart from direct support to
sub-regional institutions and in-country statistical training
centres to improve data dissemination systems, the Bank
has also provided technical assistance to countries on
macroeconomic data dissemination, including sharing the
Open Data Platform, in partnership with the International
Monetary Fund. The Bank also compiled data on intra-regional
trade. In particular, it created a harmonized consumer price
index, which is very important for assessing the level of
regional economic integration and convergence. Recognizing
the importance of infrastructure, the Bank hosts the Africa
Infrastructure Knowledge Program, which supports the
collection of infrastructure statistics and the monitoring of
the fiscal implications of infrastructure in RMCs.

The importance of knowledge management for the Bank’s

operations and capacity building and policy dialogue necessitated
the establishment of a Knowledge Management Strategy

“Leaming to Compete”: Results From a Collaborative
Research Project

The purpose of this collaborative research project between the Bank,
the Brookings Institution and the UN’s World Institute for Development
Economics Research was to examine why industrialization has been so
slow to happen in Africa, when much of the rest of the world has successfully industrialized, most recently Asia.

The study responds to five queries: the role of exports in Africa’s industrialization process, whether lack of skills constrains Africa’s ability to compete,
whether Africa can compete without industrial clusters, how FDI can help
build Africa’s industrial capacity, and the role of industrial policy. The study
is based on nine country cases drawn from all of Africa’s sub-regions.

The study notes that Africa has actually been “de-industrializing” in the
past decade. Its exports are less diverse and less sophisticated than they
were 30 years ago. It argues that Africa’s “employment problem” is an
industrialization problem. It argues further that the economies of agglomerations for industrialization and ability to compete are important and
must be encouraged. Above all, the study underlines the importance of
governance. Reducing the level and incidence of bribery by public officials
facilitates a more efficient allocation of capital and supports nimbler firms
that can handle the challenges of GVCs and globalization.

(KMS) to cover 2014-2018. The goal of the KMS is to leverage
knowledge Bank-wide to enhance the development impact
of lending operations, and raise the quality and effectiveness
of its policy dialogue and advice to African countries. Above
all, the KMS will emphasize knowledge generation as a key
part of Bank operations, subject to the same measures of
effectiveness and relevance as other Bank activities.

Closely linked to knowledge activities is the Information
Disclosure Policy of the Bank, which was rolled out during
2013. The policy reinforces the Bank’s policy of transparency
in line with other multilateral development banks, and is in
accordance with international best practice.

3.4. Looking Ahead

GVCs have become an important means of production and
trade. The Bank's support to the process is already evident in the
emphasis of its strategies as well as its lending. African countries
will need all the support they can get to link to GVCs in a profitable
manner, especially in gauging points of entry and the viability
of the chains in terms of development needs. Research and
analytical work as well as the sharing of experiences will be vital.

This chapter has reviewed what the Bank Group is doing to
boost Africa’s global potential, in particular, how its operations

9}.Chapter 3. Enhancing Africa’s Global Potential: Bank’s Response

and policy advice are helping to link countries to global value
chains. GVCs are complex and multifaceted mechanisms,
with the right mix of policies and instruments varying from
country to country, continent to continent, and from one
market to the other. What might be good for the coffee value
chain might be very different from what is good for bananas
or flowers. The composition of actors, including governments,
the private sector, and households, also varies with product
type. There is therefore no “right policy”, or “interventions
mix” when it comes to GVCs, thereby enabling a fair amount
of domestic innovation and experimentation. However, two
important factors are the supportive role of the public sector,
especially in undertaking cost benefit analyses and regulatory
frameworks, and the importance of taking into account the
regional dimension—experience indicates that countries ina
given region tend to move together when it comes to GVCs.

The Bank’s support to GVCs is already implicit in its operations,
from its support for large infrastructure projects that lower
the cost of doing business, to targeted support for key
aspects of the agriculture value chain, and to its support for
regional integration. But as GVCs become a strong factor in
Africa’s participation in the global economy, the Bank Group’s
interventions will have to be scaled up, and become explicit
and better targeted. The review above suggest that while
countries and regional communities are willing to engage
in GVCs, much needs to be done at national and regional
levels to enhance the planning as well as capacity building,
required for success. For the Bank Group, making GVCs a
reality will call for a “One Bank approach” that brings on board
the full complement of its resources, from lending to capacity
building and technical assistance, to help countries extract
maximum benefits from the chains. The Bank’s support for
“soft” infrastructure, including legal and regulatory systems,
and good governance and accountability, especially in the
management of natural resources, will be important.

Knowledge generation and dissemination will also be important
for the success of GVCs and for raising Africa’s global potential.
Upstream analytical work with strong links to Bank operations
as well as cutting-edge research on GVCs will be required.
Such work will be disseminated widely through workshops
at the national and regional levels to generate ideas and
implementation strategies.

Part Il of the report, which follows, presents the Bank’s
operational and corporate activities in 2013. It highlights
the most innovative initiatives undertaken during the year in
response to the changing needs of African countries, and
how the Bank and its partners are helping to enhance Africa’s
global potential.

The overall performance of the Bank Group in 2013 remained largely unchanged from that in
2012. However, the operational environment was more difficult, with some traditionally strong
clients affected by economic and social disruption. The decline in ADB window operations, in
spite of robust private sector lending, highlighted the need to take action to find new clients,
create new modalities and to develop strong business pipelines in the period ahead. The year
witnessed a strong performance from the African Development Fund, while the Bank Group
also completed a successful ADF-13 Replenishment. 2013 marked the first year of the implementation of the Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy for 2013 to 2022, approved by the Board in April,
with the two objectives of economic inclusion and transition to green growth. Selectivity and
focus continued to be major themes. During the year, the Bank received two awards from the
US Treasury’s competition for multilateral development banks, the first time two projects from
the same Bank have won in the same year.

3.56 billion (81.2 percent) was in the form of loans and grants,

41 Overview of Bank Group Operations

Overall, there was little change in Bank Group operations in
2013 compared to 2012, although there were notable variations
between the ADB and ADF windows. The sovereign part of
the ADB window saw a reduction, while its private sector
counterpart met its targets. During 2013, ADF lending exceeded
that of the ADB for the first time in the Bank Group’s history.
In 2013, total Bank Group operations amounted to UA 4.39
billion, an increase of 3.1 percent compared to 2012. ADF
operations amounted to UA 2.27 billion in 2013, an increase
of 20.1 percent over 2012. ADB operations amounted to UA
1.88 billion, a decline of 12.0 percent compared to 2012, due
to the disruptions mentioned above. Infrastructure, mostly
transport and energy, received the bulk of the resources.

Overview. Total approvals during 2008-2013 indicate that
the Bank Group played an important counter-cyclical role in
financing its Regional Member Countries in the past decade. For
example, total lending as presented in Figure 4.1 was UA 8.06
billion in 2009, the peak of the global financial crisis. The Bank
devised measures, including quick disbursing budget support
operations, and short-term trade and liquidity facilities to meet
increased demand from RMCs. Bank Group approvals have since
returned to normal levels, with total annual approvals between
UA 4 billion and 6 billion. For 2013, approvals amounted to
UA 4.39 billion, an increase of 3.1 percent compared to 2012.
Total ADF approvals were UA 2.27 billion, an increase of 20.1
percent over 2012. However, ADB approvals amounted to UA
1.83 billion, representing a reduction of 12.0 percent compared
to 2012. Of the Bank Group approvals of UA 4.39 billion, UA

32

and the remaining UA 824.7 million (18.8 percent) comprised
debt relief, private sector equity participation, guarantees,
reallocation and allocations to Special Funds.

Economic and political disruption affected major borrowers
from the ADB window, and led to downward adjustments in
their ratings with implications for Bank lending. Although the
ADB sovereign window achieved only 39.4 percent of its UA
1.7 billion target, the ADB private sector window met its target
of UA 1.1 billion. The challenge ahead is how to generate new
business for both the sovereign and private sector windows.
During 2013, the Bank’s management explored a number of

Annual Report 2013approaches. They are still under consideration, but provide the
following useful pointers to the options available to the Bank:

(i) Amend the Bank's credit policy to allow countries, currently
confined to the ADF window to, under well-stipulated
conditions, access ADB resources;

(ii) Scale-up public-private partnerships and co-financing
opportunities to increase sovereign financing from the
ADB window; and

(ili) Explore new sources of financing and partnerships ranging
from equity and pension funds to engaging key emerging
countries.

During 2013, approvals from the Nigeria Trust Fund window
more than doubled to UA 31.2 million, compared to UA 14.1
million in 2012.

Approvals from Special Funds amounted to UA 253.4 million
in 2013, a decline of 5.8 percent compared to 2012. Special
Funds are an important element of Bank operations, supporting
a range of initiatives crucial to meeting targets. In 2013,
Special Funds included the African Water Facility, the Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative, the Global Environment
Facility, the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program,
he Climate Investment Funds, the Sustainable Energy Fund
for Africa, the Middle East and North Africa Transition Fund,
he Congo Basin Forests Fund, the Fund for African Private
Sector Assistance, the Microfinance Capacity Building Fund,
the Governance Trust Fund, the Trust Fund for Countries in
Transition, the Africa Trade Fund and the Zimbabwe MultiDonor Trust Fund.

In 2013, Comoros reached the Highly Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) completion point, and qualified for irrevocable debt
relief of VA 22.32 million under the enhanced HIPC initiative:
UA 12.68 million debt relief from the ADB window and UA
9.64 million from the ADF window, respectively.

 

Summary of Bank Group operations by sector. Bank Group
operations by sector, presented in Figures 4.2(a), 4.2(b) and
4.2(c), with details in Table 4.1, indicate that selectivity and a
focus on results continued to guide Bank Group operations
in 2018.

Infrastructure approvals amounted to UA 2.05 billion (57.6
percent of total approvals). It accounted for 39.6 percent (UA
564.9 million) of ADB approvals and 69.7 percent (UA 1.47
billion) of ADF approvals. Transport was the dominant subsector
followed by energy, and water and sanitation (Figure 4.2(a)).

Finance operations comprising lines of credit, trade finance,

and support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
were significant in the ADB window, but not in the ADF window.

On the other hand, approvals for water supply and sanitation
were only significant at the ADF window.

Bank Group interventions in agriculture and rural development
amounted to UA 428.7 million or 12 percent of total approvals.
They encompassed a range of projects and programs in
irrigation, water storage and management; rural power supply;
rural and community roads (including maintenance); marketing
and storage facilities; and agro-processing. Multisector
operations, involving two or more sectors, accounted for UA
449.2 million or 12.6 percent of total approvals in 2013. They

targeted improvements in public financial management and
institutional reforms. Finance sector operations accounted for
UA 288 million (8.1 percent) for the Bank Group, consisting
of lines of credit targeted at SMEs, equity participation, and
financial guarantees to private enterprises and to multinational
projects to promote regional integration. Bank Group lending
targeted at the environment amounted to UA 9.2 million.

Bank clients. In 2018, infrastructure (energy and transport)
represented the largest share of total NTF approvals, amounting
to UA 19.7 million or 63.1 percent (Figure 4.3). Smaller amounts
went to agriculture and multisector operations.

ADB loan and grant approvals by country. Total ADB loan
and grant approvals amounted to UA 1.43 billion in 2013, with
55 percent going to sovereign and the rest to private sector
operations. Figure 4.4 indicates that the largest recipients
were Nigeria, Morocco and Namibia. Multinational operations,
notably equity participation and trade finance, were also
significant. Private sector resources supported a number of
ADF recipients, Kenya, Zambia, Cdte d’lvoire, Ghana, Niger
and Tanzania.

ADF loan and grant approvals by country. Figure 4.5 shows
that 35 countries had access to ADF-financed operations.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya and Mali led
the group, with a number of other countries receiving smaller
amounts from this concessional window. In total, ADF loan
and grant approvals amounted to UA 2.10 billion, 67.6 percent
in loans and the rest in grants.

Bank Group disbursements. The rate of disbursement of
Bank Group loans and grants slowed during 2013, recording
UA 3.13 billion as opposed to UA 3.38 billion in 2012. As at
end December 2013, cumulative disbursements (including
non-sovereign loans) amounted to UA 45.66 billion (UA 42.53
billion in 2012). At the end of 2013 a total of 2,943 loans
had been fully disbursed, amounting to UA 38.2 billion, and
representing 83.7 percent of cumulative disbursements (87.7
percent in 2012).

Leveraging resources and partnerships. The Bank manages
a total of 31 Trust Funds: 16 thematic and 15 bilateral. Finland,
Japan, India, Korea, Nigeria and Portugal have designated
bilateral trust funds. At the end of 2013, total commitments
of bilateral trust funds amounted to UA 7.03 million. Total
approvals from these funds were UA 3.37 million in 2013.

Figure 4.6 indicates that the approvals were well aligned with
the priorities of the Ten-Year Strategy, with the largest share
going to infrastructure, followed by agriculture, skills and
knowledge products, green growth, governance and private
sector development.

Thematic trust funds mobilized UA 72.2 million from seven
donor agencies in 2013. They were the Austria Development
Agency, the UK’s Department for International Development,
the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,
the US Agency for International Development, the Norwegian
Agency for Development Cooperation, the Global Alliance
for Vaccine and Immunization, and the Nordic Development
Fund. Other contributions were from Switzerland, Denmark
and The Netherlands. Figure 4.7 shows that their support
was well aligned with the TYS.

The Bank Group and the HIPC process. Over the past 15
years, the Bank Group has supported the enhanced Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) and the Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Comoros reached the HIPC
completion point and qualified for irrevocable debt relief
and debt cancellation, in which the Bank participated as
indicated above. Simultaneously, Comoros also benefitted
from the cancellation of its ADF loans amounting to USD 30
million under the MDRI. Thus, by the end of 2013, 29 out
of 33 RMCs eligible for HIPC/MDRI debt relief had received
support. Chad is the only country from the interim phase of
the HIPC process that has yet to reach completion point.
Three pre-decision point countries—Eritrea, Somalia, and
Sudan—have not yet embarked on the process of qualifying
for debt relief under the Initiative. Zimbabwe could be added
to the list of countries eligible for HIPC assistance, if ongoing
assessments confirm its eligibility.

4.2 Bank Group Operations by Sub-region

The year 2013 witnessed substantial variation in Bank Group
operations by sub-region. North Africa, as already indicated,
experienced further socio-economic disruption, which affected
operations. Southern Africa, another region with a number of
Middle-Income economies, was making considerable efforts to
return to high growth. For the Bank Group, it offered prospects
for operational diversification. West Africa continued to enjoy
a prolonged natural resource boom, with spillovers into the
financial and manufacturing sectors, which resulted in higher
demand for resources from the Bank. East Africa's economies
kept a relatively high pace of Bank operations, with many
multinational projects financed as well. Central Africa, with
a concentration of contlict-affected economies, witnessed
a reduction of Bank investment. Private sector lending was
well distributed in most sub-regions.

Bank Group loan and grant approvals by sub-region.
Figure 4.8 shows the distribution of Bank Group operations
by sub-region, while Table 4.2 provides a more detailed
overview.

Central Africa. The sub-region has eight countries. Of these,
Gabon and Equatorial Guinea are the only category C countries
in the group, eligible to borrow from the sovereign resources
of the ADB window, while the rest are ADF-only (Table 4.2).
They can, like other ADF-only countries, nevertheless borrow
from the ADB window to finance private sector operations and
enclave projects. Among the ADF-only countries, five are postconflict and/or conflict-affected countries. These are Central
African Republic, Chad, the Republic of Congo, the Democratic

Annual Report 2013

Republic of the Congo, and Sao Tomé & Principe. In 2018,
total loan and grant approvals for the sub-region declined
by 24.5 percent to UA 243.9 million due to socio-economic
disruptions that impeded operations. Operations were in
three sectors: infrastructure (water and sanitation, transport
and energy), accounting for 79.5 percent, multisector (13.6
percent) and agriculture and rural development (6.9 percent).

East Africa. The sub-region has 12 countries, with Seychelles
being the only country eligible to borrow from the ADB
sovereign window. In 2013, total loan and grant approvals
amounted to UA 597.3 million, an increase of 33.6 percent
over 2012 (Table 4.2). Infrastructure accounted for 80.2
percent of total approvals, including transport, energy, and
water and sanitation. The private sector component of the
Lake Turkana Wind Power Project in northern Kenya, at UA
98.3 million, is the largest non-sovereign Bank operation,

3}Chapter 4 Bank Group Operations

approved in the sub-region so far. The project will reduce the
energy gap in the country, enhance energy diversification and
prevent the emission of 16 million tons of CO2 compared to
a fossil fuel-fired power plant. On completion, it will be the
largest wind power project in Africa. Notably, the Uganda
Community Agricultural Infrastructure Program (CAIIP-1)
was one of two Bank operations that won a US Treasury
Award for its inclusiveness and overall impact on poverty
reduction in 2013.

North Africa. This sub-region constitutes six countries; all
are ADB-only countries with the exception of Mauritania,
which is an ADF-only country. Libya has never borrowed
from the Bank, while Algeria suspended borrowing from
multilateral and bilateral donors in 2006. Owing to the political
disruptions mentioned above, the share of North Africa in
total borrowing from the Bank declined from 31 percent in
2012 to 6.4 percent in 2013, equivalent to UA 886.7 million.
Bank interventions were mainly in the social sector (89.6
percent), but agriculture received 8.5 percent. Infrastructure,
the main basis for previous lending, did not feature in the
lending to the region in 2013.

Southern Africa. Of the 12 countries in this sub-region,
six are ADB-only countries while the other six are ADF-only
countries (Table 4.2). Total approvals amounted to UA 615.2
million and infrastructure (transport, energy, ITC, water and
sanitation) received 62.6 percent, followed by finance with
16.3 percent. These included two infrastructure projects in
Zimbabwe and one green growth project in Zambia. The
Zimbabwe projects funded by the Zimbabwe Multi-Donor
Trust Fund included: (i) Urgent Water Supply and Sanitation
Rehabilitation Project and, (ii) Emergency Power Infrastructure
Rehabilitation Project. The Zambia project funded by the
Climate Investment Funds is for strengthening climate
resilience in the Kafue Sub-Basin.

West Africa. This sub-region has a total of 15 countries,
five of which are considered to be fragile states, or countries
emerging from conflict, and hence with access to the Bank’s
Fragile States Facility, a curve-out from the ADF. Apart from
Cabo Verde, which recently graduated to ADB country status,
and Nigeria, which is a blend with access to both windows,
the rest are ADF-only countries. Total approvals amounted
to UA 991 million in 2013. Infrastructure (energy, water and
sanitation, and transport) received 31.9 percent, followed
by multisector with 30.2 percent, and agriculture and rural
development, with 26 percent. Interventions in Nigeria, which
helped boost the total for the sub-region, included projects
in transport and governance, and support for agricultural
transformation. In addition, a fertilizer project was supported
by the private sector.

4.3 Bank Group Operations by Priority and
Areas of Special Emphasis

The Ten-Year Strategy (TYS) for 2013 to 2022 lays out
the Bank’s priorities and areas of special emphasis. Their
implementation called for broad collaboration across the Bank,
innovative approaches in project implementation and policy
dialogue, and for the Bank’s full complement of experience,
partnerships and knowledge.

Inclusive growth and transition to green growth. The
Bank financed a number of operations that meet the TYS’s
two objectives of inclusive growth and transition to green
growth during 2013. The Inclusive Growth and Economic
Competitiveness Support Program in Senegal, a budget support
program, was jointly financed by an ADF loan (UA 25.5 million)
and an International Development Association loan (UA 19.9
million). The aim of the project is to promote efficiency, equity
and transparency in public resource management, with a gender
dimension for all public policies. The African Water Facility is
undertaking sanitation projects in ten RMCs that incorporate
women and youth, and the goal is to enhance income equality
between social groups, especially with a focus on gender
balance. Of the nearly 1,000 jobs expected from the projects,
almost half will go to women. By targeting cities in conflictaffected countries, new small-scale businesses, suitable for
young entrepreneurs, will be created in the sanitation sector.

In the area of green growth, the Bank Group is working with
Djibouti to develop a 50 MW power plant to boost the country’s
capacity for energy generation from renewable resources. It is
also assisting Comoros to develop a 20 MW geothermal plant.
In Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Tanzania, the Bank is providing support
for policy development, including the preparation of geothermal
development roadmaps. The Bank also undertook dialogue and
advocacy on green growth at various international meetings.
Bank staff attended the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change held in Warsaw, Poland, in November 2013
and addressed Africa’s transition to green growth. During the
year, the Bank's Climate Investment Funds financed a number
of environment and climate change related projects. Six projects
in the area of green growth were approved with total funding of
UA 82.9 million. The Climate Investment Funds also financed
projects in agriculture. These projects in Ghana, Burkina Faso
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are focused on
reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation
(REDD+), and hence include integrated REDD+ elements such
as addressing the drivers of deforestation, carbon sequestration
through afforestation, reforestation and forest management,
sustainable agriculture and other livelihood improvement activities.

Transport, ICT and related infrastructure. Approvals for
infrastructure amounted to UA 2.05 billion, of which transport

Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The expansion program financed by the Bank will raise the container
throughput capacity from 355,000 TEUs to 1,005,000 TEUs and will be
implemented over a period of three years. On completion, the port will be
generally more efficient and handle a higher volume of cargo. Knock-on
benefits will include better regional trade and integration, development
of the private sector in Namibia, along the corridor and in the interior, and
employment creation. The Bank will contribute UA 198.4 million, representing more than 86 percent of the total project cost of UA 229.6 million.

40 Annual Report 2013Bank Group Operations Chapter 4

Another multinational project on which the Bank has embarked
20x 4.2 in a public-private-partnership is the Grand Inga 3 Hydroelectric
Inga Site Development and Electricity Access Support project in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Bank has
Project (PASEL) contributed UA 44.4 million towards the preparation of the
first phase of the project which will eventually have a powergenerating capacity of 4,800 MW on the Inga site and power
transmission lines that will supply electricity at home and also

export to South Africa (Box 4.2).

The Grand Inga Hydro Power Plant is located on the banks of the River
Congo in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is estimated that when
the multi-dam project is fully developed it could have a power generation
capacity exceeding 44,000 MW—half Africa’s current installed electricity

capacity. Inga is one of the game-changing projects of the future. oo
Water and sanitation. |n 2013, Bank Group approvals

for water supply and sanitation operations amounted to
UA 356.8 million, including the use of special funds of
UA 58.3 million. The funds are channeled through three
complementary initiatives hosted by the Bank: the Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI), the African
Water Facility (AWF), and the Multi-Donor Water Partnership
Program (MDWPP). The initiatives enhance the effectiveness
of the Bank’s work and provide resources for increasing
access to safe water and sanitation, promoting innovative
technologies and supporting water-related knowledge
management activities (Box 4.3).

PASEL will finalize the preparation of the first phase of Inga 3, which will
include the development of a power-generating capacity of 4,800 MW on
the Inga site and the building of power transmission lines to supply electricity to the country and for export to South Africa. The proposed project
will increase access to more reliable and cheaper energy in the DRC, raise
coverage from the current 9 to over 40 percent by 2020. Itis also expected
to improve the business climate and productivity of the economies of the
region. The demand for electricity is high throughout the region, guaranteeing a market for the energy produced. South Africa has already signed an
agreement with the DRC to import about half of the electricity generated.

Box 4.3
The Three Water Initiatives

The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI). The
aim of RWSSI is to increase access to drinking water and sanitation
in rural Africa to attain the African Water Vision of 2025 and the MDG
targets for 2015. Since its launch in 2003, the Bank has invested on
its part UA 860 million in co-financing 39 programs in 29 countries.
The Initiative has been able to leverage more than UA 3.1 billion from
other donors, governments and communities while the RWSSI Trust Fund
has contributed UA 107 million. This funding has provided water to 66
million people and sanitation to 49 million. In 2013, six new RWSSI
projects were approved for the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Djibouti, Lesotho, Mauritania, Sierra Leone, and Sao Tomé & Principe.
The funds will boost sector coordination and governance, strengthen
country-led monitoring and evaluation, and promote sanitation at both
the community and household levels. To improve learning and enhance
the sustainability of rural water and sanitation investments, the Bank has
encouraged knowledge sharing and the dissemination of good practices
across the whole RWSSI portfolio.

The African Water Facility (AWF). The AWF is a multilateral special
water fund, established in 2004 at the request of the African Ministers’
Council on Water (AMCOW), and hosted and administered by AfDB. It is a
catalytic instrument focused on leveraging investments to help achieve the
Objectives of the Africa Water Vision 2025. To date, about EUR 935 million
has been mobilized. On average, each euro contributed by the AWF has
attracted EUR 30 more in additional follow-up investment from donors and
co-financiers, including the Bank. Since inception, a total of 90 projects
have been approved, worth EUR 106 million, with 15 projects approved in
2013. Owing to water’s close link to climate change and green growth, a
large share of the AWF’s portfolio also addresses climate adaptation and
mitigation issues, and is well aligned with the Bank’s TYS. Significantly, the
A\WF Water Fund has received EUR 156 million in contributions from three
African countries (Algeria, Burkina Faso and Senegal), nine non-Regional
Member States (Canada, UK, Sweden, France, Spain, Norway, Australia,
Denmark and Austria), the European Union, the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, as well as the Bank.

The Multi-Donor Water Partnership Program (MDWPP). The MDWPP
is the core facility for developing the Bank’s and the RMCs’ capacity in
integrated water resources management as well as in promoting learning
and innovation across a range of water sector issues. In 2013, the facility
supported the following activities: () a study of the Bank's role in achieving
regional integration through trans-boundary water basins development and
management; (ii) support for regional dialogue on water security issues;
and (iii) support for the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control
in the Sahel to operationalize a coalition for water in that region. The new
strategy to guide the implementation of the next phase of the program
(2013-2015) is under preparation.

Regional economic integration. |n 2013, total approvals for
multinational operations, made up of loans and grants, special
funds, and private equity participation, amounted to UA 1.32
billion, compared to UA 956.2 million in 2012, representing an
increase of 37.8 percent. The largest share went to infrastructure
(51.8 percent) particularly transport and energy supply, followed
by the finance sector (40.5 percent), notably for lines of credits,
trade finance, and equity financing. Smaller shares (7.7 percent)
went to agriculture social and environment sectors (Figure 4.10).

The Bank has also participated actively in seeking solutions
to the socio-economic challenges of the Sahel region, the
Horn of Africa, and the Mano River region, among others.
Problems in these areas often require a broader international
effort so the Bank has sought active partnerships with others.
In November 2018, the President of the Bank and a number
of dignitaries, including the United Nations Secretary-General,
the chairperson of the African Union Commission, the World
Bank President, and President of the European Commission,
visited the Sahel region to discuss a common vision for its
security, stability and economic development. Emphasis
was placed on challenges in agriculture, food security, water,
regional integration and infrastructure. For its part, the Bank
has initiated programs in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and the
Mano River region in response to their challenges (Box 4.4).

Private sector operations. |n 2013, the Bank committed UA
1.05 billion to finance 37 new private sector operations, an
increase of 39.4 percent over the UA 753 million approvals in
2012. Finance attracted 65.5 percent of operations, mainly in
the form of guarantees, lines of credit and equity participation
(Figure 4.11). The Bank also provided trade finance for two
multinational operations, Ecobank Transnational (UA 64.9 million)
and Shelter Afrique Habitat and Housing (UA 13.0 million), and

Annual Report 2013Box 4.4
Initiatives in the Sahel, the Horn and Mano River

The Sahel Program. The Bank is developing the Response to the Food Crisis
in the Sahel Program covering 13 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Céte
d'lvoire, Cabo Verde, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Niger,
Senegal, and Togo. The program includes interventions aimed at restoring the
resilience of households against natural disasters and chronic food insecurity,
building rural infrastructure, gender mainstreaming, climate change adaptation
and promoting disaster-risk reduction measures. The program involves collaboration with national and regional stakeholders over two five-year phases.

The Horn of Africa Initiative. This multi-phase program covers the eight
most vulnerable countries in the Horn of Africa: Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda. It is the first phase of the
broader Drought Resilience and Sustainable Livelihoods Program worth USD
125 million approved in 2012. The first phase involved improving modalities
for managing natural resources, enhancing the livestock market infrastructure
and animal health systems, improving livelihoods for agro-pastoralists, gender
mainstreaming, and boosting regional cooperation for the management of
trans-boundary natural resources. These initiatives have received broad
support, including during the Brussels Conference on Somalia in 2013.

The Mano River Forest Ecosystems Conservation Program (MARFOP).
The overall objective of this program is the sustainable management of the
Upper Guinea forest ecosystems for global ecological balance, including
carbon sequestration, climate change mitigation, gender mainstreaming
and improved livelihoods of local communities. The targeted transboundary
forest sites cover about two million hectares in the four beneficiary countries
(Cote d'\voire, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone) and provide a wide variety
of public goods and services, including serving as water catchments for
major river systems; as a habitat for wildlife; for carbon sequestration,
and improved amenities.

one national project, UT Bank in Ghana (UA 13.3 million). Energy
accounted for 22.9 percent, comprising mostly renewable
energies, such as the Lake Turkana Wind Power in Kenya (UA
98.3 million). Agriculture also saw a number of private sector
operations in 2013 (11.3 percent), including projects to boost
fertilizer production in Africa such as the Indorama Fertilizer Plant
(UA 65.1 million), and value addition, such as the Olam Group
Africa Program (UA 53.5 million). Emphasis on the creation of
linkages to local SMEs to promote their growth and expansion
is an important feature of the Bank’s private sector lending.

Figure 4.12 indicates that regional projects received the highest
share (53.6 percent) of private sector resources, with 25.7 percent
allocated to Low-Income Countries, including conflict-affected
states such as Céte d'Ivoire and Niger. Moreover, the Bank
provided letters of credit to African banks and development
finance institutions, and engaged in equity participation in regional
funds, with a sizeable number operating in Mauritius and other
Middle-Income Countries, for on-lending for projects in ADF-only
countries. Through these measures the Bank has minimized its
risk exposure, while supporting projects in Low-Income Countries.

Innovative financing instruments. During the year, the Bank
created two new innovative financing instruments, the ADF
Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) instrument and the Private
Sector Credit Enhancement Facility (PSF), to leverage the
Bank's capital and enhance non-sovereign lending in ADFeligible countries. The two instruments were considered by the
ADF Board in July 2013, and endorsed by Deputies during the
ADF-13 replenishment consultations in September 2013. The
PCG, when approved, will cover a portion of the scheduled
repayments of private loans or bonds against all risks in the
ADF-eligible RMCs. A related instrument, the Partial Risk
Guarantee (PRG), which is already operational, covers private

A\rica50O Infrastructure Fund

In 2012, African Heads of State called for innovative solutions to accelerate
infrastructure delivery in Africa, hence the continent-wide Program for
Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA). The Bank, in response, has
embarked on the creation of Africa50 as a vehicle for mobilizing private
financing for infrastructure development in Africa. Africa50 will focus on
high-impact national and regional projects in the energy, transport, ICT and
water sectors. It is structured as a development-oriented yet commerciallyoperated entity. It will be complementary to, but legally independent of
the Bank and other existing development finance institutions in Africa.

It is estimated that Africa50 will need an equity investment of USD 10
billion to be in a position to leverage USD 100 billion worth of resources
from local and international investors, including development finance
institutions, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and governments.
AfricaS0 will target an investment grade rating of single A and will
establish two business segments, one for project development, and the
other for project finance. The program aims to cut the period between
project conception and financial close from seven to three years, radically
changing the infrastructure delivery process in Africa.

 

Together with the Made in Africa Foundation, the Bank introduced Africa50
to the international financial community at a promotional event at the
NASDAQ Stock Exchange in New York in September 2013.

lenders against the risk of a government or a publicly-owned
agency failing to meet its obligations vis-a-vis a private project.

The Bank has used the Partial Risk Guarantee Program to
support two key private sector operations in 2013: (i) the Lake
Turkana Wind Power (transmission line) project in Kenya, and
(ii) the privatization of the power sector in Nigeria. In Kenya,
the PRG will provide partial risk mitigation to Lake Turkana
Wind Power Limited and the providers of debt financing to
the project for risks associated with construction delays. The
objective of the Turkana Wind Power Project is to provide
clean, reliable, and low-cost power. It will strengthen Kenya’s
national grid by increasing its capacity by about 17 percent. In
Nigeria, the goal is to catalyse private sector investment and
commercial financing to the country’s power sector through
the provision of partial risk guarantees to private investors. It
is estimated that the independent power producers eligible for
coverage under the program could help generate an additional
1,380 MW of power by 2016. The program is projected to
increase access to more reliable and affordable electricity
from 41 percent to 50 percent by 2016.

The Board of Governors endorsed the creation of Africa50, as
a stand-alone agency for infrastructure development in Africa

Box 4.6
A\rican Legal Support Facility Activities in 2013

2013 was transformative for the ALSF. It saw increased demand for
its services by RMCs, which has necessitated re-defining its priorities,
while strengthening its delivery methods. In 2013, ALSF launched its
Medium-Term Strategy for 2013 to 2017. It will enable it to respond
effectively to the growing requests for assistance and to ensure effective
delivery. The outlook for the years ahead is promising, and the Facility
will continue to build on its good record to strengthen its institutional
capacity, operational responsiveness, and enhance its role in the promotion
of Africa’s development.

The work of the ALSF was acknowledged by leaders at the G8 meeting
held in the UK in June 2013, who encouraged the international community
to support the Facility. At the completion of the ADF-13 replenishment in
late 2013, the Facility was granted access to ADF resources for its work
in Fragile States during 2014-2016.

ALSF’s projects include creditor litigation services, particularly relating to
vulture funds, advisory services in contract negotiations, such as on largescale infrastructures (particularly transport and energy), agriculture and
extractive industries (including mining, coal, oil and gas), sovereign debt
management and restructuring, operations of sovereign asset recovery,
and capacity building activities. The Facility has 56 members, including
50 states and six international organizations. In 2013, it registered 48
new requests for assistance, from which 17 were approved. This raised
the overall portfolio to 32 diverse projects, targeting 23 countries drawn
from all regions of Africa.

(Box 4.5), although its operational modalities are still under
preparation. The Bank sees Africa50 as its contribution to
the continent-wide vision, Africa 2068, on which the African
Heads of State have deliberated. An equally important driver
of the concept is the continent-wide Program for Infrastructure
Development in Africa (PIDA).

Africa’s expanding and profitable extractive industry is changing
the nature of many African economies and has attracted interest
from investors from around the world. To help deal with the
contractual and legal complexities that have accompanied
Africa’s natural resource boom and associated financial flows,
the ADB Board of Directors endorsed the establishment of
the African Legal Support Facility (ALSF) in 2008 and agreed
to provide UA 10 million for its activities over a three-year
period. The ALSF started operations in March 2010 (Box 4.6).

Supporting economic and governance reforms. |n 2013, the
Bank Group approved 54 projects and programs in support of
good governance across 30 countries with total approvals of
UA 465.7 million. This was done through Policy Based Lending

Annual Report 2013Operations (PBOs), Institutional Support Programs (ISPs), and
non-lending activities, including analytical work and advisory
services. During the year, support focused on strengthening
policies and institutions towards increased effectiveness,
transparency and accountability in the management of public
finances, and improving the business and investment climate for
private-sector led growth. The operations supported governance
reforms and improvements in the business environment. Examples
include a transport sector and economic governance program
in Nigeria (UA 193.9 million) which will increase transparency
and accountability of public expenditure management and
improve governance more generally. Support for governance
and economic competitiveness in Tanzania (UA 38.4 million)
will help improve access to electricity with positive impact on
household welfare, and the business environment. A similar
project in Senegal (UA 25.5 million) will support the creation
of an enabling environment for private sector development. In
Zimbabwe, the Bank supported a governance and institutional
reform project (UA 5.2 million) targeted at youth participation
in tourism. It will also finance the drawing up of Zimbabwe's
transport master plan. This demonstrates the Bank’s commitment
to stay engaged in Zimbabwe as the country emerges from
economic disruption and slow growth.

Promoting skills and human development. During the
year, Bank Group approvals for the social sector and human
development operations totalled UA 337.9 million, including
special funds (UA 3.1 million). Two projects were approved for
Morocco with a focus on matching training for employment,
and another to enhance medical insurance coverage in the
country. Two other projects were also supported in Rwanda
and Senegal with emphasis on skills development for increased
employability, entrepreneurship, and the promotion of women
and youth. Some salient features of the Rwanda project are
described in Box 4.7. Youth employment was one of the main
areas of focus for the Bank Group’s human development
activities during 2013. Moreover, Bank staff members were

Box 4.7
Rwanda: Skills, Employability and Entrepreneurship

The program focuses on skills and employability as well as entrepreneurship
development for accelerated growth and poverty reduction. It reinforces
reforms that address critical skills gaps, identifies relevant education
and skills development modalities for the job market, and creates an
environment that supports entrepreneurship. Expected outputs include
(i) increased private sector participation in education reform, (ii) incentives
for the acquisition of skills that are on demand; (iii) mechanisms to monitor
the relevance of training for the labour market; (iv) innovative funding and
information to support entrepreneurship; and (v) improved coordination of
entrepreneurship development programs.

Bank Group Operations Chapter 4

trained during two workshops conducted by the International
Training Centre of the International Labour Office (ILO) on
mainstreaming youth employment into Bank operations. The
training focused not only on understanding the challenge
of youth employment, but also on policy options, areas for
technical intervention and best practices.

Besides the five operational priorities of the Ten-Year Strategy,
the Strategy also focuses on three areas of special emphasis,
namely, support for agriculture and food security; gender
mainstreaming; and fragile states. Operational activities in
these areas during 2013 are reviewed below.

Agriculture and Food Security. Total project approvals for
agriculture and food security amounted to UA 530.5 million,
including special funds (UA 101.9 million). The projects
included rehabilitation of infrastructure for crop, fisheries and
livestock production, construction of access and feeder roads,
biodiversity conservation, strengthening climate resilience,
and sustainable forest management and conservation. The
approvals also included two emergency relief operations in
Benin and Madagascar. The Agricultural Transformation Agenda
Support Program for Nigeria (Box 4.8) is a good example of
the interventions undertaken by the Bank in this area.

Box 4.8
Nigeria: Agricultural Transformation Agenda
Support Program

This program, financed by a loan and a grant from the ADF worth UA
99.1 million, was approved in November 2013. It is a programmatic
and multi-sectoral operation that is adopting a commodity value-chain
approach to agricultural production and marketing in Adani-Omor, BidaBadeggi, Kano-Jigawa and Kebbi-Sokoto. The program will focus on rice,
cassava and sorghum. Its objective is to increase the income of farmers
and rural entrepreneurs engaged in the production, processing, storage
and marketing of these crops, on a sustainable basis.

On completion, the program will have rehabilitated water conveyance in
irrigation canals, feeder roads, units of hydraulic structures, community
markets, primary schools and community health centres. It also plans to
provide potable water and sanitation systems to communities and to establish
technology demonstration centres. To ensure sustainability, it will build the
capacity of public, private and community-based institutions and actors in
the agricultural value chain. Beneficiaries will be taught how to avoid postharvest losses, and to acquire skills in food processing, entrepreneurship,
and competences in combating animal and human diseases.

Atotal of 45,300 farmers and rural entrepreneurs participating in commercial
agricultural value chains will benefit directly. The program is expected to
create 120,000 jobs. Seventy percent will be women already linked to the
value chains of rice, cassava and sorghum. The domestic food supply will
gain an additional 20 million metric tonnes of these key food items each year.

45Chapter 4 Bank Group Operations

 

The Bank provided assistance to RMCs to prepare funding
proposals for the Global Agriculture and Food Security
Program (GAFSP). Of the 16 RMCs that selected the Bank as
supervising entity, seven—Niger, Liberia, The Gambia, Malawi,
Senegal, Mali and Zambia—obtained GAFSP grants worth
USD 255.4 million. The projects will strengthen livelihoods for
vulnerable groups by improving food and nutrition security and
increasing rural incomes through enhanced market access.

Putting Gender at the Center of Bank operations. The
year 2013 saw the Bank Group moving forward on its goal
to put gender concerns at the center of its operations. In
2013, the draft Gender Strategy was finalized and Board
approval is expected in the first quarter of 2014. The strategy
emphasizes gender mainstreaming in all Bank operations,
Country Strategy Papers (CSPs) and Regional Integration
Strategy Papers (RISPs). The Strategy envisages that Regional
Resource Centres and Field Offices will play a critical role in
policy dialogue on gender issues in the field, with emphasis on
projects which are sensitive to gender needs and perspectives.

The Gender Strategy emphasizes three main pillars—women’s
legal and property rights, women’s economic empowerment,
and knowledge management and capacity building for gender
equality. Within the framework, the internal strategy will seek

Award Winning Multisector Gender Support Project in
Cote d'Ivoire

Cote d’Ivoire’s political crisis in 2001 adversely affected the humanitarian
situation there, with gender-based violence harming women’s livelihoods,
and in particular sexual violence used as a weapon of war. In the absence
of supportive institutions, including access to legal redress and services,
women and girl children were seriously disempowered.

This multisector gender support project is a good example of the Bank’s
work in Fragile States. The project was approved by the Board in December
2007 and completed in December 2012. It received an award from the
US Treasury in 2013 for the promotion of gender equality. The project
focuses on the provision of services to victims of gender-based violence
in Cote d'Ivoire, empowering them and making a difference to their lives.
The component targeted to these victims benefitted some 3,500 women
directly, and indirectly, thousands more. The project has since embarked
on a more holistic provision of support through a number of schemes.
The service centres offer an integrated package of medical, psychosocial,
economic, legal and judiciary services for survivors of gender-based
violence. Moreover, women are encouraged to join income-generating
projects. This helps empower them economically and reduces their social
isolation and stigma.

Annual Report 2013to increase the Bank’s credibility, authority, and reputation as a
gender responsive and supportive institution, while the external
strategy will focus on the reduction of gender inequalities in
Africa, through Bank operations and programs. In addition, in
implementing the strategy the Bank will consult closely with
gender experts to provide capacity on the basis of need, while
also drawing on the skills of socio-economists and operations’
specialists among staff to support the integration of gender
work in the Bank’s operations.

As part of the organizational fine-tuning, a Special Envoy on
Gender was appointed to provide strategic leadership and
oversight for the implementation of the Bank’s agenda on
gender as set out in the Strategy. Country Strategy Papers will
be used as a portal for enhancing gender awareness in Bank
operations. Recent CSP missions to Liberia, Sierra Leone,
Mauritius, DRC, Céte d’lvoire and Kenya have had gender
experts on their teams. A multisector gender support project
in Céte d'Ivoire was set up with Bank support to address
the issues related to social and economic re-integration of
conflict-affected populations, promotion of awareness and
establishment of institutions to deal effectively with genderbased violence, and which empower women through incomegenerating activities (Box 4.9).

Bank’s work in Fragile States. In 2012, the Bank set up a HighLevel Panel on Fragile States, led by the President of Liberia, to
guide its thinking on its work on Fragile States. The report of
the Panel (Box 4.10) was presented at the AU Heads of State
and Government Summit in Addis Ababa in January 2014. The
critical role of the Bank in Africa’s Fragile States was emphasized

at the ADF-13 replenishment consultations during 2013. It was
acknowledged that they present some of the most intractable
problems in development. During the fine-tuning exercise in 2013,
the Fragile States Unit was upgraded to a department with an

increased staffing level. During the year, resources from the Fragile

States Facility (FSF) were allocated to 12 eligible countries. In

addition, 10 operations worth UA 124.77 million were approved

in seven countries. These were: a project for the maintenance of
the watershed and improvement of climate resilience in Burundi;
a road transport and energy project in Liberia which is part of
the Céte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea multinational

electricity networks interconnection project; rural water supply
and sanitation projects in Sierra Leone; and an energy sector
project in the Comoros. Furthermore, there were two projects in

the Democratic Republic of Congo: the Inga site development
and electricity access support project, and the project for the

reinforcement of socio-economic infrastructure in the central

region of the country. In Sudan, there was the public financial

and macro-economic management capacity-building project.
In South Sudan, two projects were approved: a water supply
and sanitation feasibility study, and technical assistance for the

development of the transport sector.

Report of the High Level Panel on Fragile States

In October 2012, the Bank established the High Level Panel (HLP) on
Fragile States led by the President of Liberia. The Report of the Panel
was completed in 2013, and presented at the AU Summit on 30 January
2014. The Report's main recommendations are as follows:

© Develop new strategies for promoting youth employment, including
supporting the demobilization, disarmament and reintegration (DDR)
of young combatants, and promoting youth entrepreneurship through
finance and training programs;

© Develop new instruments for supporting private investment in fragile
contexts by blending concessional funds with the Bank's private sector
window to support strategic investments with a wider social return;

© Support women’s empowerment through the participation of women in
peace-building and state-building processes at all levels, and provide
targeted finance and training to help women transform their microbusinesses into cooperatives and small firms;

In partnership with other agencies, contribute to the provision of the
economic aspects of security and justice by funding infrastructure for
police and other civil agencies;

© Promote resilience through regionalism by helping build the capacity of
RECs to address drivers of fragility in trans-boundary water resources
and the extractive industries;

© Review rules and procedures of the Bank so as to enable significant
improvements in the speed and flexibility of its response to countries
emerging from conflict, and also develop new, more flexible forms of
capacity-building assistance in transition contexts; and

Invest more effort into building partnerships with other institutions on
issues of conflict and fragility, both at the policy level with the African
Union, the UN system, regional institutions and civil society, and at the
country level.

n anticipation of the qualification of Somalia, Sudan and
Zimbabwe for arrears clearance, UA 362.29 million from the
ADF-12 had been set aside, in FSF Pillar II, which is dedicated
‘0 that purpose. Because the countries did not meet the criteria,
hese FSF Pillar ll resources were not utilized in 2018, the final
year of the ADF-12 cycle. During the ADF-13 replenishment
consultations last year, the ADF Deputies agreed to roll over
hese resources to be used for arrears clearance during the
ADF-13 cycle (2014-2016), assuming that the three countries
will be in a position to satisfy the required conditions. During
he year, the FSF also provided targeted support (FSF Pillar
Il) for technical assistance and institutional capacity-building
assistance to eligible fragile states and regional organizations.

The regional organizations included those from the Mano

River Union, the International Conference of the Great Lakes
Region, and the Indian Ocean Commission.

The year saw the launch of the Ten-Year Strategy for 2013 to 2022 followed by the fine-tuning of
the institutional structure to ensure that its goals would be achieved. This chapter reviews these
institutional reforms and the policies and sector strategies introduced alongside the strategy. It
also looks at the Bank’s development effectiveness and quality assurance, and activities of the
independent operations evaluation function. The ADF-13 replenishment, a key event during the
year, is also examined, especially the commitments made by the Bank and their implications
for operations. The deployment of human resources is presented alongside the activities of the
Bank’s agencies for internal control, integrity and compliance. The chapter also examines the
issue of the Bank’s return to its Headquarters in Abidjan.

5.1 Institutional Reforms

The Bank undertook a fine-tuning exercise to align the institutional
structure with the needs of the Ten-Year Strategy. It also
developed a People Strategy to guide its human resource
management between 2013 and 2017 with the goal of
positioning the Bank as the most desirable workplace for
professionals in Africa. Decentralization remained high on
the agenda, with further refinements made to the Bank’s
representation in its field and country offices across the continent.

Fine-tuning the organizational structure. |n September
2013, the Bank’s organizational structure was changed with
the following objectives to:

¢ Effectively address the emerging needs and priorities as a
result of the new Ten-Year Strategy;

Facilitate the speed of decision making and control at the
higher executive level;

e Attain best practice in risk management to maintain the
Bank's AAA credit rating;

¢ Achieve effective and efficient handling of required adjustments
as a result of the implementation of the decentralization
program;

e Enhance performance management and monitoring; and

¢ Meet the targets and commitments made under both the
GCI-VI and ADF-13 replenishment.

Among the key changes was the creation of a new position
of Group Chief Risk Officer in line with best practices on risk
governance in the corporate world and in other multilateral
development banks (MDBs). The Officer will have responsibility
for ensuring compliance with risk-related issues with respect
to credit, operational matters, the market, reputational issues,
safeguards, internal controls, and business continuity. This

50

Officer reports directly to the President, and exercises this
function independently from the risk-taking departments. The
Bank created the African Natural Resources Centre (ANRC)
to enable it to scale up work in natural resource management,
in light of the importance of oil, gas and other minerals in
Africa’s emerging economy. The ANRC will work closely with
the African Legal Support Facility (ALSF) in providing support
to countries.

The Bank also created departments dedicated to business
and financial development to guide the initiation and growth
of its business within a rapidly-changing African landscape.
They will have an important part to play in the development of
Africa50, described earlier, and the growth of Africa’s financial
sector. Departments were also created in the Secretary
General’s Complex, while a Delivery and Performance Office
was established to manage the “Executive Dashboard” and
provide early warning on areas of slippage.

Additionally, the Bank upgraded the Fragile States Unit to a
Department as noted above, to strengthen internal capacity
in dealing with issues related to conflict-affected countries.
The Nigerian Field Office was upgraded to a Office headed
by a Director, to allow for more effective engagement with
that country. The Bank also upgraded the External Relations
and Communication Unit to a Department. Similarly a Staff
Integrity and Ethics Department was created. A number of
mergers and movements of staff were also made.

Decentralization. |n 2013, the Bank Group increased its
presence in Regional Member Countries (RMCs) from 34 to 37
countries, although the number of Field Offices (FOs) remained
unchanged at 31. The Bank now has a field presence in
Benin, Guinea (Conakry), and Mauritania, without establishing
Field Offices. The staff are embedded in other agencies. The

Bank has similarly reinforced its presence in Guinea-Bissau,
Mauritius and Sao Tomé & Principe. Of particular emphasis
has been the need to enhance support to RMCs in fragile
situations. Examples include designating staff for Comoros,
Guinea-Bissau, and Somalia at Bank offices in neighbouring
countries.

During 2013, the share of professional staff based in the field
increased to 38 percent compared to 36 percent in 2012.
Overall, the increase in the number of field-based staff, coupled
with the delegation of authority, led to improvements in the
management of country portfolios. The number of projects
managed from Field Offices is now close to 50 percent,
compared to 44 percent in 2012. Similarly, the number of
project supervisions led by Field Offices rose to 42 percent
in 2013 from 32 percent in 2012.

In November 2013, the Bank initiated a mid-term review of
the Decentralization Roadmap to assess its implementation
and how much has been accomplished. In particular, it will
assess the impact on: (i) portfolio management, (ii) capacity
for field-based analytical work, and (iii) Bank participation
in policy dialogue, donor coordination and harmonization.
Finally, it will provide a perspective on the way forward and
the lessons learnt.

Return to the Headquarters. The Board of Directors approved

the budget for the “Return to Abidjan” exercise. The Board of
Governors approved the Roadmap at the Annual Meetings

Annual Report 2013

Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management Chapter 5

in May 2013. The Roadmap has five key triggers: security,
housing, office infrastructure, education, and health facilities.
A Director for the Department overseeing the return to Abidjan
(DIRA) was appointed and a monitoring and advisory committee
(COSRA) was established and mandated to take any measures
necessary to keep the process on course. The Board of
Directors is working closely with Management to oversee the
implementation of the monitoring matrix. It is expected that
a large number of staff will relocate to Abidjan during 2014.

Budget management. During 2013, the Bank continued to
implement phase 3 of the budget reforms approved by the
Board in 2007. The purpose of the reforms is to improve the
budgetary planning process and to ensure that work program
agreements between Regional and Sector Departments are
respected. Key components include: (i) the Cost Accounting
System; (ii) the Activity Time Recording System; and (iii) Country
Budget Management. The budget reforms implemented so far
have continued to provide managers with the required flexibility
of reallocating resources to priority areas, while focusing on
results. Moreover, by following up systematically on the extent
to which key performance indicator targets (KPIs), for a range
of units, are met, the budget function is now in a good position
to link budgets to deliverables.

Information technology. The Bank has been implementing
its Information Technology Strategy (ITS) 2013-2016 since
the beginning of 2013. The Strategy has six programs in
support of the Bank’s business strategy, including its return
to its Headquarters in Abidjan.

The implementation of the IT Strategy is on track. Notable
progress includes the completion of the Bank’s backbone
connecting Abidjan, Tunis, Pretoria and Nairobi, and the
upgrading of the SAP production environment in the first
quarter of 2013 under the Project Africa 2.0. Achievements
in 2013 include the following:

¢ The Bank’s information technology department, CIMM, has
been revitalized, with capabilities to plan, build and run IT
services efficiently to meet its business needs.

¢ By providing high-speed connection to the data centres
in Tunis and Pretoria, the Bank’s backbone allows it to
duplicate its data for a better Business Continuity Plan.

¢ The introduction of modern communication IT infrastructure
has changed the way business is conducted in the Bank.
Staff, member countries and business partners can now
access each other anywhere and at anytime as long as an
Internet connection is available to them.

* Connectivity to systems and between staff, for sharing
documents and collaborating on the Bank’s business, has
significantly improved, bringing efficiency and effectiveness
to the Bank operations.

5]Chapter 5 Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management

¢ The SAP technical upgrade has provided an up-to-date
environment to run the Bank's core business processes. This
step provides the platform from which functional process
improvements can be launched and deployed across the Bank.

Business continuity management. In light of the challenges
faced at its Temporary Relocation Agency (TRA) in Tunis and
its HQ in Abidjan, the Management of Business Continuity
is a key consideration for the Bank. Despite the occasional
disturbances at the TRA and in the field, the Bank continued
to meet all its important obligations vis-a-vis its stakeholders.
Notable achievements included: (1) relocation, evacuation and/
or transfers of international staff and family members from
the Central African Republic and Mali Field Offices following
adverse political events there to safer locations, (2) voluntary
relocation of TRA staff family members following events in
Tunis, and (3) creation of a Business Continuity site in South
Africa that is completely outfitted and has been ready for
use since April 2013. The Bank’s Business Continuity Plan
(BCP) preparedness has played a key role in the evaluation
exercises of the rating agencies. They are assured of the
Bank's capacity to ensure business continuity in the face of
any disruptions in its business environment.

5.2 Policies and Strategies

The Boards of Directors approved a number of policies, strategies
and guidelines during 2013 to guide Bank Group operations
in response to the rapidly-changing global environment and
circumstances and the needs of the Bank’s clients. The new
policies, strategies and guidelines will help operationalize the
Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy for 2013 to 2022.

Guidelines on the Cancellation of Eligible Non-Sovereign
Operations (approved in January 2013). The purpose of these
Guidelines is to improve the non-sovereign operations (NSOs)
cancellation process and its governance framework with a view
to enhancing utilization of Bank resources. More specifically,
they are aimed at setting out suitable criteria and procedures
for cancellation of loans, lines of credit, agency lines, equity
investments and guarantees. All mandate letters and transaction
documents of all new NSOs fall under these new Guidelines,
as regards cancellation issues. The new Guidelines have also
cleared the way for improved facilitation and coordination on
cancellation issues within the Bank itself as well as between
the Bank, co-financiers and their private counterparties. As
at end of December 2013, one equity investment project (UA
16.5 million) and one FAPA technical assistance grant (UA 0.7
million) had been cancelled, in line with the new Guidelines, as
the operations had not been signed for more than 365 days.

Private Sector Development Policy (approved in May 2013).
The Policy benefitted from the findings of the independent

52

evaluation of the Bank Group’s Non-Sovereign-Guaranteed
Operations for the period 2006-2011. The goal of the new
policy is to enhance the private sector’s contribution to
strong and inclusive economic growth in Africa that leads to
economic transformation.

Independent Evaluation Strategy, 2013-2017 (approved in
June 2013). The Independent Evaluation Strategy provides a
roadmap for realizing the three evaluation policy objectives
of accountability, learning, and promotion of an evaluation
culture with the ultimate goal of enhancing the Bank’s
development effectiveness. The strategy proposes a shift
in product mix geared towards more country and regional
strategy evaluations, corporate evaluations and sector and
thematic evaluations. It also advocates a shift from standalone project performance evaluations to cluster evaluations
of projects. The strategy clarifies the Bank’s enhanced role
in supporting the development of an evaluation culture
across the Bank and in Regional Member Countries. The
first of its kind among MDBs, the strategy forges the links
needed between long-term policy goals, evaluation activities,
evaluation skills, and resource requirements. The strategy aims
to ensure that the independent evaluation function remains
relevant and responsive to its internal and external drivers
of change, as well as to the Bank and to its clients, and that
it balances its core objectives. The strategy addresses the
important issues of ensuring impact, quality, credibility and
timeliness of evaluations.

Private Sector Development Strategy (approved in July
2013). Its thrust is threefold. First, it aims to improve Africa’s
investment and business climate by supporting the efforts of
countries to strengthen the legal and regulatory environment in
relation to business, nationally and regionally. Second, it aims
at the expansion of business access to social and economic
infrastructure, both hard—transport, telecommunications,
water, power systems, and fixed assets needed to provide
education, health and sanitation, and soft—legal and regulatory
frameworks, payments clearance and settlement systems,
financial intermediaries and capital markets, collateral registries,
credit rating agencies, and skills development. Third, it
aims at the promotion of enterprise development through
improved access to finance, skills enhancement and value
addition. Closely aligned to the Ten-Year Strategy, further
goals include supporting Fragile States with emphasis on
achieving quick and tangible results. Moreover, it aims to
put emphasis on support to women as well as to agriculture
and rural development.

Amendment to the Bank’s Credit Policy. This amendment
has already been discussed by the Senior Management
Coordination Committee (SMCC), but not yet approved.
The Policy, initially adopted in 1998, is being considered for

Annual Report 2013amendment to enable eligible ADF countries, on a case-bycase basis and under well-stipulated conditions, to have greater
access to ADB sovereign window financing. This would enable
the Bank to respond to the high demand for non-concessional
borrowing from ADF countries, but without compromising the
financial stability of the Bank. When approved, the new credit
policy will help diversify the Bank’s client base and mitigate
concentration risk.

5.3 Development Effectiveness and
Quality Assurance

During 2013, further progress was made by the Bank Group
in its efforts to enhance the quality of operations, establish
quality social and environmental safeguards, and strengthen
its ability to measure and manage for development results.

The Annual Development Effectiveness Review (ADER)
2013 explored the theme of Africa’s transition towards a
sustainable growth path and the Bank Group’s contribution
to that process. The Report argues that Africa’s growth
trajectory is closely tied to the sustainable management
of its natural resources. It notes that strong economic
growth has reduced income poverty, with the share of
the population living below the poverty line falling from
51 percent in 2005 to 39 percent in 2012. The Bank
recognizes that a major challenge today is how to address
rising inequality and exclusion. The Report concludes that
through its investments in infrastructure, agriculture and
support for regional integration, the Bank has been able
to deliver tangible development results for Africa.

Enhancing the quality of operations. |n January 2013, the
Bank introduced an evidence-based and results-focused
method for assessing project performance by making the
new Implementation Progress and Results Report (IPRR)
and the revised Project Completion Report (PCR) mandatory
aspects of reporting. Compliance with the new systems
and the quality of IPRRs and PCRs are monitored through
quarterly progress reports. The Bank now has an integrated
and comprehensive rating system that captures information
on all public sector operations through the various phases of
the project cycle: operational performance can be tracked
at entry through the readiness review (RR) method, during
implementation through the IPRR rating and at completion

Annual Report 2013

Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management Chapter 5

through the PCR rating. As of end December 2013, about
66 percent of eligible public sector operations complied
with the new rating method. The Bank’s quality-at-entry
standards developed in 2010 were updated. The new set of
criteria used in the readiness review became effective from
January 1, 2014.

Ensuring social and environmental safeguards. The Bank
and its Regional Member Countries have put considerable
emphasis on sustainable development, notably the protection
of the environment and livelihoods during the development
process. Safeguards are a powerful tool for identifying risks,
reducing development costs, and improving project sustainability,
with direct benefits to communities and helping to preserve
the environment. In December 2013, the Boards adopted
the Integrated Safeguards System (ISS)—the cornerstone
of the Bank’s strategy to promote growth that is socially
inclusive and environmentally sustainable. It was developed
after extensive consultations. Five regional workshops—in
Nairobi, Lusaka, Libreville, Abuja and Rabat—provided the
opportunity to listen, to and address concerns raised by
various stakeholders, including civil society. The ISS not only
promotes best practices in these areas, but also encourages
greater transparency and accountability. It provides a process
for the people, especially the most vulnerable communities,
to express their views, by providing, for example, project-level
grievance and redress mechanisms.

Tables 5.1 and 5.2 below use a traffic lights system to depict
scores on the progress made at four levels. For Level 1,
Africa’s relative performance is measured by comparing its
progress with that of Africa’s peer group (Low-and Middleincome countries around the world); for Level 2 the Bank’s
performance is measured by comparing expected and actual
achievements for all operations that have been completed;
for Levels 3 and 4 the Bank’s progress is measured against
its progress in achieving its 2013 targets set out in the Bank’s
Results Measurement Framework. Level 2 scores indicate
that the Bank has made good progress in its support of
Africa’s infrastructure, private sector, and skills and technology
development. It has made moderate progress in its support
of governance and accountability and regional integration. A
more detailed account is provided in Table 5.2 which presents
the contribution the Bank is making to development through
its operations in Africa.

5.4 ADF-13 Replenishment

Activities related to the 13th Replenishment of the ADF (20142016) were important in 2013. Consultations were held over
three rounds, with the final round held in Paris in September
2013. The Bank Group called on development partners to
ensure a strong replenishment that would not only help to
sustain growth and reduce poverty, but would also advance
the transformation of Africa as envisioned in the Ten-Year
Strategy. At the final meeting, participants commended the
Fund for meeting the needs of its clients during the ADF-12
period. There was general recognition that the Fund had made
a tangible impact, particularly in the areas of infrastructure,
governance, support for Fragile States, and regional integration.

Ultimately, participants reaffirmed their support for Africa’s economic
transformation and agreed to a total replenishment level of UA
5.3465 billion for the period 2014 to 2016 (Box 5.1). Given the
deep crisis in the world economy and the tough fiscal situation
faced by State participants, this was a significant achievement. It
signalled strong shareholder support for the Bank and for Africa’s
transformation agenda. Participants welcomed the fact that African
countries increased their role in the ADF, with Libya and Angola
joining South Africa and Egypt as contributors to the Fund.

56

 

Box 5.1
ADF-13 Replenishment

 

The ADF Deputies agreed on the ADF-13 replenishment level of UA 5.345
billion. When the technical gap is excluded, the total resources available for
the ADF-13 period, 2014-2016, amount to UA 4,820.935 million*. The specific amounts for the components of the replenishment level are as follows:

e Donor subscriptions = UA 3,789.330 million

e Supplementary contributions = UA 55.684 million

e Technical gap (12.04%) = UA 524.091 million

e Advance Commitment Capacity = UA 975.921 million
Total (ADF-13 replenishment level) = UA 5,345.026 million

Participants agreed that 21 percent of the ADF-13 resources would be
allocated to the Regional Operations (RO) envelope, and UA 662 million
to the Fragile States Facility (FSF). In addition, seed capital worth UA 165
million would be provided to the new Private Sector Credit Enhancement
Facility (PSF), which is one of the innovative financing instruments created
to mitigate the risks associated with lending to Low-Income Countries.

 

 

* As noted in paragraph 5.10 of the ADF-13 Report, under Burden Sharing:
“In a replenishment, the technical gap serves to (1) accommodate the
subscriptions of new State participants or donors; (2) allow increased or
additional subscriptions during the life of the replenishment, without impacting
the burden shares of all participants; and (3) offer State participants the
flexibility to increase their burden sharing during a particular replenishment
without exceeding the target replenishment level.”

Annual Report 2013Box 5.2
ADF-13 Reforms — Amended Performance-Based
Allocation (PBA) Formula

At the final meeting of the ADF-13 replenishment consultations, the Deputies
reaffirmed that the main determinants of the PBA formula will continue
to be country need and country performance. However, the PBA formula
will be adjusted with the addition of the Africa Infrastructure Development
Index (AIDI) to the formula’s current needs component to better address
the infrastructure gap on the continent. At least 91.6 percent of ADF-13
resources will be allocated based on country performance through direct
PBA (62 percent), and PBA-linked set-asides (29.6 percent)—FSF Pillar
| and Regional Operations (RO) envelopes. Additional elements of the formula include provisions that:

¢ Individual country allocations may not exceed 10 percent of all resources available.

e A minimum allocation of UA 15 million per cycle will be applied for
all countries, with the exception of countries in transition to blend or
ADB-only status.

¢ Each blend country will continue to receive 50 percent of what it would
receive had it been an ADF-only country, subject to the minimum allocation of UA 15 million for all ADF-eligible countries.

A set of reforms was agreed, including improving the system for
allocating resources to ADF-eligible Regional Member Countries
(Box 5.2); strengthening the Bank Group’s capacity to respond
to the challenges of fragility throughout the continent; and
leveraging ADF resources through two new innovative financing
instruments (the ADF Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) and the
Private Sector Credit Enhancement Facility (PSF)). Moreover,
under ADF-13, a revised results framework has also been
developed for measuring and reporting development results.

5.5 Independent Evaluation of
Bank Operations

The Operations Evaluation Department (OPEV) finalized an
Independent Evaluation Strategy that will guide its work in
the medium term. It also completed a number of project,
sector, thematic, corporate and country level evaluations and
undertook several knowledge sharing activities.

During 2018, the Board of Directors approved the Bank Group’s
Independent Evaluation Strategy, 2013-2017 (see section
5.2). This Strategy aims to promote learning, accountability,
and an evaluation culture within the Bank in support of the
overarching goal of improving development effectiveness
among the Bank’s Regional Member Countries.

Compared to previous years, the number of thematic, sector,
corporate and country strategy evaluations increased markedly,

Annual Report 2013

Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management Chapter 5

while those for stand-alone projects decreased. At the same
time, attempts were made to ensure greater synergies between
project level work and high-level evaluations by conducting
project cluster evaluations, strategically selected to feed
into on-going high level evaluations. Several independent
evaluations were completed during 2013 including:

Project Level Evaluations: Road sustainability (covering
ten road projects) and regional integration (covering four
multinational and international projects); Thematic and
Sector Evaluations: Independent Evaluation of Non-sovereign
Operations, 2006-2011, Review of the Bank’s Economic
and Sector Work, Evaluation of the Bank’s Integrated Water
Resource Management, Institutional Strengthening Projects in
Governance, Transport Sector, and Microfinance; Corporate
Evaluations: Procurement (first phase), Trust Fund Management
at the African Development Bank (2012), Additionality and
Development Outcome Assessment, and Quality at Entry of
public sector projects; Country Strategy Evaluations (CSEs),
Botswana (2013), Chad (2012), and Kenya (2013).

Reinforcing feedback from evaluations into Bank operations is
a key concern for the Bank’s independent evaluation function.
Throughout the year, OPEV actively disseminated evaluation
results to the Bank’s stakeholders, and engaged with, and
shared evaluation knowledge with them. It implemented two
ey actions aimed at strengthening the uptake of evaluation
results into the Bank’s operations: (i) designed a Management
Action Record System (MARS) which was approved by
he Board in October 2013. A software program for the
implementation of the system will soon be developed; and (ii)
inalized an Evaluation Results Database designed to facilitate
rapid recall of lessons, recommendations, findings and ratings
produced during self and independent evaluations of Bank
operations. The database contains more than 1,000 lessons
learnt, covering the period 1998-2013.

 

The following key independent evaluation activities also took

place during 2013:

¢ Development of a departmental website to facilitate access
to evaluative knowledge;

© Organization of several face-to-face events under the auspices
of the Evaluation Community of Practice, with participation
from across the Bank, to facilitate knowledge exchange;

© Organization of regional learning events to facilitate knowledge
sharing among experts and beneficiaries;

¢ Development of enhanced knowledge sharing tools and
approaches, including videos and use of social media to
meet the needs of different target audiences;

¢ Publication of four issues of eVALUAtion Matters (a quarterly
knowledge publication that presents different perspectives
on development evaluations).

SfChapter 5 Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management

Comprehensive Evaluation of the Bank. In October 2013,
the Board’s Committee on Operations and Development
Effectiveness (CODE) requested a comprehensive evaluation of
the Bank’s work. It underscored the fact that the organization’s
specific challenges, its new strategic direction, upcoming events,
and other changes as well as ongoing work would inform such
an evaluation. It selected an option with two separate products:
(1) a review of the implementation of commitments—to be
delivered in mid-2015; and (2) a comprehensive evaluation
of development results— to be delivered in 2016.

Implementation of GCI and ADF commitments. This evaluation
aims to serve both accountability and learning purposes. It
seeks to respond to GCI and ADF contributors’ request for
independent reviews of the implementation of commitments.
It will review the processes for agreeing and implementing
commitments as a whole; and will look at the Bank as a whole,
not only at issues related to one specific funding instrument.

Making a Difference in Africa - A Comprehensive Evaluation
of the Bank’s Development Results. This evaluation aims
to address key stakeholders’ need for better assessment
and reporting of development results at the Bank. While
studies have been done to address the Bank’s organizational
effectiveness and efficiency, there is a dearth of credible
and evidence-based information on development results
achieved by the Bank on the ground, particularly in terms
of final development outcomes such as real improvements
in people’s lives; how the Bank’s development results relate
and contribute to higher-level RMC goals in infrastructure,
private sector or social development; and how their impact
could be enhanced in the future, given the mandate and
resources of the Bank and a rapidly-changing environment
for development aid. This evaluation aims to provide answers
to these questions and to provide lessons for the Bank going
forward, rather than to simply record backwards.

In addition to the comprehensive evaluation, the following
evaluations are also underway: Quality at Entry; Energy Sector
and Food Security Evaluations; The Bank’s Assistance to SMEs
(2018); Private Sector Equity; and Public-Private Partnerships;
and the second phase of the Procurement Evaluation.

5.6 Procurement and Fiduciary Services

As in previous years, the Bank’s procurement functions
and fiduciary services touched on the design, preparation,
appraisal, supervision and completion of all projects and
programs financed by the Bank. Through dedicated capacity
building, countries have received direct assistance in public
financial management, including procurement, with positive
impacts on other areas of the Bank’s work, such as project
implementation and financial governance.

58

In 2013, the Bank Group continued to roll out its Delegation of
Authority Matrix (DAM), a central plank in its decentralization
efforts. But equally important was the exercise to determine
new International Competitive Bidding (ICB) thresholds through
empirical analyses of historical data. It is expected that the
Bank Group will be able to make savings in procurement
processing time of some 5.5 months per project, per year,
through this exercise. It is also now in a position to execute the
Agreement for Mutual Enforcement of Debarment Decisions
having reached agreement with other MDBs on crossdebarment. A total of 122 Bank staff received training on
procurement issues.

In the specific area of financial management, the focus has
been on creating guidelines to deal with the complexities
related to working in a decentralized environment, notably in
Field Offices, while maintaining the highest levels of fiduciary
standards. The emphasis on timely submission of project
audits has yielded results with on-time submission of these
reports rising from 29 percent in 2012 to more than 90 percent
in 2013. Along with improved timeliness, there has been a
sharp reduction in the backlog of reporting and increases in
the quality of the reports. Less than 10 percent of the reports
are now rejected on quality grounds, compared to more than
80 percent in the past.

5.7 Intermediate Recourse Mechanisms
and Administrative Tribunal

The Office of the Auditor General, the Staff Integrity and
Ethics Office, the Ombudsman’s Office, the Integrity and AntiCorruption Department, Compliance Review Mechanism and
the Administrative Tribunal played important roles in the Bank
Group as intermediate recourse mechanisms and agencies
of corporate restraint and responsibility in 2013.

Audit. During 2013, the Office of the Auditor General reviewed
a number of areas where Management’s attention was
required to bring about changes in policies and procedures.
The full automation of internal audit working papers has now
become standard practice in the Office, with all staff trained.
Likewise, the Office has carried out intensive training in treasury
auditing, SAP, data mining techniques, cloud computing and
procurement practices to raise its analytical capacity and
efficiency. Finally, closer cooperation has occurred with other
oversight mechanisms within the Bank with a view to paying
close attention to all potential risks and to the formulation of
mitigation measures. The Office has helped enhance the Bank
Group’s capacity to bring a systematic and disciplined approach
to the evaluation and improvement of risk management, and
control and governance processes. In that regard, the Office
sees its strategic objective as being an effective third line of
defence in the prudential management of the Bank Group.

Annual Report 2013Staff Integrity and Ethics. During the year, a new Staff
Integrity and Ethics Office (SIEO) was created as part of the
fine-tuning exercise. While the new Integrity Unit is housed
together with Ethics, the roles of the two are different. Ethics
Officers will continue to provide advice and counsel to staff.
Integrity staff, on the other hand, will investigate, and prosecute,
through the Bank’s internal justice system, staff who violate
rules or whose conduct falls short of prescribed standards.
The exception will be cases of corruption, which will continue
to be handled by the Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department
(IACD). The Staff Integrity and Ethics function completes
the Bank’s internal justice system, to defend staff rights as
enshrined in the Bank’s rules and regulations.

During the year, the Bank embarked on the review of the current
Code of Conduct, and launched a Bank-wide consultation
process, whereby all staff members were invited to present
suggestions for inclusion in the new Code. The Office also
seeks to inculcate an ethical culture in every sphere of Bank
business, both at Headquarters and in the Field Offices. In
this respect, the Office is continuously developing, aligning
and introducing programs aimed at reaching out to all staff
and Management across the Bank.

By the creation of the Staff Integrity and Ethics Office function,
the Bank has aligned with practices in other MDBs. It is also
amember of the Ethics and Compliance Officers Association
(ECOA), which brings together ethics practitioners from private,
public and international organizations, and that of the Ethics
Network of Multilateral Organizations (ENMO).

Ombudsman. The office of the Ombudsman handled a number
of grievances during 2013 ranging from abuse of authority to lack
of career development and job security concerns. In all, about 7
percent of staff at post, with a total of 167 cases, approached
the Ombudsman for assistance in 2013. The Office was able
to close about 63 percent of the cases brought to its attention
in about four weeks, and the total caseload closed by year-end
2013. The Office has also actively put in place measures to prevent
work-related grievances before they arise. During 2013, the Office
took part in the induction of 109 new staff and also undertook
missions to Field Offices and Regional Resource Centres to impart
information on the merits of the informal recourse mechanisms
and conflict prevention in the workplace. Also important, the
Office trained eight values promotion champions and organized
the 2013 Conflict Competency Week.

Integrity and Anti-Corruption. |n 2013, the Integrity and AntiCorruption Department sought to operationalize the Cross
Debarment Agreement which the Bank signed with other MDBs
in 2010. It introduced a two-tier sanctions regime composed
of a sanctions entity that is independent of the investigative
office. The first tier, which is the Sanctions Office, is headed

Annual Report 2013

Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management Chapter 5

by a Sanctions Commissioner who is an external expert, and
whose appointment was approved in February 2013 by the
Board of Directors. The first batch of investigation reports was
submitted to the Sanctions Commissioner in August 2013.
The Sanctions Appeals Board (SAB) is the second tier of the
sanctions process. It considers cases as they are received
(on a de novo basis). At the beginning of 2013, the number
of investigative cases brought forward from the previous year
was 49, while the number of new cases registered during the
year was 32, bringing the total number of cases in progress
0 81 for 2013.

n addition, the Bank participated in a number of seminars
and conferences organized in Regional Member Countries,
including at the Bank Group. Notably, in September the Bank
hosted the 14th Conference of International Investigators at
its TRA in Tunis. This annual meeting allowed participants
rom international organizations to discuss issues relating
‘0 the prevention of corruption and fraud and to share new
techniques and know-how. Some 155 investigators attended
he conference.

Compliance Review and Mediation. The Compliance
Review and Mediation Unit administers the Independent
Review Mechanism (IRM) focused on the handling of several
mediation and compliance review cases, training of Bank staff
and outreach to improve the visibility of the IRM. The IRM
receives and responds to complaints from people adversely
affected by Bank-financed projects.

 

In 2013, requests were received related to the Road Support
Project Il in Tanzania and the Dakar-Diaminiadio Highway
Project in Senegal, and these were brought to a satisfactory
conclusion through the intermediation of IRM. Progress was
also made in the handling of a complaint, through compliance
review, about the Medupi power project in South Africa. Several
of the issues raised by the people affected were resolved by
the South African electricity public utility, ESKOM, the project
promoter. The Boards of Directors approved a formal process
for the IRM to monitor the action plan for this project that was
jointly agreed by the parties involved.

During the year, an extensive institutional outreach program
resulted in improved awareness among Executive Directors,
Management and other Bank staff of the mandate and function
of the IRM. Bank staff has benefitted from training on mediation
and problem-solving techniques. Moreover, the Bank also
reached out to affected people, local communities, civil society
organizations, project beneficiaries, project implementation
units, governments and private sector entities.

Administrative Tribunal. The Administrative Tribunal, an
autonomous body of the Bank, performs its role as an

5DChapter 5 Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management

independent organ of last resort in matters of disputes between
staff and Management, and its decisions are binding, final
and without appeal. Over the 2012-2013 period, the Tribunal
registered three cases, one of which was withdrawn, while the
third case was carried forward to 2014. Apart from its judicial
work, the Tribunal played an active role in activities of other
Intermediate Recourse Mechanisms of the Bank in 2013 in
order to enhance their efficacy and to avoid litigation. It also
organized outreach programs in collaboration with the Staff
Appeals Committee and the Staff Council through training
and information seminars which covered seven Field Offices
and the Bank's Office in Abidjan, representing approximately
250 staff in total.

5.8 Deployment of Human Resources

The Human Resources Department, which has been at the
centre of the many changes affecting the Bank Group in the
recent past, continued to strengthen its client focus model
and significantly increased its efficiency, services provision and
support for the decentralization process. The People Strategy
and an accompanying action plan were launched in 2013. The
provision of critical training to Bank staff has become a key
ingredient of the Bank’s approach to the operationalization
of the Strategy.

People Strategy. A key engagement in 2013 was the
development and launch of the People Strategy 2013-—
2017. It was approved by the Board in May 2013, and is
well aligned with the Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy. It has four
pillars: leadership; performance and accountability; employee
engagement and communication; and developing a workforce
of the future. The action plan to operationalize the People
Strategy was also launched. Its goal is to position the Bank
as the employer of choice for those working on African
growth and development.

Subsequently, the Bank completed a staff survey in November
2013, based on the four pillars of the People Strategy. The
survey will enable the Bank to assess how well managers
are delivering on the People Strategy and also form the basis
for performance contracts. Preliminary results of the staff
survey indicate that the Bank has made steady and significant
improvement since the “fully-fledged” Staff Survey of 2007,
in areas such as (i) AfDB as a place of work; (ii) sense of
accomplishment that the job provides to staff; (iii) clarity about
expectations; and (iv) whether AfDB inspires the best output
from staff. It also indicates that the Bank’s mission continues
to be a source of pride and inspiration, and Bank staff feel
that the Institution inspires them to do their best.

Human Resource Action Plan. The Bank is preparing a Human
Resource Action Plan to set targets for what is expected in

60

terms of deliverables from the People Strategy. In terms of
targets, the Bank has achieved a 7.9 percent vacancy rate
for professional level positions, better than the target of 9
percent for end-December 2013.

In 2013, the Human Resources Business Partners scheme
was reinforced through continuous training and now provides
dedicated services to all Complexes. Efficiency in meeting
staffing needs was enhanced with a new recruitment strategy
pilot scheme. The time taken to fill a vacancy was reduced
by 23 percent. The Bank staff complement increased by 4.1
percent to 2065 at end-December 2013, including 1,387
professional staff, 27.4 percent of whom were female, and
678 general service staff (41 percent male). There were 19
Executive Directors and 39 Advisors at post. Female Managerial
staff including two Vice Presidents totalled 44 (25.6 percent
of Managerial Staff). See Table 5.3 for the details.

Staff training has been a key human resource development
activity at the Bank. The goal has been to maximize the impact
of the training budget on Bank operations and programs.
Several training packages were introduced through in-house
and on-site activities in 2013, the focus being on enhancing
staff competences, ensuring peer-to-peer learning, and transfer
of knowledge. The broader goal is to create communities of
learning at the Headquarters and in the field that will translate
these learning opportunities into an internal Bank resource for
ideas and skills development. The Knowledge and Learning
Management System has provided access to learning and
training in all areas of Bank operations, to a broad spectrum
of staff members.

 

Return to Abidjan. The decision to return to the Bank’s
Headquarters in Abidjan has been an important preoccupation
for Bank Management, and the Human Resources Department,
touching on many of its activities and those of the rest of
the Bank Group. The Bank held several town hall meetings
and familiarization exhibitions for the benefit of staff and their
families, and involving key stakeholders from Abidjan (schools,
banks, service providers, relocation agencies, real estate
agencies and logistics experts). The Bank has also provided
important feedback to staff on preparations for the return and
has undertaken reconnaissance visits to Abidjan to establish
the level of preparedness with respect to accommodation,
schools, medical facilities and the social environment. Moreover,
conscious of the emotive nature of the exercise, regular and
well-crafted communications on issues pertaining to the
return have been undertaken, particularly to inform staff on
progress, allay fears and manage staff concerns. A handbook

nN “arriving and living” in Abidjan has also been compiled.
Besides, the Bank also continued to provide support for
the decentralization agenda, particularly with regard to staff
working conditions in Fragile States.

Annual Report 2013Chapter 6 Boards’ Oversight Functions and Strategic Responsibilities

During 2013, the Bank Group’s Boards of Directors and the Boards of Governors responded
with vigour to Africa's rapidly changing economic and structural challenges and its implications for
Bank Group interventions, as reflected by their deliberations through the year. They encouraged
the Bank to be innovative and strategic and to focus on results in its operations, and to seek
new opportunities in the rapidly-changing economic environments of its Regional Member
Countries. While the 78-member Board of Governors is the Bank’s apex policy-making organ,
with a representative drawn from each of the member countries—53 Regional and 25 nonRegional—the day-to-day oversight functions are delegated to a Resident Board of Directors
(20 members in total, each generally representing a constituency of member states). The ADF’s
Board of Governors has 79 members, and its Board of Directors has 14.

6.1 Boards of Directors

The Executive Directors provided oversight and strategic
direction to the Bank Group during an eventful year for the
institution and its RMC clients. Key strategies and policies
were approved, notably the Ten-Year Strategy for 2013 to
2022. In addition, the ADF-13 replenishment was successfully
concluded. The monitoring of the budget, including its MidTerm Review, was a key preoccupation, as were discussions
on the Bank’s return to Abidjan.

The Boards of Directors discharged their functions through
seven specialized committees, including the Committee of the
Whole which oversees the budget process. They also consulted
widely with the Chair of the Boards in informal sessions, and
with Bank staff members through formal seminars chaired by
the Bank President. In 2013, the Boards oversaw the work of
the Office of the Auditor General, Integrity and Anti-Corruption,
Operations Evaluation, Compliance Review and Mediation Unit
and Administrative Tribunal to ensure corporate restraint and
responsibility. These Organizational Units work at arms-length
from the rest of the Bank. In line with these responsibilities, the
Boards exercised oversight over the following areas:

¢ Financial management, accounting, risk and internal controls,
procurement, integrity and anti-corruption activities of the
Bank Group;

© Selection, compensation, independence and performance
of the Bank Group External Auditors;

¢ Financial reporting process, including the internal control
structure and procedures for financial reporting and
monitoring the integrity and reliability of the Bank’s financial
statements;

64

¢ Ensuring the independence and efficient performance of the
Bank Group’s internal audit and the integrity and sanctions
functions;

© Guiding the evaluation function of the Bank Group; and

e Ensuring best practice in procurement of goods and
services and contracting consultants, including corporate
procurement.

The Boards of Directors also took note of the work of the
Independent Review Mechanism, which ensures that the
Bank Group complies with its own policies and procedures.
The successful conclusion of a number of cases, reported in
Chapter 5 with respect to the work of the Compliance Review
and Mediation Unit, was a fitting testament to the rigour and
transparency of the process, which has been commended
by both beneficiaries and donor countries.

Monitoring the Institution’s budget process during 2013 was
an important key oversight function. In discussing the 20142016 Rolling Plan and Budget Proposals, the Boards provided
guidance on how the Bank would achieve a higher level of
cost efficiency without undue impact on its core activities.
Board Members also provided views and advice on the finetuning of the Bank Group’s organizational structure to support
the Ten-Year Strategy. They argued that Africa’s structural
transformation required the Bank Group to further enhance
its efficiency and capacity for delivery.

More than half of the Boards of Directors completed their
terms of office in 2013 and were replaced by new members
following the general election of Executive Directors by the
Boards of Governors at the Annual Meetings in Marrakech.

Annual Report 2013Key assignments for the Executive Board in 2013. The
Boards met in January 2013 to discuss their agenda for the
year. The Chair outlined five key assignments:

* Continued implementation of the decentralization roadmap—the Bank saw considerable progress during the year,
including among others, mergers of Regional Departments,
consolidation of Resource Centres, and the creation of a
Nigeria Country Office;

¢ Approval of the Bank’s return to its Headquarters in Abidjan
by the Boards of Governors—this was duly done, with
preliminary departure dates for staff back to Abidjan set
by the end of 2013;

¢ Replenishment of the ADF, which in light of the difficult global
economic environment was expected to be quite a difficult
task—the exercise in September proved more successful
than thought earlier;

¢ Approval and implementation of the Ten-Year Strategy—
duly done in the course of the year; and

© Organization of the Annual Meetings—held successfully
during May/June in Marrakech, Morocco.

Boards of Directors Retreat in 2013. At the beginning of 2013,
the Boards of Directors held a two-day retreat in Tunis with the
theme “Inclusive Growth through Structural Transformation”.
This proved to be a prelude to addressing the matter at the
Bank's Annual Meetings in Marrakech. The subject was timely
as it highlighted Africa’s reality—at the threshold of structural
transformation, but with inequality and exclusion being still a
threat to progress. The Board members made the following
recommendations on the role that the Bank can play to support
inclusive and transformative growth in Africa:

First, dialogue with RMCs on the importance of prudent public
finance management, the provision of safety nets, upholding of
property rights and adequate access to finance was absolutely
necessary for sustainable growth and for the improvement of
general welfare. Second, it was necessary to help RMCs in
building capacities in all these areas, including through sharing
best practices. Such outreach efforts should also include local
civil society organizations, and project the importance of good
leadership, promotion of civil liberties, and inclusion of women
and the youth in economic and political life. Third, the Boards
underlined the importance of embarking on actions to speed
up regional integration. Fourth, they argued that private sector
growth required innovative financing, including lines of credit
that also reach SMEs.

Selected themes from Board discussions during 2013.
This section highlights some of the key themes and areas
of emphasis emerging from Board discussions during 2013
and provides a general view of the nature and range of Board
guidance on the various policies and programs as follows:

Annual Report 2013

(ii)

Boards’ Oversight Functions and Strategic Responsibilities Chapter 6

Assist RMCs to pursue inclusive policies and share the
benefits of Bank support with their populations. The
Board noted, for example, that the Medical Coverage
Reform Support Program for Morocco, aimed at improving
social and medical protection for vulnerable and remote
communities, was a good model for other African
countries—a basis for ensuring social cohesion. The
Board also praised the Inclusive Growth and Economic
Competitiveness Support Program for Senegal for its
focus, donor coordination and incorporation of gender
issues from the outset. The Board wondered, however,
why discussion of regional integration was not included
in a project focusing on issues of competitiveness. In
discussing the Skills, Employability and Entrepreneurship
Program for Rwanda, the Board observed the need
for a holistic approach to development to ensure that
agriculture and the rural sector are not drained of
competent workers.

ADF Replenishment. The year marked the 13th
Replenishment of ADF resources. The Boards participated actively in all the preliminary preparations and
meetings with ADF Deputies held in Tunis. The Board
commented and provided guidance on all the background
and framework papers and Board Members attended
the final pledging meeting held in Paris.

Pursue innovative financing and other new ways of doing
business —including leveraging the Bank’s AAA status. The
Bank Group established two new forms of instruments:
first, the ADF Partial Credit Guarantee and Private Sector
Enhancement Facility to leverage the Bank’s capital and
enhance non-sovereign lending in ADF eligible countries
with low and moderate risk of debt distress. Second, the
year saw the establishment of a Trade Finance Program
and Business Plan with three components — Trade Finance
Lines of Credit; Soft Commodity Finance Facilities, and
Risk Participation Agreements (Guarantee). The Board
lauded the Management's use of the partial risk guarantee
instrument to mitigate risks for private sector investors
during the privatization of the electricity sector in Nigeria
and for the evacuation of power from the Lake Turkana
Wind Power Project. It also noted that the trade finance
risk participation facilities (on an unfunded basis) extended
to CommerzBank AG and Citibank-NA to finance private
sector operations in Africa were catalytic. The line of credit
and subordinated debt to the Mauritius Commercial
Bank to finance private sector operations in the Region
was another example of the Bank Group’s leverage.
The AfricaSO project was presented to the Boards for
preliminary discussion. They appreciated the innovative
nature of this vehicle for infrastructure financing, which
aims to reduce the funding gap for Africa’s infrastructure

development, providing impetus to economic growth
and development.

Support Fragile States to boost resilience. Discussing a
programming brief for Somalia, the Board commended
Management for its strategic interventions and support
for the consolidation of peace and national unity. Board
members urged further that flexible ways to engage
the country be found, although the evolution of the
situation should be monitored carefully. The Board
requested that Management develop internal capacity
to deal effectively with similar cases among RMCs. The
proposed support to Mali was commended for seeking
to strengthen the capacities of central government as
was the agricultural infrastructure rehabilitation project
for Madagascar for its gender mainstreaming, notably
ensuring that women obtained titles for their land
holdings. A recurring question in Board discussions on
Fragile States was how to ensure a sustained flow of
resources to conflict-affected countries to help them
emerge out of fragility. The Board noted that the Energy
Sector Support Project for Comoros met this need as
it addressed inadequate power supply on the islands,
and would also allow the country to tap into its vast
renewable energy potential.

Highlight role and importance of Bank’s private
sector operations in RMCs. In discussing the Private
Sector strategy, the Board argued especially for the
importance of highlighting the Bank Group’s catalytic
role in leveraging private sector resources, and to
include the private sector in solutions for infrastructure
maintenance and agricultural development. Further,
the Board requested that governance issues and
aspects of inclusive growth and the green economy
be incorporated explicitly. More specifically, the Board
requested Management to involve small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) in all private sector projects
as it is important for job creation and the livelihoods
of the low-income earners. Also important, the Board
requested that the Private Sector Strategy be clearer
on the sector’s role in Africa’s structural transformation.
The Bank’s Africa SME Program received praise for its
emphasis on job creation, although the Board underlined
the risks inherent in complex regional programming. The
Board praised the private sector financed Indorama
Fertilizer Project in Nigeria for its potential for agricultural
transformation as well as creating dynamic linkages to
the rest of the economy. On the other hand, the Board
supported the private sector operations cancellation
guidelines—but emphasized that they should be seen
as measures of last resort and that the role of the Field
Offices in this regard be strengthened.

(vii)

(viii)

Strengthen fiscal and financial management in RMCs
to ensure value for money for Bank-supported projects.
The Board commended the Transport Sector and
Economic Governance Reform Project for Nigeria for its
promotion of inclusive growth through better transport
sector governance as well as enhancing transparency in
public finance management. It underlined the importance
of road maintenance and that of developing a transport
master plan for the country. The Bank made similar
comments on smaller projects supporting public sector
reforms in the Gambia and Malawi.

Country Strategy Papers (CSPs). Various CSPs were
presented to the Board in 2013 and the key issues
raised at Board related to how closely aligned they
were to the umbrella Ten-Year Strategy, although the
link to the Private Sector Strategy also arose frequently.
The Board saw the the Nigerian CSP for 2013-2017 as
a good test for the operationalization of the Ten-Year
Strategy, with two pillars: (i) creation of a sound policy
environment, and (ii) infrastructure development. The
Board requested more emphasis on selectivity and
gender mainstreaming. In contrast, some other CSPs
were found to have too many pillars—or pillars that in
effect covered many sectors. This threatened focus and
implementation. Likewise, the Board insisted that CSPs
should discuss more explicitly how the implementation
of Bank strategies, notably the Ten-Year Strategy, for
the country in question was envisioned. In the case of
the CSP for Sierra Leone, the Board suggested that a
deeper review of the country’s fragility be undertaken,
with a view to understanding how it could benefit from
its vast natural resources. For the Malawi CSP, the
concern was how best to address the slow pace of
macroeconomic reforms and the country’s increasing
aid dependency. The Board has also made it clear that
its involvement in the CSP should come much earlier
in the process to enable it provide guidance at an early
stage.

Scaling-up infrastructure access. The Board was
supportive of a variety of infrastructure projects brought
for consideration in 2013. However, as in the case of
the Scaling-up Energy Access Project for Rwanda, the
Board expressed concern over issues of affordability
and viability. The Board also raised environmental
concerns with respect to the Maamba Collieries Power
Generation Project in Zambia, but was subsequently
satisfied that the project was fully in line with the Bank’s
Energy Policy.

Multinational projects should have a strong element
of inclusion. Discussing the Ndende-Dolisie Road and

Annual Report 2013Libreville-Brazzaville Corridor Transport Facilitation
Project (Phase 1), the Board noted that the proposed
project was inclusive, providing access to rural areas,
while increasing trade. It also noted that for the project
to be sustainable required the free movement of
goods and people in the region. Discussing support
for roadworks in Kenya and Tanzania, the Board
underlined the importance of proper road maintenance
on both sides of the border. They noted that feeder
roads were needed to ensure that adjacent districts
also benefitted from the new road infrastructure. Similar
sentiments on inclusion were voiced with respect to
the Trans-Sahara Highway (Algeria/Niger/Chad) and
the Biodiversity program for Central Africa targeted at
elephant protection. In comments on the Pan African
University project, the Board noted with satisfaction
that considerable emphasis was placed on gender
equality.

Human resources and institutional reforms. The Boards
approved and endorsed the new People Strategy,
2013-2017, and Human Resource Action Plan, 2013—
2015, respectively, as a means to attract and retain the
best talent while remaining competitive in the labour
market. The aim of the strategy is to position the Bank

Boards’ Oversight Functions and Strategic Responsibilities Chapter 6

as the employer of choice for professionals working
on African growth and development. In comments, the
Board emphasized the importance of strengthening
linkages between the People Strategy and the TenYear Strategy.

Safeguards. The Board approved the measures
introduced by the Bank to put into operation the
Integrated Safeguards System (ISS). It will enable
the Bank to put all its safeguards policies into one
easy-to-access platform to ensure policy coherence
and effective implementation by clients and project
coordinators. This will minimize the effort required to
have a broad view of the Bank’s safeguards system,
and eliminate past misunderstandings.

Return to Abidjan. The Boards of Directors approved
the Return to Headquarters Roadmap Matrix in March
2013, which was subsequently adopted by the Boards
of Governors at the Annual Meetings in Marrakech. The
Boards of Directors oversee the implementation of the
monitoring matrix based on the key triggers: security,
office infrastructure, housing, education and health.
The Boards established a sub-committee to provide
guidance on this important exercise.

6/Chapter 6 Boards’ Oversight Functions and Strategic Responsibilities

Board visits, consultations and other interactions in 2013.
The Boards accepted the invitation from the Ivorian Authorities
to visit the country in February, 2013. The visit was highly
symbolic as it was the first meeting of the full complement of
the Board of Directors in Abidjan in ten years. Board members
had the opportunity to discuss a range of issues with the Ivorian
Authorities and were able to assess the progress made with
respect to triggers for the Bank’s return to its Headquarters.
The conclusions of their mission provided the basis for the
adoption of the Roadmap by the Boards of Governors.

As in previous years, Board members visited a number
of RMCs, chosen on the basis of the insights that they
would bring to the Board’s understanding of the nature
and conditions under which the Bank operates. The visits
provided an opportunity for Board members to listen to the
views of the authorities and what more the Bank could be
doing on the ground. Board members travelled to Togo,
Mauritania, Cameroon and Ghana and were able to consult
with a good number of authorities and other stakeholders.
An important conclusion from these visits was the need to
tailor Bank support more closely to the needs of the countries,
as they have a number of specificities that preclude uniform
treatment. They noted that even fragile states have sections
of their economies that are quite robust and could benefit
from private sector financing and engagement. The Executive
Directors also visited a number of Bank-funded activities to
evaluate results on ground.

In Tunis, the Boards of Directors interacted formally and
informally with the President of the Bank, including at tea
sessions and lunches, enabling a free exchange of views.
There were also a number of dignitaries who addressed the
Board during visits to the Bank in 2013. They included Dr.
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the Chairperson of the African Union
Commission, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, Dr.
Carlos Lopes, the Executive Secretary of the UN Economic
Commission for Africa, the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate
and global micro-credit promoter, Professor Muhammud
Yunus from Bangladesh, Former President, Federal Republic
of Nigeria, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, Dr. Nizar Baraka, former
Minister of Economy and Finance of Morocco, and Dr. Kumi
Naidoo, Executive Director, Greenpeace International.

6.2 Boards of Governors

The Boards of Governors considered the key elements of
Structural Transformation and Natural Resource Management
in Africa, and endorsed the concept of an African Infrastructure
Financing Facility.

The 2013 Annual Meetings of the Boards of Governors of the
African Development Bank and of the Africa Development

68

Fund were held in Marrakech, Morocco from May 27 to
31, 2013 on the theme, Africa’s Structural Transformation,
which was highlighted during several of the sessions. The
Governor's Dialogue examined the modalities of structural
transformation and natural resource management in Africa,
and the key elements needed to attain that objective. The
Dialogue broadened the discussion to all natural resources.
The Governors emphasized good governance, generally
and in natural resource management in particular, including
bold fiscal measures and aggressive investment in human
capital and infrastructure, as key prerequisites for structural
ransformation. With regard to funding Africa’s transformation,
Governors welcomed the Bank's initiative to create Africa50
0 finance Africa’s infrastructure, and encouraged the Bank
Group to work out the financial and regulatory details of the
initiative for its work to begin as soon as possible.

The Board of Governors approved the Roadmap and adopted
he resolution for the return of the African Development Bank
‘0 its Headquarters, as well as other recommendations of the
Governors’ Consultative Committee. Its recommendations
urged close collaboration between the two host countries,
Céte d’lvoire and Tunisia, in implementing the Roadmap, and
he examination of the Business Continuity Plan of the Bank,
including any changes in security alert levels, which might
have an impact on the process. The Board of Governors
also took note of the Roadmap’s monitoring and evaluation
ramework and the budget for its implementation. The Board of
Governors emphasized the importance of carefully managing
he period of transition, bearing in mind the need to ensure the
security and welfare of staff and their families and to minimize
disruptions to Bank Group operations.

 

Other resolutions by the Boards of Governors related to the
adoption of the following: (i) the Annual Reports and Audited
Financial Statements for the ADB and the ADF for the Financial
Year ended December 2012; and (ii) the dates and venues
for the Annual Meetings of the ADB and ADF for 2014, 2015
and 2016, respectively.

Financial Statements and Report of the Independent AuditorDate: March 26, 2014

The Management of the African Development Bank Group (“The Bank Group”) is responsible for the preparation, fair presentation and overall
integrity of its published financial statements. The financial statements for the African Development Bank and the Nigeria Trust Fund have
been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board, while those of the African Development Fund were prepared on a special purpose basis.

The financial statements have been audited by the independent audit firm KPMG, who were given unrestricted access to all financial records
and related data, including minutes of all meetings of the Boards of Directors and committees of the Boards. Management believes that all
representations made to the external auditors during their audit were valid and appropriate. The external auditors’ reports accompany the
audited financial statements.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls over external financial reporting in conformity with
the basis of accounting. The system of internal control contains monitoring mechanisms and actions that are taken to correct deficiencies
identified. Internal controls for external financial reporting are subject to ongoing scrutiny and testing by management and internal audit and
are revised as considered necessary. Management believes that such controls support the integrity and reliability of the financial statements.

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention
or overriding of controls. Accordingly, an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable, as opposed to absolute, assurance with
respect to financial statements’ preparation and presentation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of an internal control system can change over time.

The Boards of Directors of the Bank Group have established an Audit and Finance Committee (AUFI) to assist the Boards, among other
things, in their oversight responsibility for the soundness of the Bank Group’s accounting policies and practices and the effectiveness of
internal controls. AUFI, which is comprised entirely of selected members of the Boards of Directors, oversees the process for the selection
of external auditors and makes recommendation for such selection to the Boards of Directors, which in turn make recommendation for the
approval of the Boards of Governors. AUFI meets periodically with management to review and monitor matters of financial, accounting or
auditing significance. The external auditors and the internal auditors regularly meet with AUFI to discuss the adequacy of internal controls
over financial reporting and any other matter that may require AUFI’s attention.

The Bank's assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls was based on the framework provided by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this assessment, Management asserts that the Bank Group
maintained effective internal controls over its financial reporting as contained in the financial statements as of December 31, 2013. Management
is not aware of any material control weakness that could affect the reliability of the 2013 financial statements.

In addition to providing an audit opinion on the fairness of the financial statements for 2013, the external auditors of the Bank Group conducted
an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the Bank Group's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 and
their opinion thereon is presented separately in this annual report.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank
Group regarding the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting

Year ended 31 December 2013

Scope

We have examined the internal control over financial reporting of the African Development Bank (ADB), the African Development
Fund (ADF) and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) (together the “Bank Group”) as of 31 December 2013, based on criteria established
in “Jnternal Control — Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).

Management’s responsibilities

The management of the Bank Group is responsible for implementing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of such internal control. Management has asserted the effectiveness of internal controls
over financial reporting as of December 31st 2013.

Independent Auditor’s responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank Group’s internal control over financial reporting based on our procedures.

We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, issued by the
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. That standard requires that we plan and perform our procedures to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, effective internal control was maintained over financial reporting.

An assurance engagement includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, based on the assessed
risk. It also includes performing such other procedures as considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that the evidence
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

re)KPMG. African Development Bank Group

Independent Auditor's Report to the Board of Governors
of the African Development Bank Group regarding
the effectiveness of internal controls over external financial reporting

Inherent limitation

An entity’s system of internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. An entity’s system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Further, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion

In our opinion, the Bank Group, in all material respects, maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of 31st
December 2013, based on criteria established in “/nternal Control — Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have audited the financial statements of the African Development Bank, the African Development Fund and the Nigeria Trust
Fund as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing, and we have
expressed unqualified opinions on those financial statements.

14 Annual Report 2013The capital stock of the Bank is composed of paid-up and
callable capital. The paid-up capital is the ammount of capital
payable over a period determined by the Board of Governors’
resolution approving the relevant General Capital Increase.
The Bank’s callable capital is subject to payment as and when
required by the Bank to meet its obligations on borrowing of
funds for inclusion in its ordinary capital resources or guaranees chargeable to such resources. This acts as protection
‘or holders of bonds and guarantees issued by the Bank in
he unlikely event that it is not able to meet its financial obligations. There has never been a call on the callable capital
of the Bank.

Following the Board of Governors’ approval of a 200 percent
increase of the Bank’s capital base in 2010, the authorized
capital of the African Development Bank was increased to
UA 67.69 billion with the creation of 4,374,000 new shares
with a par value of UA 10,000 each. Six percent of the shares
created under this Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI),
(UA 2.62 billion), are paid-up, while ninety-four percent, (UA
41.12 billion), are callable. In accordance with the resolution
governing this capital increase, the GCI-VI shares were allocated to regional and non-regional members in such proportions that, when fully subscribed, the regional group holds 60
percent of the total capital stock and the non-regional group
40 percent. As at December 31, 2013, the subscriptions of
71 member countries (49 regional countries and 22 non-regional countries) have become effective.

 

The paid-up portion of the GCI-VI subscription is payable in
eight equal annual installments for non-regional member as
well as Regional Member Countries eligible to borrow from
ADB, and twelve equal annual installments for Regional
Member Countries eligible to borrow only from ADF. Some
member countries have elected to pay their subscription in
fewer installments, opting for an advance payment scheme,

and will receive a discount on their GCI-VI subscription payment accordingly.

The special capital increase of 16,975 shares to permit the
membership of Turkey was approved in 2008 under Resolution
B/BG/2008/07 and on the same terms and conditions as the
shares authorized in the Fifth General Capital Increase of the
Bank (GCI-V). On October 29, 2013, the Republic of Turkey
was formally admitted as the 78th member country of the
Bank - the 25th non-regional member country. Also in 2012,
there was a special capital increase of 111,469 shares to
permit the membership of South Sudan.

A member country’s payment of the first installment triggers
the issuance of the shares corresponding to the entire callable capital portion, and shares representing the paid-up portion of subscriptions are issued only as and when the Bank
receives the actual payments for such shares. Table 7.1 below
summarizes the evolution of the Bank’s authorized, paid-up,
callable and subscribed capital as at the end of the three
past financial periods.

As at December 31, 2013, the paid-up capital of the Bank
amounted to UA 4.96 billion, with a paid-in capital (i.e. the
portion of paid-up capital that has been actually paid) level of
UA 3.15 billion, compared with UA 4.96 billion and UA 2.84
billion of paid-up and paid-in capital, respectively, at the end
of 2012. The Bank’s callable capital at December 31, 2013
stood at UA 60.25 billion including UA 21.25 billion from
non-borrowing member countries rated A- and higher, compared with UA 60.25 billion and UA 21.18 billion, respectively,
as at the end of the previous year.

In accordance with the Bank’s Share Transfer Rules, shares
for which payment have become due and remain unpaid are
forfeited after a prescribed period and offered for subscription
to member countries within the same membership group (i.e.
regional or non-regional).

Details of the Bank’s capital subscriptions at December 31,
2013 are shown in the Statement of Subscriptions to the

Capital Stock and Voting Powers, which forms part of the
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.

The Bank monitors and manages its key financial strength
metrics in a stringent manner and is rated by four major rating
agencies. For 2013, the rating agencies, Standard & Poor's,
Moody's, Fitch Ratings, and the Japan Credit Rating Agency
have once again reaffirmed their AAA and AA+ rating of the
African Development Bank’s senior and subordinated debts
respectively, with a stable outlook. Their rating reflects and
confirms the Bank's strong liquidity and capital position, strong
membership support, its preferred creditor status, sound capital adequacy and prudent financial management and policies.

The Bank endeavors to raise funds from the capital markets
at the best possible cost to support its lending activities. The
top-notch credit ratings enjoyed by the Bank enables it to
issue securities at cost-effective levels. Its borrowing activities
are guided by client and cash flow requirements, asset and
liability management goals, and risk management policies.

For 2013, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved a
borrowing ceiling of UA 3.76 billion, including up to UA 130
million under the Enhanced Private Sector Assistance (EPSA)
for Africa facility. Actual borrowings in 2013 amounted to UA
3.68 billion, with a weighted average maturity of 5.3 years.

Borrowings in 2013 were in line with the Bank's funding strategy to maintain a regular presence in the Global benchmark
market and strategic domestic markets such as the Australian
Dollar market. Early in 2013, the Bank issued a USD 1 billion
5-year Global benchmark bond which was increased three
times following strong investor interest, bringing the total size
to USD 2.18 billion. This was followed by a second USD 1
billion 5-year Global benchmark in October. In the Australian
dollar market, the Bank was able to start a new 5-year fixedrate line with an initial issue size of AUD 300 million that was
subsequently increased by a further AUD 200 million. The Bank
was also able to start anew 10-year line with an outstanding
size of AUD 275 million as of December 31, 2013.

The Bank has also been active with various private placements,
African currency-linked notes and Uridashi transactions in
Japan. Euro Commercial Paper borrowings complete the
range of products utilized during the year. The Bank conducts
regular buyback operations of notes to facilitate liquidity. As
at December 31, 2013, the Bank’s outstanding borrowing
portfolio stood at UA 12.95 billion.

The 2014 borrowing program was approved by the Board of
Directors for a maximum amount of UA 3.19 billion, compris
16

ing up to UA 3.06 billion to be raised in the capital markets,
and an envelope of UA 130 million under the EPSA facility.

The Bank issued, in late 2013, its debut syndicated “green”
bond transaction, raising USD 500 million that will be allocated to support the financing of low carbon and climate resilient projects in line with the Bank’s long-term strategy which
focuses on inclusive and green growth. The transaction saw
strong interest from socially responsible investment portfolios
with 84 percent of the deal bought by investors motivated
by the green format. The success of this transaction underscores the growing demand from institutional investors for
green bonds from triple-A rated supranational entities. It also
demonstrates the Bank’s commitment to financing Africa’s
transition to green growth and the expected project pipeline.

Table 7.2 provides a breakdown of the specific projects benefitting from the proceeds of the Bank’s green bonds.

Outside of its green bond program, the Bank continues to
be active in issuing uridashi bonds linked to various social
themes. Demand from Japanese retail investors in 2013 has
been focused around the theme of education with the Bank
successfully issuing two education-linked uridashi bonds
in Brazilian Real and raising UA 148 million in the process.
Under the terms of the bonds, an amount equal to the net
proceeds of the sales are directed on a ‘best-efforts’ to lending to projects related to the relevant theme, subject to and in
accordance with the Bank’s lending standards and guidelines.

Table 7.3 provides a snapshot of the Bank’s activity in the
two sectors financed.

The ADB offers an attractive and diversified menu of financial
product options that allows borrowers to tailor their financing requirements to their circumstances. The Bank’s financial
products comprise loans (including those denominated in local
currency, and syndicated loans), lines of credit (including for
trade finance), agency lines, guarantees, equity and quasi-equity, trade finance, and risk management products. In addition
to the aforementioned financial products, the Bank provides
technical assistance to its clients through grant funds. Each
of these products is briefly discussed below:

The ADB provides loans to its clients on non-concessional terms.
The Bank's standard loans are categorized either as SovereignGuaranteed Loans (SGLs) or Non-Sovereign-Guaranteed Loans
(NSGLs). SGLs are loans made to Regional Member Countries
(RMCs) or public sector enterprises from RMCs supported
by the full faith and credit of the RMC in whose territory the

borrower is domiciled. Multinational institutions are eligible for
SGLs if they are guaranteed by an RMC or by RMCs in whose
territory or territories the projects will be executed.

NSGLs are loans made either to public sector enterprises,
without the requirement of a sovereign guarantee or to private sector enterprises.

The Bank’s standard loan product has evolved over time,
with terms that are increasingly more accommodating and
responsive to client needs. The current standard loan product
offered to sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed clients is the
Enhanced Variable Spread Loan (EVSL) which gives borrowers a high degree of flexibility to manage their interest rate
risks. For non-sovereign-guaranteed clients the loan product
offered is the Fixed Spread Loan (FSL).

Annual Report 2013

The lending rate on the EVSL comprises a floating base rate
(6-month LIBOR for USD and YEN, 6-month EURIBOR for
Euro and 3-month JIBAR for ZAR), a funding margin that is
a function of the Bank’s cost of funding relative to LIBOR,
EURIBOR or JIBAR computed every six months, and a contractual spread, that was set at 60 basis points (bps) with
effect from January 1, 2011. At a borrower’s request, the
EVSL offers a free option to convert the floating base rate
into a fixed base rate (amortizing swap rate set at borrower's
request for disbursed loan balances). The repayment period
for sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed loans is up to 20
years, including a grace period not exceeding 5 years.

The lending rate on the FSL comprises a floating base rate
(6-month LIBOR for USD and YEN, 6-month EURIBOR for
Euro and 3-month JIBAR for ZAR) which remains floating
until maturity date or a fixed base rate plus a risk-based

ThChapter 7 African Development Bank

credit spread. NGSLs have repayment periods up to 15 years
including a grace period not exceeding 5 years.

n December 2013, the ADB Board of Directors approved the
introduction of the Fully Flexible Loan (FFL) product to the
suite of products available to sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed borrowers. The FFL embeds risk management feaures currently offered through the Bank’s Risk Management
Products in SGLs, thereby providing full customization flexibility
in interest rate and currency conversion to borrowers. It also
introduces a maturity-based pricing structure and increases
he maximum tenor, grace period and average loan maturity
of SGLs from the current 20, 5 and 12.75 years to 25, 8 and
17 years, respectively. Consequently, this allows borrowers
‘0 select loan profiles that match their funding needs and
debt management capacities.

The lending rate of the FFL product is consistent with that of
he EVSL plus a maturity premium, where applicable. With
maturity-based pricing, loans with maturity less than or equal
0 12.75 years will not attract a maturity premium. However,
loans with maturity greater than 12.75 years but less than
or equal to 15 years will attract a 10 bps maturity premium,
while loans with maturity greater than 15 years will attract a
20 bps maturity premium.

 

The FFL will be available as the Bank’s standard loan product
offered to sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed borrowers,
starting from the date of approval of the conversion guidelines to be issued by Management in 2014.

Other loan structures offered by the Bank include parallel and
A/B loan syndications, and local currency loans. In December
2012, the President approved the introduction of five additional African currencies - Franc CFA currencies (XOF and XAF),
Tanzanian Shilling, Zambian Kwacha and Ghanaian Cedi to the
existing selection of lending currencies of Regional Member
Countries. Lending in these currencies is only offered if the
Bank is able to fund efficiently in the relevant local currency
market. These local currency loans are offered under the FSL
pricing framework with a cost-pass-through principle for the
loans to ensure that the overall cost of funds is fully covered.

The development of a dynamic small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) sector in the continent is an important objective
of the Bank as is the development of private financial institutions (PFls). To this end the Bank offers lines of credit for
loans to PFls for on-lending to SMEs. The terms of the lines
of credit specify the conditions under which Bank funds will
be provided to the PFI for on-lending. The credit risks of the
sub-loans are borne by the PFls.

78

The Bank makes resources available for SMEs under agency
arrangements with local financial intermediaries. The selection
of individual projects for Bank support is largely delegated to
he intermediaries, which draw on Bank resources to make
loan or equity investments for the Bank’s account in projects
meeting pre-agreed criteria. As part of an agency agreement,
inancial intermediaries are required to commit their own funds
in each investment in parallel with the Bank and to supervise
he investee companies. The financial intermediary acts only
in an agency capacity for the Bank when investing the latter’s
unds and assumes no risk in this regards. The credit risk of
he borrower is borne by the Bank.

Through the guarantee product, the Bank seeks to leverage its
preferred creditor status to assist eligible borrowers to obtain
inancing from third party lenders, including capital markets.
Guarantees also enable borrowers to obtain financing in their
own local currency where the Bank is not able to provide such
inancing directly from its own resources. The Bank’s guarantees
can generally be classified into two categories: Partial Credit
Guarantees (PCGs) and Partial Risk Guarantees (PRGs). PCGs
cover a portion of scheduled repayments of private sector loans
or bonds against all risks. PRGs cover private lenders against
the risk of a government, or a government-owned agency, failing to perform its obligations vis-a-vis a private sector project.

 

The Bank offers Risk Management Products (RMPs) to its borrowers only in respect of obligations outstanding to the Bank
or new Bank loans to enable them to hedge their exposure
to market risks including interest rate, currency exchange
and commodity price risks, thus allowing them to optimize
their debt management strategies. RMPs offered by the Bank
include interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity
swaps and interest rate caps and collars. These products are
available to borrowers at any time during the life of the loan.

In addition to its participation in the ADF, the Bank takes
equity positions in qualifying business enterprises in its RMCs
as part of its strategic development financing mandate. The
Bank’s ability to provide risk capital through equity and quasi-equity is a key element of its resource mobilization role. The
use by the Bank of equity and quasi-equity participation as
instruments of investment have the objectives of promoting
the efficient use of resources, promoting African participation, playing a catalytic role in attracting other investors and
lenders to financially viable projects as well as promoting
new activities and investment ideas. The Bank may invest in
equities either directly or indirectly, through appropriate funds
and other investment vehicles. Additionally, it may choose

Annual Report 2013to invest via quasi-equity instruments including redeemable
preference shares, preferred stock, subordinated loans or
convertible loans.

In February 2018, the Board approved a Trade Finance Program
(the “Program”) of up to USD 1 billion for a 4-year initial phase,
to address the shortage of trade finance for Regional Member
Countries (RMCs) and to address the structural gap between
the demand for trade finance and the market supply through
provision of liquidity and risk mitigation solutions to financial
institutions actively involved in trade finance in Africa.

The Program provides to eligible clients, funded and unfunded products including: (a) Risk Participation Agreements
(Guarantee), (b) Trade Finance Lines of Credit, (c) Soft
Commodity Finance Facilities.

The Risk Participation Agreement (RPA) is both a funded and
a non-funded trade finance product that enables the Bank
to share risk with a select group of international and regional
confirming banks, who provide documentary credit confirmation services to African issuing banks, with the objective of
supporting and expanding trade in Africa. Under this product the Bank shares trade finance credit risk (generally no
more than 50 percent of a trade transaction exposure) on a
portfolio of eligible Issuing Bank trade transactions of partner confirming banks. RPAs operate on a portfolio basis and
do not require the Bank to sign direct agreements with the
local Issuing Banks.

The Trade Finance Line of Credit (TFLOC) is similar to the
conventional line of credit offered by the Bank to local financial institutions except that the TFLOC will be used to finance
exclusively trade-related transactions in RMCs. TFLOC is used
to finance trade transactions, which include among others,
pre-shipment and post-shipment financing, capital expenditure, letters of credit discounting, factoring/forfaiting, import
and export trade finance. Capital expenditure refers mainly
to purchase of machinery and plant/warehouse extensions
that are directly related to growth in international trade business. These are capital investments used in the production
of tradable goods.

 

Considering that most trade transactions have maturities
of less than one year, the intermediary financial institutions
would utilize the line of credit as a revolving credit facility to
trade finance clients until the final maturity of the TFLOC itself,
which in any case will not exceed 3.5 years. The facility is
available to local banks engaged in trade finance in Africa.

Annual Report 2013

African Development Bank Chapter 7

The Soft Commodity Finance Facility (CFF) is a funded trade
finance product that is used to support mainly the import and
export of agricultural commodities and inputs across RMCs.
This will include, for instance, the provision of pre-export
financing to commodity aggregators for the purchase and
export of soft commodities. Commodity finance is usually
structured and has credit protection in such forms as pledge
of underlying commodity, assignment of proceeds, letters
of credit, and private or state guarantees. SCFF is provided
directly to entities such as commodity aggregators, which
are not necessarily financial institutions. These entities could
include state-owned commodity boards or agricultural cooperatives that meet the eligibility criteria for Bank private sector
borrowing. Intermediaries such as commodity traders would
not be direct counterparties of the Bank.

In addition to the products described above, the Bank may
occasionally offer technical assistance through grant funds
to supplement its financial products for both the public and
private sector windows. The Bank’s technical assistance is
primarily focused on increasing the development outcomes
of its operations raising the effectiveness of project preparation which is vital in ensuring the best developmental and
poverty-reducing outcomes for projects that receive Bank
financing. In addition, technical assistance may aim to foster
and sustain efforts in creating enabling business environment
in order to promote private sector investment and growth.

 

The Bank’s development operations are undertaken within
a risk management framework which includes: (i) a clearly
defined risk appetite statement for lending credit risk, (ii) a
capital adequacy and exposure management policy (iii) credit policy; (iv) risk management governance framework; (iii)
credit risk management guidelines; and (iv) an end-to-end
credit process.

The Bank seeks to minimize its exposure to risks that are
not essential to its core business of providing development
finance and related assistance. Accordingly, the Bank’s risk
management policies, guidelines and practices are designed
to reduce exposure to interest rate, currency, liquidity, counterparty, legal and other operational risks, while maximizing
the Bank’s capacity to assume credit risks to public and private sector clients, within approved risk limits.

Over the past few years the Bank has considerably enhanced
its risk management framework and end-to-end credit processes to ensure that its risk management functions remain
robust. Some of the specific measures taken have included:
(i) creation of the office of Group Chief Risk Officer, reporting

7Chapter 7 African Development Bank

directly to the President of the Bank; (ii) strengthening of the
Credit Risk Committee; (iii) enhancement of the credit risk
assessment skills of Bank staff through training and hiring of
experienced and competent credit officers; (iv) implementaion of robust and optimized credit risk assessment models;
(v) strengthening of the credit risk infrastructure by improving
quality at entry; and, (vi) implementation of best-of-breed soluions in the form of an integrated and workflow-driven software
platform that allows all stakeholders involved in the credit
risk assessment process to streamline their work in order to
enhance efficiency. The Bank has, additionally, strengthened
he monitoring of the current portfolio and continued to proactively undertake portfolio restructuring measures including
he cancellation of long-standing “signed but not disbursed”
loans to free up capital for new lending.

The Bank continues to serve all its member countries, including
hose under stress. To support such continued engagement,
he Bank maintains capital buffers to provide some flexibility
in continuing its countercyclical financing role, while covering
any potential unexpected losses. Close collaboration with
sister institutions has helped to improve the coordination of
current and future interventions in those countries. Above all,
the Bank has continued to explore measures to increase portfolio diversification, an important step in its efforts to mitigate
concentration risks within its current portfolio. The Bank also
improved its collateral management framework to ensure that
an adequate collateral value is maintained.

 

The Bank continues to be well capitalized. The stress testing
of its capital adequacy shows that it can adequately withstand a number of extreme shock scenarios. The risks to
the Bank's balance sheet are actively monitored on a risk
dashboard developed in 2012.

The policies and practices employed by the Bank to manage
these risks are described in detail in Note D to the Financial
Statements.

Corporate governance within the Bank is supported by appropriate financial and management reporting. The Executive
Board of Directors makes strategic decisions and monitors
the Bank’s progress toward achievement of set goals. While
senior management manages the Bank’s day-to-day operations and activities, the Board provides oversight, advice
and counsel on issues as wide-ranging as long-term strategy,
budgets, human resources, benefits management and new
product development.

Based on the COSO internal control framework, senior management has put in place a robust and functioning mechanism to be able to certify the effectiveness of the Bank’s
internal controls over external financial reporting. This annual

80

certification statement is signed by the President and Vice
President — Finance, as well as the Financial Controller. A
separate attestation is also provided by the Bank’s external
auditors. The Bank has a comprehensive system of reporting
to the Board of Directors and its committees which includes
periodic reporting by the Office of the Auditor General to the
Audit and Finance (AUFI) Committee of the Board of Directors.

The Bank’s external auditors are appointed by the Board of
Governors, on the recommendation of the Board of Directors,
for a five-year term. Under Bank rules, no firm of auditors can
serve for more than two consecutive five-year terms.

The external audit function is statutory and is regulated by
the International Standards on Auditing (ISA), issued by the
International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) through the
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The
external auditors perform an annual audit to enable them to
express an opinion on whether the financial statements of the
Bank present fairly the financial position and the results of the
operations of the Bank. They also examine whether the statements have been presented in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards. In addition, as described above,
the external auditors also carry out a comprehensive review
and provide opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal
controls over financial reporting. This attestation is provided by
the external auditors as a report separate from the audit opinion.
At the conclusion of their annual audit, the external auditors
prepare a management letter for Senior Management and the
Board of Directors, which is reviewed in detail and discussed
with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board. The management letter sets out the external auditors’ observations and
recommendations for improvement on internal controls and
other matters, and it includes management's responses and
actions for implementation of the auditors’ recommendations.

The performance and independence of the external auditors
is subject to periodic review by the AUF| Committee of the
Board. There are key provisions in the Bank's policy regarding
the independence of the external auditors including a requirement for the mandatory rotation of the Engagement Partner, in
cases where the term of the audit firm is renewed for a second
and final five-year period. The external auditors are prohibited
from providing non-audit related services, subject to certain
exceptions if it is judged to be in the interest of the Bank and

if such services do not compromise the external auditors’
independence. The provision of such services are required to
be specially approved by the Audit and Finance Committee.

The Bank has a robust regime for discouraging corruption. The
prohibited practices under the Bank’s anti-corruption regime

Annual Report 2013include not only bribery but also receiving bribes, fraud, coercive practices and collusion.

The Bank has three main anti-corruption legal instruments
— its Procurement Rules, the Guidelines for Preventing and
Combating Corruption and Fraud in Bank’s Operations, and
the International Financial Institutions’ Uniform Framework
for Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption. Each
of these instruments defines the prohibited practices and
prescribes mechanisms for implementing anti-corruption
measures. The Procurement Rules prohibit the use of Bank
funds to finance corruption and the financing by the Bank of
contracts corruptly procured. The Guidelines prescribe preventive measures to be taken throughout the lending cycle.
The Uniform Framework also prescribes preventive measures
and investigation procedures.

The Bank’s anti-corruption implementation mechanisms
include the Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department which
has an investigative and a preventive role, a Whistleblower and
Complaints Handling mechanism including a hotline administered by the Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department, and
protection for whistleblowers.

The Bank has implemented the International Financial Institutions’
cross-debarment agreement by which it will apply the sanctions of the other institutions and have its sanctions applied
by these institutions. A key step in this process has been
the appointment of a Sanctions Commissioner, an Alternate

African Development Bank Chapter 7

Sanctions Commissioner and the members of the Sanctions
Appeals Board.

Finally, the Bank is collaborating with the OECD in an ongoing
initiative to support business integrity and anti-bribery efforts
in its Regional Member Countries.

In managing its operations the Bank uses quantified performance measures and indicators that reflect the critical success factors in its business. These are monitored on a continuous basis and results achieved are used to assess progress
attained against stated objectives and to inform required action
in order to improve future performance. Management uses a
wide array of measures both at the corporate and business
unit level to monitor and manage performance. Some of the
key measures and indicators used by management are discussed in Table 7.4 below together with their relevance to
the operations of the Bank.

The highlights of the Bank’s financial performance in 2013
include the following:

¢ Net interest margins (NIM) continued to be under pressure in
2013. Although the average gross earning assets remained
virtually the same as for the prior year, net interest income
declined significantly during the period. Income on loans
declined by 4.60 percent, while total investment income in

absolute terms declined by 35.60 percent as a result of the
declining short-term interest rates.

The Bank in 2013 earned income before allocation and distributions approved by the Board of Governors of UA 180.33
million compared to UA 195.71 million in 2012. The decrease
in 2013 is primarily driven by lower loan and investment
income which decreased from UA 553.64 million in 2012
to UA 465.41 million in 2013. As a result of the increase in
impairment provision on non-sovereign-guaranteed loans,
impairment charge on loan principal and charges receivable
also increased from UA 29.69 million in 2012 to UA 41.14
million for the current period. At December 31, 2013, loan
impairment represented 1.25 percent of disbursed and
outstanding loans on that date, compared to 1.17 percent
at the end of the previous year.

The Bank's share of the total Bank Group administrative
expenses amounted to UA 110.97 million for 2013 compared to UA 107.55 million for 2012, an increase of 3.18
percent. The Bank’s share represented 31.19 percent of
the total Bank Group administrative expenses in 2013 compared to 33.90 percent in 2012.

The Bank continues to maintain a strong capital position.
Income levels, while under downward pressure due to the
factors described earlier, continue to be sufficient to support
contributions on behalf of its shareholders to other development initiatives in Africa. Shareholders’ equity increased
by UA 490 million, from UA 5.34 billion at the end of 2012
to VA 5.83 billion as at December 31, 2013.

In 2013, the Board of Governors approved distributions from
income to various development initiatives in Africa amounting
to UA 107.5 million. The beneficiaries of these distributions
are listed under Note N to the financial statements. In accordance with the Bank’s accounting policies, such distributions
are reported as expenses in the year they are approved by
the Board of Governors. The Boards of Directors have also
agreed to recommend to the Board of Governors, at its Annual
Meeting in May 2014, distributions from income totaling UA
120 million to various development initiatives in RMCs.

The Bank has an ongoing responsibility and commitment to
ensure maximum efficiency in the management of administrative and capital expenditures, to help maximize the resources
available for development financing and technical assistance
activities in its member countries. Accordingly, in the management of its administrative and capital expenses, the Bank
continues to focus on a high level of budgetary discipline,
effective cost controls and proactive cost-recovery programs.

82

Excluding the impact of the actuarial valuation of the Staff
benefit Plans, actual administrative expenses incurred were
within the approved budgets for the year. For 2014, the Bank’s
administrative expenditure is budgeted at UA 374.76 million.
Management will continue to explore and implement effective
and transparent cost management strategies with a view to
ensuring that cost outcomes are effectively tracked against
the Bank’s long-term strategic objectives.

The Bank's investment strategy is regularly adapted to the
rapidly changing global financial market environment with
the primary objectives of strengthening the credit quality and
liquidity profile of the investment portfolios while limiting the
volatility of their returns. Despite a continuing challenging,
stressed and, sometimes, volatile financial market environment,
the Bank benefited from its conservative investment strategy that allowed its treasury portfolio to continue to perform
reasonably well and sometimes above their set benchmark .

The Bank’s cash and treasury investments (net of repurchase
agreements) as of December 31, 2013 totaled UA 7.04 billion,
compared to VA 7.37 billion at the end of 2012. Investment
income for 2013 amounted to UA 126.45 million or a return of
1.59 percent on an average liquidity of UA 7.97 billion, compared to an income of UA 197.65 million, or a return of 2.31
percent, on an average liquidity of UA 8.57 billion in 2012.

Even though the portfolio held at fair value significantly outperformed their benchmark during the year, total investment
income generated in 2013 was lower than the previous year
as (1) the average liquidity invested in 2013 was approximately
UA 0.6 billion lower than that of 2012, and (2) the investment
portfolio did not benefit from the exceptional credit spreads
compression seen in 2012 which generated large capital
gains in that year.

The ADB's liquid assets are tranched into 3 portfolios, namely
operational portfolio, prudential portfolio, and equity-backed
portfolio, each with a different benchmark that reflects the
cash flow and risk profile of its assets and funding sources.
These benchmarks are 1-month LIBID for the operational
portfolio, and 6-month marked-to-market LIBOR, resetting
on February 1 and August 1 for the prudential portfolio. The
operational and prudential portfolios are held for trading.
The equity-backed portfolio is managed against a repricing
profile benchmark with 10 percent of the Bank’s net assets
repricing uniformly over a period of 10 years, and is held at
amortized cost.

The Bank makes loans to its Regional Member Countries
and public sector enterprises guaranteed by the government.

and repayments for the period 2009-2013.

Although the continuing uncertainty and challenges in the
global macro-economic, political, financial markets and reporting environments are expected to impact the Bank's financial
results given their sensitivity to changes in these domains, the
Bank will continue to monitor such impacts on the volume of
its lending and the timing of repayment of its loans to ensure
that its development mandate is not significantly adversely
affected. In 2013, the Bank approved a new ten-year strategy
which will shape its operations over the ten-year period of
2013 to 2022. The ten-year strategy defined the objectives
and areas of operational priorities for the Bank. The strategy
focuses on two objectives of inclusive growth and transition
to green growth, with five operational priorities including infrastructure development, regional integration, private sector
development, governance and accountability, and skills and
technology. In implementing the ten-year strategy and as an
integral part of the two objectives, the Bank will pay particular
attention to fragile states, agriculture and food security, and
gender. The operational activities of the Bank in 2014 and
subsequent years will be guided by the new strategy.

During 2014 the Bank is expected to complete its move back
to its statutory headquarters in Abidjan, in Cote d'Ivoire. While
this move is expected to restore stability and therefore efficiency
in the Bank’s operational set up in the long term, in the short

84

term, it will result in an increase in the level of administrative
expenses, particularly for 2014 and 2015.

The anticipated continuing volatility in the financial markets and

in the operating economic environment will likely continue to
put pressure on the Bank’s business model and processes
and the flexibility to deliver in a variety of market conditions
going forward. At the same time, the continuing impact of
sociopolitical instability in certain parts of the continent is
resulting in rapid changes in the economic environment
and increased expectations from these borrowing member
countries for an appropriate response. These changes are
creating new opportunities for innovation and diversification
of the Bank’s portfolio in these countries and all across the
rest of sub-Saharan Africa where the Bank’s lending portfolio has traditionally been low. However, by continuing to
put its RMCs clients’ needs at the center of its business
operations and taking proactive steps to further reduce
costs and improve operational efficiency, the Bank expects
to continue to enhance its support for economic growth in
its RMCs more broadly and generate the required target
financial returns over time.

The Bank has taken significant strategic steps to ensure
that it has the necessary flexibility and responsiveness not
only to sustain growth in its business operations but also to
meet the challenges ahead. The launching and implementation of its long-term strategy is a key pillar in this regard.
The ongoing institutionalization of the “One Bank” business
model across its operations is also expected to further facilitate the harnessing of development resources to those of
its sister institutions, the African Development Fund and the
Nigeria Trust Fund, for the benefit of its RMCs. These initiatives, together with the Bank’s rock-solid capital, liquidity and
strong funding positions means that the Bank is well positioned to effectively support its Regional Member Countries
in the challenging times ahead.

At the corporate level the ongoing fine-tuning of the Bank’s
organization structure and the recent additional IT investments made by the Bank via the upgrade to its integrated
SAP ERP system is expected to drive operational efficiency
and the delivery of faster and more efficient service to customers. This should also enhance a more effective cost monitoring and management. The move back to its headquarters
also requires the Bank’s information technology system to be
carefully managed including ensuring that the data centre is
optimally located so as to facilitate the necessary real-time
access and system availability to support the Bank’s business needs and provide business continuity with connectivity
across the Bank’s entire IT infrastructure network.

Annual Report 2013 9Chapter 7 African Development Bank

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013

The African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to the economic and social progress of its regional member states. The Bank’s headquarters is located in Abidjan, Céte d’lvoire. However,
since February 2008, the Bank has managed its operations largely from its temporary relocation facilities in Tunis, Tunisia. The
Bank finances development projects and programs in its regional member states, typically in cooperation with other national
or international development institutions. In furtherance of this objective, the Bank participates in the selection, study and
preparation of projects contributing to such development and, where necessary, provides technical assistance. The Bank
also promotes investments of public and private capital in projects and programs designed to contribute to the economic
and social progress of the regional member states. The activities of the Bank are complemented by those of the African
Development Fund (ADF or the Fund), which was established by the Bank and certain countries; and the Nigeria Trust Fund
(NTF), which is a special fund administered by the Bank. The ADB, ADF, and NTF each have separate and distinct assets
and liabilities. There is no recourse to the ADB for obligations in respect of any of the ADF or NTF liabilities. The ADF was
established to assist the Bank in contributing to the economic and social development of the Bank’s regional members, to
promote cooperation and increased international trade particularly among the Bank’s members, and to provide financing on
concessional terms for such purposes.

In accordance with Article 57 of the Agreement Establishing the Bank, the Bank, its property, other assets, income and its
operations and transactions shall be exempt from all taxation and customs duties. The Bank is also exempt from any obligation to pay, withhold or collect any tax or duty.

The Bank’s individual financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board. The financial statements have been prepared under the hisorical cost convention except for certain financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value.

The significant accounting policies applied by the Bank in preparation of the financial statements are summarized below.
nterest income is accrued and recognized based on the effective interest rate for the time such instrument is outstanding and
held by the Bank. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected

ife of the financial asset to the asset’s net carrying amount.

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments measured at fair value
hrough profit or loss.

 

Dividends are recognized in income statement when the Bank’s right to receive the dividends is established in accordance
with IAS 18 — Revenue.

92 Annual Report 2013African Development Bank Chapter 7

The Bank conducts its operations in the currencies of its member countries. As a result of the application of IAS 21 revised,
“The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”, the Bank prospectively changed its functional currency from the currencies of all its member countries to the Unit of Account (UA) effective January 1, 2005, as it was concluded that the UA most
faithfully represented the aggregation of economic effects of the underlying transactions, events and conditions of the Bank
conducted in different currencies. The UA is also the currency in which the financial statements are presented. The value of
the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (6) of the Agreement establishing the Bank (the Agreement) as equivalent to one
Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF.

Income and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. The rates used for translating currencies into UA at
December 31, 2013 and 2012 are reported in Note V-1. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated into UA at historical rates. Translation differences are included in the determination of net income. Capital subscriptions are recorded in UA at
the rates prevailing at the time of receipt. The translation difference relating to payments of capital subscriptions is reported
in the financial statements as the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS). This is composed of the difference between the UA amount at the predetermined rate and the UA amount using the rate at the time of receipt. When
currencies are converted into other currencies, the resulting gains or losses are included in the determination of net income.

Although the Agreement establishing the ADB allows for a member country to withdraw from the Bank, no member has ever
withdrawn its membership voluntarily, nor has any indicated to the Bank that it intends to do so. The stability in the membership reflects the fact that the members are African and non-African countries, committed to the purpose of the Bank
to contribute to the sustainable economic development and social progress of its Regional Member Countries individually
and jointly. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2013, the Bank did not expect to distribute any portion of its net assets due to
member country withdrawals.

In the unlikely event of a withdrawal by a member, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of the former member's shares.
The repurchase price of the shares is the value shown by the books of the Bank on the date the country ceases to be a member, hereafter referred to as “the termination date”. The Bank may partially or fully offset amounts due for shares purchased
against the member's liabilities on loans and guarantees due to the Bank. The former member would remain liable for direct
obligations and contingent liabilities to the Bank for so long as any parts of the loans or guarantees contracted before the
termination date are outstanding. If at a date subsequent to the termination date, it becomes evident that losses may not
have been sufficiently taken into account when the repurchase price was determined, the former member may be required
to pay, on demand, the amount by which the repurchase price of the shares would have been reduced had the losses been
taken into account when the repurchase price was determined. In addition, the former member remains liable on any call,
subsequent to the termination date, for unpaid subscriptions, to the extent that it would have been required to respond if the
impairment of capital had occurred and the call had been made at the time the repurchase price of its shares was determined.

Were a member to withdraw, the Bank may set the dates in respect of payments for shares repurchased. If, for example,
paying a former member would have adverse consequences for the Bank’s financial position, the Bank could defer payment
until the risk had passed, and indefinitely if appropriate. Furthermore, shares that become unsubscribed for any reason may
be offered by the Bank for purchase by eligible member countries, based on the share transfer rules approved by the Board
of Governors. In any event, no payments shall be made until six months after the termination date.

If the Bank were to terminate its operations, all liabilities of the Bank would first be settled out of the assets of the Bank and
then, if necessary, out of members’ callable capital, before any distribution could be made to any member country. Such
distribution is subject to the prior decision of the Board of Governors of the Bank and would be based on the pro-rata share
of each member country.

Annual Report 2013 93Chapter 7 African Development Bank

The Bank operates a contributory defined benefit pension plan for its employees. The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP) provides
benefit payments to participants upon retirement. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension
benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service
and compensation. An actuarial valuation of the cost of providing benefits for the SRP is determined using the Projected
Unit Credit Method. Upon reaching retirement age, pension is calculated based on the average remuneration for the final
hree years of pensionable service and the pension is subject to annual inflationary adjustments. Actuarial gains and losses
as well as the differences between expected and real returns on assets are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income in the year they occur. When benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in
benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognized immediately in profit or loss. The pension
iability is recognized as part of other accounts payable in the balance sheet. The liability represents the present value of the
Bank’s defined benefit obligations, net of the fair value of plan assets.

The Bank operates a contributory defined Medical Benefit Plan (MBP), which provides post-employment healthcare benefits
0 eligible former staff, including retirees. Membership of the MBP includes both staff and retirees of the Bank. The entitlement
‘0 the post-retirement healthcare benefit is usually conditional on the employee contributing to the Plan up to retirement age
and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits derive from contributions from plan
members as well as the Bank and are accrued over the period of employment and during retirement. Contributions by the
Bank to the MBP are charged to expenses and included in the income statement. The MBP Board, an independent body
created by the Bank, determines the adequacy of the contributions and is authorized to recommend changes to the contribution rates of both the Bank and plan members. Actuarial gains and losses as well as the difference between expected
and real return on assets are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income in the year they occur. The medical
plan liability is recognized as part of other accounts payable in the balance sheet. The liability represents the present value
of the Bank’s post-employment medical benefit obligations, net of the fair value of plan assets.

 

Further details and analysis of the Bank’s employees benefits are included in Note R — Employee Benefits.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized on the Bank’s balance sheet when the Bank assumes related contractual rights or obligations.

In accordance with IFRS 9, the Bank manages its financial assets in line with the applicable business model and, accordingly, classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at amortized cost; financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss (FVTPL); and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOC)). In line with
the Bank’s business model, financial assets are held either for the stabilization of income through the management of net
interest margin or for liquidity management. The Bank’s investments in the equity of enterprises, whether in the private or
public sector is for the promotion of economic development of its member countries and not for trading to realize fair value
changes. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

A financial asset is classified as at ‘amortized cost’ only if the asset meets two criteria: the objective of the Bank’s business
model is to hold the asset to collect the contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to
cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. The nature of any derivatives
embedded in debt investment are considered in determining whether the cash flows of the investment are solely payment
of principal and interest on the principal outstanding and are not accounted for separately.

 

If either of the two criteria above is not met, the financial asset is classified as at fair value through profit or loss.

94 Annual Report 2013African Development Bank Chapter 7

Financial assets at amortized cost include some loans and receivables on amounts advanced to borrowers and certain
debt investments that meet the criteria of financial assets at amortized cost. Receivables comprise demand obligations,
accrued income and receivables from loans and investments and other amounts receivable. Loans and receivables meeting the two criteria above are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Loan origination fees are deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment of yield. However,
incremental direct costs associated with originating loans are expensed as incurred; as such amounts are considered
insignificant. The amortization of loan origination fee is included in income from loans.

Investments classified as financial assets at amortized cost include investments that are non-derivative financial assets
with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities. These investments are carried and subsequently measured at
amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Debt instruments that do not meet the amortized cost criteria as described above are measured at FVTPL. This category includes all treasury assets held for resale to realize short-term fair value changes as well as certain loans for which
either of the criteria for recognition at amortized cost is not met. Gains and losses on these financial assets are reported
in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Derivatives are also categorized as financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss.

In addition, debt instruments that meet amortized cost criteria can be designated and measured at FVTPL. A debt instrument may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a
measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the gains
and losses on them on different bases.

On initial recognition, the Bank can make an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate
investments in equity instruments not held for trading as financial assets measured at FVTOCI.

Equity investments are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income. The cumulative
gains or losses are not reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the investments and no impairments are recognized in
the profit or loss. Dividends earned from such investments are recognized in profit and loss unless the dividends clearly
represent a repayment of part of the cost of the investment.

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized or derecognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which
the Bank commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers. Financial
assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial
assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Bank has
transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Securities purchased under resale agreements, securities lent under securities lending agreements, and securities sold under
repurchase agreements are recorded at market rates. The Bank receives securities purchased under resale agreements,
monitors the fair value of the securities and, if necessary, closes out transactions and enters into new repriced transactions.
The securities transferred to counterparties under the repurchase and security lending arrangements and the securities
transferred to the Bank under the resale agreements do not meet the accounting criteria for treatment as a sale. Therefore,
securities transferred under repurchase agreements and security lending arrangements are retained as assets on the Bank

lance sheet, and securities received under resale agreements are not recorded on the Bank balance sheet. In cases where

the Bank enters into a “reverse repo” — that is, purchases an asset and simultaneously enters into an agreement to resell the
same at a fixed price on a future date — a receivable from reverse repurchase agreement is recognized in the statement of
financial position and the underlying asset is not recognized in the financial statements.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments that
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a time to
maturity upon acquisition of three months or less.

In the ordinary course of its business, the Bank borrows funds in the major capital markets for lending and liquidity management purposes. The Bank issues debt instruments denominated in various currencies, with differing maturities at fixed
or variable interest rates. The Bank’s borrowing strategy is driven by three major factors, namely: timeliness in meeting
cash flow requirements, optimizing asset and liability management with the objective of mitigating exposure to financial
risks, and providing cost-effective funding.

In addition to long and medium-term borrowings, the Bank also undertakes short-term borrowing for cash and liquidity
management purposes only. Borrowings not designated at fair value through profit or loss are carried on the balance
sheet at amortized cost with interest expense determined using the effective interest method. Borrowing expenses are
recognized in profit or loss and include the amortization of issuance costs, discounts and premiums, which is determined
using the effective interest method. Borrowing activities may create exposure to market risk, most notably interest rate
and currency risks.

The Bank uses derivatives and other risk management approaches to mitigate such risks. Details of the Bank’s risk management policies and practices are contained in Note D to these financial statements. Certain of the Bank’s borrowings
obtained prior to 1990, from the governments of certain member countries of the Bank, are interest-free loans. In accordance with the provisions of IAS 20 — Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, such
borrowings are carried at the amounts at which they are repayable on their due dates.

This category has two sub-categories: financial liabilities held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit
or loss at inception. Derivatives are categorized as held-for-trading. The Bank applies fair value designation primarily to
borrowings that have been swapped into floating-rate debt using derivative contracts. In these cases, the designation of
the borrowing at fair value through profit or loss is made in order to significantly reduce accounting mismatches that otherwise would have arisen if the borrowings were carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost while the related swaps
are carried on the balance sheet at fair value.

In accordance with IFRS 9, fair value changes for financial liabilities that are designated as at fair value through profit or

loss, that is attributable to changes in the Bank’s “own credit” risk is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes
in fair value attributable to the Bank’s credit risk are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss.

All financial liabilities that are not derivatives or designated at fair value through profit or loss are recorded at amortized
cost. The amounts include certain borrowings, accrued finance charges on borrowings and other accounts payable.

Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are discharged or canceled or when they expire.

Annual Report 2013African Development Bank Chapter 7

The Bank uses derivative instruments in its portfolios for asset/liability management, cost reduction, risk management and
hedging purposes. These instruments are mainly cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The derivatives on borrowings are used to modify the interest rate or currency characteristics of the debt the Bank issues. This economic relationship
is established on the date the debt is issued and maintained throughout the terms of the contracts. The interest component
of these derivatives is reported as part of borrowing expenses.

The Bank classifies all derivatives at fair value, with all changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. When the
criteria for the application of the fair value option are met, then the related debt is also carried at fair value with changes in
fair value recognized in the income statement.

The Bank assesses its hybrid financial assets (i.e. the combined financial asset host and embedded derivative) in its entirety
to determine their classification. A hybrid financial asset is measured at amortized cost if the combined cash flows represent
solely principal and interest on the outstanding principal; otherwise it is measured at fair value. As at December 31, 2013,
the Bank had hybrid financial assets that were measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9.

Derivatives embedded in financial liabilities or other non-financial host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when
their risks and characteristics were not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract was not carried
at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in profit or loss. Such derivatives were stripped from the host contract
and measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in profit or loss.

The Bank applies fair value hedge accounting to interest rate swaps contracted to hedge the interest rate risk exposure
associated with its fixed rate loans. Under fair value hedge accounting, the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument
and the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in the income statement.

At inception of the hedge, the Bank documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along
with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception
of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Bank documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting
changes in fair values of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Bank
revokes the hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no
longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The cumulative fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortized to profit or loss from that date.

The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Bank determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in
a group of financial assets with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a
collective assessment of impairment. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are
incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows
of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

If the Bank determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or investments
carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the
asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not
been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. For sovereign-guaranteed loans, the estimated impairment representing present value losses arises from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts due.
For non-sovereign-guaranteed loans, the impairment reflects management's best estimate of the non-collectability, in whole
or in part, of amounts due as well as delays in the receipt of such amounts.

Annual Report 2013 97Chapter 7 African Development Bank

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the income statement. If a loan or investment carried at amortized cost has a variable interest rate, the discount rate
for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. Interest and charges are accrued on all loans including those in arrears. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to
decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and reported on a net basis when there is a current legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts. A current legally enforceable right exists if the right is not contingent on a future event and is
enforceable both in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the entity and
all counterparties and there is an intention on the part of the Bank to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle
the liability simultaneously. The Bank discloses all recognized financial instruments that are set off and those subject to an
enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset. Information relating
to financial assets and liabilities that are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangement is provided in Note D.

In liquid or active markets, the most reliable indicators of fair value are quoted market prices. A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group,
pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an
arm’s length basis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive. Indications that a market might
be inactive include when there is a wide bid-offer spread or significant increase in the bid-offer spread or there are few or no
recent transactions observed in the market. When markets become illiquid or less active, market quotations may not represent the prices at which orderly transactions would take place between willing buyers and sellers and therefore may require
adjustment in the valuation process. Consequently, in an inactive market, price quotations are not necessarily determinative
of fair values. Considerable judgment is required to distinguish between active and inactive markets.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities that are traded in active
markets are based on quoted market prices or dealer price quotations. For all other financial instruments the Bank measures
fair values using other valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs.

The objective of the valuation techniques applied by the Bank is to arrive at a reliable fair value measurement.

Other valuation techniques include net present value, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, comparison to
similar instruments for which market observable prices exists and other valuation models commonly used by market participants. Assumptions and inputs used in valuation techniques include risk free and benchmark interest rates, credit spreads
and other premiums used in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and expected price volatilities and correlations.

The Bank uses widely recognized valuation models for measuring the fair value of common and more simple financial instruments, like interest rate and currency swaps that use only observable market data and require little management judgment
and estimation. Availability of observable market prices and model inputs reduces the need for management judgment and
estimation and also reduces the uncertainty associated with the measurement of fair value. Observable market prices and
inputs available vary depending on the products and markets and are subject to changes based on specific events and
general conditions in the financial markets.

Where the Bank measures portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of net exposures, it applies judgment

in determining appropriate portfolio level adjustments such as bid-ask spread. Such judgments are derived from observable
bid-ask spreads for similar instruments and adjusted for factors specific to the portfolio.

98 Annual Report 2013African Development Bank Chapter 7
The following three hierarchical levels are used for the measurement of fair value:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant
inputs are based on observable market data. Included in this category are instruments valued using: quoted market prices
in active markets for similar instruments, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less
han active, or other valuation techniques where all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data.

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which significant input is not based on observable market data and the unobservable inputs
have a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation. Instruments that are valued based on quoted market prices for simiar instruments where significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the
instruments are included in this category.

The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety is determined on the
basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For this purpose, the significance
of an input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety. If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs
hat require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement. A valuation
input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if there is compelling
external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price.

 

The methods and assumptions used by the Bank in measuring the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Cash: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Borrowings: The fair values of the Bank’s borrowings are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques
based on discounted cash flow models using LIBOR market-determined discount curves adjusted by the Bank’s credit spread.
Credit spreads are obtained from market data as well as indicative quotations received from certain counterparties for the
Bank’s new public bond issues. The Bank also uses systems based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to value borrowings and their associated derivatives. The models use market-sourced inputs such as interest rates,
yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. Valuation models are subject to internal and periodic external reviews.
When a determination is made that the market for an existing borrowing is inactive or illiquid, appropriate adjustments are
made to the relevant observable market data to arrive at the Bank’s best measure of the price at which the Bank could have
sold the borrowing at the balance sheet date.

For borrowings on which the Bank has elected fair value option, the portion of fair value changes on the valuation of borrowings relating to the credit risk of the Bank is reported in Other Comprehensive Income in accordance with IFRS 9.

Equity Investments: The underlying assets of entities in which the Bank has equity investments are periodically fair valued
both by fund managers and independent valuation experts using market practices. The fair value of investments in listed
enterprises is based on the latest available quoted bid prices. The fair value of investments in unlisted entities is assessed
using appropriate methods, for example, discounted cash flows. The fair value of the Bank’s equity participations is measured as the Bank’s percentage ownership of the net asset value of the funds.

Derivative Financial Instruments: The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques that use market estimates of cash flows and discount rates. The Bank also uses valuation tools
based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to value derivative financial instruments. The models
use market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. All financial models
used for valuing the Bank's financial instruments are subject to both internal and periodic external reviews.

Annual Report 2013 99Chapter 7 African Development Bank

Loans: The Bank does not sell its sovereign loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for these loans. The Bank’s
loan assets, except for those at fair value, are carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost. The fair value of loans carried
at amortized cost are reported in these financial statements for disclosure purposes only and represents Management's best
measures of the present value of the expected cash flows of these loans. The fair valuation of loans has been measured using
a discounted cash flow model based on year-end market lending rates in the relevant currency including impairment, when
applicable, and credit spreads for non-sovereign loans. In arriving at its best estimate Management makes certain assumptions about the unobservable inputs to the model, the significant ones of which is the expected cash flows and the discount
rate. These are regularly assessed for reasonableness and impact on the fair value of loans. An increase in the level of forecast cash flows in subsequent periods would lead to an increase in the fair value and an increase in the discount rate used to
discount the forecast cash flows would lead to a decrease in the fair value of loans. Changes in fair value of loans carried at
fair value through profit and loss are reported in the income statement. The estimated fair value of loans is disclosed in Note |.

The fair value measurements of all qualifying treasury investments, borrowings, loans and equity investments are reported to
and reviewed by the Assets & Liabilities Committee (ALCO) in line with the Bank’s financial reporting policies.

Where third-party information from brokers or pricing experts are used to measure fair value, documents are independently
assessed and the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusions.

The assessment and documentation involves ensuring that (i) the broker or pricing service provider is duly approved for use
in pricing the relevant type of financial instrument, (ii) the fair value arrived at represents actual market transactions, (iii) where
prices for similar instruments have been adopted, that the same have been, where necessary, adjusted to reflect the characteristics of the instrument subject to measurement and where a number of quotes for the same financial instrument have
been obtained, fair value has been properly determined using those quotes.

The fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is based on fair value as defined under IFRS 13. A gain or loss may
only be recognized on initial recognition of a financial instrument if the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging) or
based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets. On initial recognition, a gain or
loss may not be recognized when using a fair value which is not defined under IFRS 13. The Bank only recognizes gains or
losses after initial recognition to the extent that they arise from a change in a factor (including time) that market participants
would consider in setting a price.

The Bank holds financial instruments, some maturing after more than ten years, where fair value is not based on quoted prices in an active market at the measurement date. Such financial instruments are initially recognized at the transaction price,
although the value obtained from the relevant market participants may differ. The difference between the transaction price
and the fair value measurement that is not evidenced by a quoted price in an active market or by a valuation technique that
uses only observable market data, commonly referred to as “day one profit and loss”, is either: (a) amortized over the life of
the transaction; or (6) deferred until the instrument's fair value can be measured using market observable inputs or is realized
through settlement. The financial instrument is subsequently measured at fair value, adjusted for the deferred day one profit
and loss. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognized immediately in the income statement without immediate reversal
of deferred day one profits and losses.

Under IAS 28, “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures”, the ADF and any other entity in which the Bank has significant influence are considered associates of the Bank. An associate is an entity over which the Bank has significant influence,
but not control, over the entity’s financial and operating policy decisions. The relationship between the Bank and the ADF is
described in more detail in Note J. IAS 28 requires that the equity method be used to account for investments in associates.
Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized at cost and the carrying amount is increased
or decreased to recognize the investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The investor's

100 Annual Report 2013African Development Bank Chapter 7

share of the profit or loss of the investee is recognized in the investor's income statement. The subscriptions by the Bank to
the capital of the ADF occurred between 1974 and 1990. At December 31, 2013, such subscriptions cumulatively represented less than 1 percent of the economic interest in the capital of the ADF.

Although ADF is a not-for-profit entity and has never distributed any dividend to its subscribers since its creation in 1972, IAS
28 require that the equity method be used to account for the Bank’s investment in the ADF. Furthermore, in accordance with
IAS 36, the net investment in the ADF is assessed for impairment. Cumulative losses as measured under the equity method
are limited to the investment’s original cost as the ADB has not guaranteed any potential losses of the ADF.

Property and equipment is measured at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or are recognized as a
separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to
the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement
when they are incurred.

Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to amortize the difference
between cost and estimated residual values over estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

¢ Buildings: 15-20 years

e Fixtures and fittings: 6-10 years

¢ Furniture and equipment: 3-7 years
¢ Motor vehicles: 5 years

The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed periodically and adjusted if appropriate. Assets that are subject to
amortization are reviewed annually for impairment. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable
amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher
of the asset's fair value less costs to disposal and its value in use. Gains and losses on disposal are determined as the difference between proceeds and the asset’s carrying amount and are included in the income statement in the period of disposal.

Intangible assets include computer systems software and are stated at historical cost less amortization. An intangible asset
is recognized only when its cost can be measured reliably and it is probable that the expected future economic benefits
attributable to it will flow to the Bank. Amortization of intangible assets is calculated using the straight-line method to write
down the cost of intangible assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives of 3-5 years.

The Bank has entered into several operating lease agreements, including those for its offices in Tunisia and in certain other member countries. Under such agreements, all the risks and benefits of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the
lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. When an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required
to be made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognized as an expense in the period in which the termination takes place.

In accordance with the Agreement establishing the Bank, the Board of Governors is the sole authority for approving allocations from income to surplus account or distributions to other entities for development purposes. Surplus consists of earnings from prior years which are retained by the Bank until further decision is made on their disposition or the conditions of
distribution for specified uses have been met. Distributions of income for development purposes are reported as expenses
on the Income Statement in the year of approval. Distributions of income for development purposes may be funded from
amounts previously transferred to surplus account or from the current year’s income.

Annual Report 2013 jO1Chapter 7 African Development Bank

Retained earnings of the Bank consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior years’ income, balance of amounts allocated to surplus after deducting distributions approved by the Board of Governors, unallocated current year’s net income,
and expenses recognized directly in equity as required by IFRS.

In the preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, Management makes certain estimates, assumptions and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are
based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances.

The most significant judgments and estimates are summarized below:

The Bank’s accounting policies require that assets and liabilities be designated at inception into different accounting categories. Such decisions require significant judgment and relate to the following circumstances:

Fair Value through Profit and Loss — In designating financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the Bank
has determined that such assets or liabilities meet the criteria for this classification.

Amortized Cost and Embedded Derivatives — The Bank follows the guidance of IFRS 9 on classifying financial assets and
those with embedded derivatives in their entirety as at amortized cost or fair value through profit or loss. In making this judgment, the Bank considers whether the cash flows of the financial asset are solely payment of principal and interest on the
principal outstanding and classifies the qualifying asset accordingly and those with embedded derivatives without separating the derivative.

Consolidation — The Bank follows the guidance of IFRS 10 in ascertaining if there are any entities that it controls, and that
may require consolidation.

The Bank also uses estimates for its financial statements in the following circumstances:

Impairment Losses on Financial Assets Measured at Amortized Cost — At each financial statements reporting date, the Bank
reviews its financial assets measured at amortized cost for impairment. The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence
of impairment exists for individual assets. If such objective evidence exists, impairment is determined by discounting expected future cash flows using the asset's original effective interest rate and comparing this amount to the asset’s net carrying
amount. Determining the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired assets requires significant judgment. If the
Bank determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed asset, that asset is included in
a group of assets with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Objective evidence of impairment for a group of assets may include observable data indicating that there has been an adverse change in the payment
status of borrowers in a group, or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets in the group.
Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfolio when scheduling its future cash flows. The methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amount and timing of future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences
between loss estimates and actual loss experience.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments — The fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets is measured
by using valuation techniques. Where valuation techniques (for example, models) are used to measure fair values, they are
validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All valuation models
are calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual data and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, valuation
models use only observable data; however, areas such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatilities and correlations
require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value

102 Annual Report 2013African Development Bank Chapter 7

of financial instruments. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires
judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. The determination of what constitutes ‘observable’ requires
significant judgment by the Bank.

Post-employment Benefits — The present value of retirement benefit obligations is sensitive to the actuarial and financial
assumptions used, including the discount rate. At the end of each year, the Bank determines the appropriate discount rate
and other variables to be used to determine the present value of estimated future pension obligations. The discount is based
on market yields at the end of the year of high-quality corporate bonds in the currencies comprising the Bank’s UA, and the
estimates for the other variables are based on the bank best judgment.

The financial statements are adjusted to reflect events that occurred between the balance sheet date and the date when the
financial statements are authorized for issue, provided they give evidence of conditions that existed at the balance sheet date.

Events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the balance sheet date are disclosed, but do not result in an adjustment of the financial statements themselves.

Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current year. These
reclassifications have no significant impact on previously reported result. Also, the application of the amendments to IAS 19
resulted in the restatement of the 2012 income statement and statement of other compressive income. As a result of the restatement, the net income previously reported for 2012 has been reduced by UA 2.90 million with a compensating increase of the
same amount in the other comprehensive income. Reserves as previously reported in the balance sheet remained unchanged.

At the date of issue of these financial statements, the following new and amended International Financial Reporting Standards
and Interpretations were effective for application by the Bank and have been applied in preparing these financial statements.
In addition the revisions to IAS 32 which becomes effective on January 1, 2014, have been early adopted by the Bank due
to their linkages with those in IFRS 7 which became effective on January 1, 2013.

IFRS 10 replaces the portion of IAS 27, “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements”, that addresses the accounting
for consolidated financial staternents. It introduces a new control model to determine whether an investee should be consolidated. This IFRS defines the principle of control and establishes control as the sole basis for determining which entities
should be consolidated by the reporting entity. It also establishes principles for the presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements when an entity has determined that it controls one or more other entities. Compared with the
requirements that were in IAS 27, the changes introduced by IFRS 10 require management to exercise significant judgment
to determine which entities are controlled, and therefore, are required to be consolidated by the Bank.

IFRS 10 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 but its adoption has no effect on the Bank’s
financial statements because, based on the control criteria, management does not consider that any entities with which the
Bank is involved, excluded from consolidation need to be included following the adoption of the new standard.

IFRS 12 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. IFRS 12 requires an entity to disclose information that enables users of financial statements to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, its interests in other
entities; and the effects of those interests on its financial position, financial performance and cash flows. IFRS 12 is required
to be applied by an entity that has an interest in any of the following entities: subsidiaries; joint arrangements; associates;
and unconsolidated structured entities. This standard requires disclosures of interests in subsidiaries and associates and

Annual Report 2013 ]03Chapter 7 African Development Bank

also expands the disclosure requirements for unconsolidated structured entities. The new disclosures also cover, among
other issues, judgments made in determining if the entity controlled, has joint control or significant influence over an entity.

Following the adoption of IFRS 10 an assessment, of the Bank's relationship with the African Development Fund (ADF) in
which it exercises a 50 percent voting power as stipulated in the Agreement establishing the Fund, was made for possible consolidation. The Agreement establishing the Fund also stipulates that in the event of termination of the ADF’s operations, the assets of the Fund shall be distributed pro-rata to its participants in proportion to the amounts paid-in by them
on account of their subscriptions, after settlement of any outstanding claims against the participants. As at December 31,
2013 the pro-rata share of the Bank in the net assets of ADF was 0.54 percent. Further the Bank does not derive any right
0 variable returns from its relationship with the ADF. Consequently, the ADF cannot be consolidated in the Bank’s financial
statements as the conditions for consolidation under IFRS 10 are not fully met. Detailed disclosure relating to the relationship
of the Bank to non-consolidated entities are presented in Note J of these financial statements.

The adoption of IFRS 12 has no significant impact on the Bank's financial position or performance as it only relates to disclosures.

FRS 13 defines fair value; sets out in a single IFRS a framework for measuring fair value; and requires disclosures about fair
value measurements.

FRS 13 explains how to measure fair value for financial reporting which is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific
measurement. It does not require fair value measurements in addition to those already required or permitted by other standards and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside financial reporting. However,
his standard expands the concepts and principles behind fair valuation. In addition, extensive disclosures about fair value
are required under IFRS 13, and in particular when an entity relies on unobservable valuation inputs under the “level 3” fair
valuation hierarchy.

 

FRS 13 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The Bank believes that there is no significant
impact of this standard on its financial position or performance. However, in response to the expanded disclosure requirements,
additional disclosures relating to information about the sensitivity of fair value measurements to changes in unobservable
estimation inputs and a detailed commentary on the Bank’s valuations methods and procedures have been provided in the
relevant Notes to these financial statements.

The amendments to IAS 19 are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The key changes in the
amended standard involve the elimination of the option to defer the recognition of actuarial gains and losses, known as the
‘corridor method’. Accordingly, under the amended standard, all actuarial gains and losses have to be recognized immediately in OCI. In addition, an entity is no longer able to recognize in profit or loss the long term expected return on assets
held and; past service costs are now recognized in profit or loss at the earlier of when the amendment occurs or when the
related restructuring or termination costs are recognized. Finally, the amended standard requires enhanced disclosures about
defined benefit plans, including quantitative sensitivity.

Other than the enhanced disclosures about defined benefit plans, the adoption of the amended IAS 19 will only affect the
Bank to the extent of the changes in the basis for determining the income or expense related to net defined benefit plans.
The Bank now determines this by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning
of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability (asset) at the beginning of the annual period, taking into account any
changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Previously
interest income or expense on plan assets was determined by the Bank based on their long-term rate of expected return.
As actuarial valuations are carried out annually, at the end of the year, the change in accounting policy had no impact on net
assets as at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013.

In accordance with the exception to retrospective application, provided for in the amendments, the Bank has opted not to

adjust the carrying amount of assets outside the scope of IAS 19 such as property, plant and equipment for changes in
employee benefit costs that were included in their carrying amount before the date of initial application.

104 Annual Report 2013African Development Bank Chapter 7

The application of the amendments to IAS 19 resulted in the restatement of the 2012 income statement and the statement
of other comprehensive income. As a result of the restatement, the 2012 net income was reduced by UA 2.90 million with
an increase of the same amount in other comprehensive income with no change to the previously reported reserves in the
2012 balance sheet.

n December 2011, IASB issued new disclosure requirements in respect of the effect of offsetting arrangements on an entiy’s financial position, as part of a common project with the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The new
requirements are set out in “Disclosures-Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (amendment to IFRS 7), and
are related to financial assets and liabilities that are offset in the statement of financial position or that are subject to master
netting arrangements or similar agreements. As part of the same project, the IASB also published “Disclosures-Offsetting
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (amendment to IAS 32) clarifying the offsetting criteria in IAS 32 to address inconsistency in their application.

The amendments to IFRS 7 are to be applied in the financial statements for the annual periods beginning on or after January 1,
2013 with those relating to IAS 32 being effective from annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014. The applicaion of the amendments relating to IFRS 7 revisions have no impact on the financial position or performance of the Bank
as the amendments primarily relate to disclosure and presentation of financial instruments and derivatives which are offset
in the statement of financial position or are part of an enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements. The
Bank has early adopted the revisions to IAS 32 but the application has no impact on the financial position of the Bank as
he amendments merely clarify the offsetting criteria and how these are to be applied in practice.

 

In carrying out its development mandate, the Bank seeks to maximize its capacity to assume core business risks resulting
from its lending and investing operations while at the same time minimizing its non-core business risks (market risk, counterparty risk, and operational risk) that are incidental but nevertheless critical to the execution of its mandate.

The highest level of risk management oversight in the Bank is assured by the Board of Executive Directors, which is chaired
by the President. The Board of Directors is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance. In addition to
approving all risk management policies, the Board of Directors regularly reviews trends in the Bank’s risk profiles and performance to ensure compliance with the underlying policies.

Three management level committees perform monitoring and oversight roles: the Asset and Liability Management Committee
(ALCO), the Credit Risk Committee (CRC) and the Operations Committee (OPSCOM). The ALCO is the oversight and control organ of the Bank’s finance and treasury risk management activities. It is the Bank’s most senior management forum on
finance and treasury risk management issues and is chaired by the Vice President for Finance. The Credit Risk Committee
(CRC) ensures effective implementation of the Bank’s credit policies and oversees all credit risk issues related to sovereign
and non-sovereign operations, prior to their submission to OPSCOM. OPSCOM is chaired by the First Vice President and
Chief Operating Officer and reviews all operational activities before they are submitted to the Board of Directors for approval.

The ALCO, CRC and OPSCOM meet on a regular basis to perform their respective oversight roles. Among other functions,
the ALCO reviews regular and ad-hoc finance and treasury risk management reports and financial projections and approves
proposed strategies to manage the Bank’s balance sheet. The Credit Risk Committee is responsible for end-to-end credit risk
governance, credit assessments, portfolio monitoring and rating change approval amongst other responsibilities. ALCO and
CRC are supported by several standing working groups that report on specific issues including country risk, non-sovereign
credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, operational risk, financial projections, and financial products and services.

Day-to-day operational responsibility for implementing the Bank’s financial and risk management policies and guidelines are
delegated to the appropriate business units. The Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the day
Annual Report 2013 j05Chapter 7 African Development Bank

to-day compliance with those policies and guidelines. In late 2013, a Group Chief Risk Officer position was created reporting
directly to the President of the Bank.

The degree of risk the Bank is willing to assume to achieve its development mandate is limited by its risk-bearing capacity.
This institutional risk appetite is embodied in the Bank’s capital adequacy policy and its commitment to maintain a prudent
risk profile consistent with the highest credit rating. The Bank allocates its risk capital between non-core risks (10 percent),
with sovereign and non-sovereign operations sharing equally the remaining balance (45 percent each).

The policies, processes and procedures by which the Bank manages its risk profile continually evolve in response to market, credit, product, and other developments. The guiding principles by which the Bank manages its risks are governed by
he Bank’s Capital Adequacy Policy, the General Authority on Asset Liability Management (the ALM Authority), the General
Authority on the Bank's Financial Products and Services (the FPS Authority) and the Bank’s Credit Risk Management Guidelines.

The ALM Authority is the overarching framework through which Management has been vested with the authority to manage
he Bank’s financial assets and liabilities within defined parameters. The ALM Authority sets out the guiding principles for
managing the Bank’s interest rate risk, currency exchange rate risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and operational
risk. The ALM Authority covers the Bank’s entire array of ALM activities such as debt-funding operations and investment of
iquid resources, including the interest rate and currency risk management aspects of the Bank’s lending and equity investment operations.

The FPS Authority provides the framework under which the Bank develops and implements financial products and services
or its borrowers and separate guidelines prescribe the rules governing the management of credit and operational risk for
he Bank's sovereign and non-sovereign loan, guarantee and equity investment portfolios.

Under the umbrella of the FPS Authority and the ALM Authority, the President is authorized to approve and amend more
detailed operational guidelines as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee
(ALCO), the Credit Risk Committee (CRC) and the Operations Committee (OPSCOM).

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the different sources of risk are managed by the Bank.
Credit risk arises from the inability or unwillingness of counterparties to discharge their financial obligations. It is the potential

or financial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk for the Bank arising
essentially from its lending and treasury operations.

 

The Bank manages three principal sources of credit risk: (i) sovereign credit risk in its public sector portfolio; (ii) non-sovereign credit risk in its portfolio of non-sovereign and enclave projects; and (iii) counterparty credit risk in its portfolio of treasury
investments and derivative transactions used for asset and liability management purposes. These risks are managed within an
integrated framework of credit policies, guidelines and processes, which are described in more detail in the sections that follow.

When the Bank lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the
borrowing member state. In extending credit to sovereign entities, the Bank is exposed to country risk which includes potential losses arising from a country’s inability or unwillingness to service its obligations to the Bank. The Bank manages country
credit risk through its policies related to the quality at entry of project proposals, exposure management, including individual
country exposures and overall creditworthiness of the concerned country. These include the assessment of the country’s
risk profile as determined by its macroeconomic performance, debt sustainability, socio-political conditions and the conduciveness of its business environment.

the split of the current state of Sudan into two separate nations became effective in July 2011, the number and amounts of loans shown against
Sudan in this statement would be split between the emerging states, on a basis agreed upon following the ongoing negotiations between the
North and South Sudan. At the end of December 2013, no decision has been taken by the states of the North and South Sudan regarding the
terms and conditions of such exchange.

Slight differences may occur in totals due to rounding.

The Bank is also exposed to some of its borrowers on account of trade finance and repayment guarantees for an amount
of UA 73.78 million of which UA 72.73 million relate to trade finance as at December 31, 2013.

The foundation of the Bank’s credit risk management is a systematic credit risk assessment framework, through underlying
models and their associated risk factors that have been optimized to ensure more predictive power of the rating parameters
and to better align with widely-used rating scales and ensure consistency with best practices. The credit risk assessment is
measured using a uniform internal 22-grade master scale, optimized to provide: (i) increased granularity; (ii) better differentiation between obligors; (iii) smoother grade distribution to alleviate the current grade concentration; and finally (iv) to create
a common framework when communicating credit risks to risks takers. The level of granularity helps in measuring probabilities of default in order to better differentiate between obligors.

108 Annual Report 2013African Development Bank Chapter 7

The credit ratings at the sovereign level are derived from a risk assessment of five risk indices that include macroeconomic
performance, debt sustainability, socio-political factors, business environment and the Bank’s portfolio performance. These
five risk indices are combined to derive a composite country risk index for both sovereign and non-sovereign portfolios. The
country risk ratings are validated against the average country risk ratings from different international rating agencies and
other specialized international organizations. The CRC reviews the country ratings on a quarterly basis to ensure that they
reflect the expected risk profiles of the countries. The CRC also assesses whether the countries are in compliance with their
country exposure limits and approves changes in loss provisioning, if required.

t is the Bank’s policy that if the payment of principal, interest or other charges with respect to any Bank Group credit becomes
80 days overdue, no new loans to that member country, or to any public sector borrower in that country, will be presented to
he Board of Directors for approval, nor will any previously approved loan be signed, until all arrears are cleared. Furthermore,
ior such countries, disbursements on all loans to or guaranteed by that member country are suspended until all overdue
amounts have been paid. These countries also become ineligible in the subsequent billing period for a waiver of 0.5% on
he commitment fees charged on qualifying undisbursed loans.

Although the Bank benefits from the advantages of its preferred creditor status and rigorously monitors the exposure on
non-performing sovereign borrowers, some countries have experienced difficulties in servicing their debts to the Bank on a
imely basis. As previously described, the Bank makes provisions for impairment on its sovereign loan portfolio commensurate with the assessment of the incurred loss in such portfolio.

To cover potential Expected Losses (EL) and Unexpected Losses (UL) related to credit, the Bank maintains a prudent risk
capital cushion for credit risks. The Bank’s capital adequacy policy articulates differentiated risk capital requirements for public
sector and private sector credit-sensitive assets (loans and equity investments), as well as for contingent liabilities (quaranees and client risk management products) in each risk class. Risk capital requirements are generally higher for private secor operations which have a higher probability of default and loss-given default than public sector operations. At the end of
December 2013, the Bank’s public sector loan portfolio used up to 27.7% percent of the Bank’s total risk capital based on
he Bank's capital adequacy framework. The Bank defines risk capital as the sum of paid-in capital net of exchange adjustments, plus accumulated reserves. Callable capital is not included in the computation of risk capital.

 

When the Bank lends to private sector borrowers and to enclave projects, it does not benefit from full sovereign guarantees.
The Bank may also provide financing to creditworthy commercially oriented entities that are publicly owned, without a sovereign guarantee.

To assess the credit risk of non-sovereign projects or facilities, the Bank uses several models to assess the risk of every project at entry. The models are tailored to the specific characteristics and nature of the transactions. The result of the credit
risk assessment is measured using a uniform internal 22-grade master scale as described above.

Non-sovereign transactions are grouped into the following three main categories: a) project finance; b) financial institutions;
and c) private equity funds. Internal credit ratings are derived on the basis of pre-determined critical factors.

The first factor involves the overall evaluation and assessment of the borrower's financial strength. This assesses:

Primarily, i) the capacity of the project to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt; ii) the company’s operating performance and profitability; and iii) the project company’s capital structure, financial flexibility and liquidity positions.

Secondly, the following, four main non-financial parameters are analyzed: i) the outlook of the industry in which the project
company operates; ii) the competitive position of the project company within the industry; iii) the strength of the project company’s management with particular emphasis on its ability to deal with adverse conditions; and iv) the quality of the information on which the analysis is based.

Finally, the project company’s risk rating is adjusted to reflect the overall host country risk rating.

The assessment of financial institutions follows the uniform rating system commonly referred to as the CAMELS model:
i) Capital adequacy — analyses of the composition, adequacy and quality of the institution’s capital; ii) Asset quality, operating policies and procedures and risk management framework; iii) Management quality and decision-making framework;
iv) Earnings and market position — an evaluation of the quality and level of profitability; v) Liquidity and funding adequacy — an
assessment focusing on the entity’s ability to access debt market; and vi) Sensitivity to market risk — an assessment of the
impact of interest rate changes and exchange rate fluctuations.

10 Annual Report 2013African Development Bank Chapter 7

The assessment of Private Equity Funds takes into consideration the analysis of the following qualitative and quantitative factors:

¢ Financial strength and historic fund performance;
¢ Investment strategy and risk management;

¢ Industry structure;

¢ Management and corporate governance; and

¢ Information quality.

All new non-sovereign projects require an initial credit rating and undergo a rigorous project approval process. The NonSovereign Working Group of the CRC reviews the non-sovereign credit rating of each project on a quarterly basis and may
recommend changes for approval by CRC if justified by evolving country and project conditions.

Since 2009, the Bank has been increasing its non-sovereign loan and equity exposures. The weighted-average risk rating
was 3.58 at the end of 2013 compared to 3.47 at the end of 2012. The distribution of the non-sovereign portfolio across

the Bank’s five credit risk classes is shown in the table below.

In compliance with IFRS, the Bank does not make general provisions to cover the expected losses in the performing nonsovereign portfolio. For the non-performing portfolio, the Bank makes a specific provision based on an assessment of the
credit impairment, or incurred loss, on each loan. At the end of 2013, the cumulative impairment allowance to cover the
incurred loss on impaired loan principal in the non-sovereign portfolio was UA 52.49 million compared to UA 34.96 million
at the end of 2012.

In addition to private sector lending, the Bank makes equity investments in private sector entities, either directly or through
investment funds.

To cover potential unexpected credit-related losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a risk
capital cushion for non-sovereign credit risks derived from Basel Il Advanced Internal Rating-Based Approach (IRB). At the
end of December 2013, the Bank’s non-sovereign portfolio required as risk capital approximately 28 percent of the Bank’s
total on-balance sheet risk capital sources. This level is still below the limit of 45 percent determined by the Bank for total
non-sovereign operations. Out of the Bank’s non-sovereign portfolio, equity participations consumed as risk capital, approximately 10.4 percent of the Bank’s total on-balance sheet risk capital sources. This is still below the statutory limit of 15 percent established by the Board of Governors for equity participations.

The Bank operates a system of exposure limits to ensure the maintenance of an adequately diversified portfolio at any given point in time. The Bank manages credit risk at the global country exposure limit (combined sovereign-guaranteed and
non-sovereign portfolios) by ensuring that in aggregate, the total exposure to any country does not exceed 15 percent of the
Bank’s total risk capital. This threshold and other determinants of country limit allocation are clearly spelt out in the Bank’s
capital adequacy framework.

Annual Report 2013 NlChapter 7 African Development Bank

n the revised capital adequacy and exposure management approved by the Board in May 2011, the 15 percent (of the Bank’s
otal risk capital) global country concentration limit is meant to allow for adequate portfolio diversification. However, in order
‘0 ensure that: (i) the allocation in aggregate does not exceed 100 percent of risk capital available for core lending activities,
and (ii) there is fairness of allocation among RMCs, a Performance-Based Adjusted Country Limits formula (PACL) is used.

The credit exposure on the non-sovereign portfolio is further managed by regularly monitoring the exposure limit with regard
‘0 the specific industry/sectors, equity investments and single obligor. In addition, the Bank generally requires a range of
collateral (security and/or guarantees) from project sponsors to partially mitigate the credit risk for direct private sector loans.

n the normal course of business, and beyond its development related exposures, the Bank utilizes various financial instruments to meet the needs of its borrowers, manage its exposure to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates, and
‘o temporarily invest its liquid resources prior to disbursement. All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees,
he risk that the counterparty to the transaction may be unable to meet its obligation to the Bank. Given the nature of the
Bank's business, it is not possible to completely eliminate counterparty credit risk; however, the Bank minimizes this risk by
executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating standards, counerparty exposure limits, and counterparty credit risk mitigation measures.

Counterparties must meet the Bank’s minimum credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank’s Vice President
or Finance. For local currency operations, less stringent minimum credit rating limits are permitted in order to provide adequate availability of investment opportunities and derivative counterparties for implementing appropriate risk management
strategies. The ALCO approves counterparties that are rated below the minimum rating requirements.

 

Counterparties are classified as investment counterparties, derivative counterparties, and trading counterparties. Their ratings are closely monitored for compliance with established criteria.

For trading counterparties, the Bank requires a minimum short-term credit rating of A-2/P-2/F-2 for trades settled under
delivery vs. payment (DVP) terms and a minimum long-term credit rating of A/A2 for non DVP-based transactions.

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

Also, the maximum weighted average life for all ABS/MBS at the time of acquisition shall
not exceed 5 years.

The Bank may also invest in money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3 and enters into collateralized
securities repurchase agreements.

The Bank uses derivatives in the management of its borrowing portfolio and for asset and liability management purposes.
As a rule, the Bank executes an ISDA master agreement and netting agreement with its derivative counterparties prior to
undertaking any transactions. Derivative counterparties are required to be rated AA-/Aa3 by at least two approved rating
agencies or A-/A3 for counterparties with whom the Bank has entered into a collateral exchange agreement. Lower rated
counterparties may be used exceptionally for local currency transactions. These counterparties require the approval of ALCO.
Approved transactions with derivative counterparties include swaps, forwards, options and other over-the-counter derivatives.

In addition to the minimum rating requirements for derivative counterparties, the Bank operates within a framework of exposure limits to different counterparties based on their credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 12 percent of the Bank’s
total risk capital (equity and reserves) for any single counterparty. Individual counterparty credit exposures are aggregated
across all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) potential future exposure methodology and monitored regularly against the Bank’s credit limits after considering the benefits of any collateral.

Annual Report 2013 113Chapter 7 African Development Bank
The credit exposure of the investment and related derivative portfolios continues to be dominated by highly rated counter
parties as shown in the table below. The proportion of exposure to AAA-rated entities decreased from the previous year as
a result of the downgrade of some agencies.

The Bank's exposure to the stressed Eurozone economies remains limited to approximately UA 25 million or less than 1 percent of the portfolio.

To cover potential unexpected credit losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a conservative
risk capital cushion for counterparty credit risks in line with the current BIS standards. At the end of December 2013, the
Bank’s counterparty credit portfolio including all investments and derivative instruments required as risk capital 1.4 percent
of the Bank’s total on-balance sheet risk capital sources.

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. Liquidity
risk arises when there is a maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities. The Bank’s principal liquidity risk management
objective is to hold sufficient liquid resources to enable it to meet all probable cash flow needs for a rolling 1-year horizon
without additional financing from the capital markets for an extended period. In order to minimize this risk, the Bank maintains a prudential minimum level of liquidity (PML) based on the projected net cash requirement for a rolling one-year period.
The PML is updated quarterly and computed as the sum of four components: 1) 1-year debt service payments; 2) 1-year
projected net loan disbursements (loans disbursed less repayments) if greater than zero; 3) loan equivalent value of committed guarantees; and 4) undisbursed equity investments.

To strike a balance between generating adequate investment returns and holding securities that can be easily sold for cash if
required, the Bank divides its investment portfolio into tranches with different liquidity objectives and benchmarks. The Bank’s
core liquidity portfolio (operational portfolio) is invested in highly liquid securities that can be readily liquidated if required to
meet the Bank’s short term liquidity needs. Probable redemptions of swaps and borrowings with embedded options are
included in the computation of the size of the operational tranche of liquidity. In addition to the core liquidity portfolio, the
Bank maintains a second tranche of liquidity (the prudential portfolio) that is also invested in relatively liquid securities to cover its expected medium-term operational cash flow needs. A third tranche of liquidity, which is funded by the Bank’s equity
resources, is held in a portfolio of fixed income securities intended to collect contractual cash flows with the objective of
stabilizing the Bank’s net income. In determining its level of liquidity for compliance with the PML, the Bank includes cash,
deposits and securities in all the treasury investments, with appropriate hair-cuts based on asset class and credit rating.

Annual Report 2013 115Chapter 7 African Development Bank

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. To promote stable growth
in its risk-bearing capacity, the Bank’s principal currency risk management objective is to protect its risk capital from translaion risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by matching the currency composition of its net assets to the
currency composition of the SDR (UA). The agreement establishing the Bank explicitly prohibits it from taking direct currency exchange exposures by requiring liabilities in any one currency to be matched with assets in the same currency. This is
achieved primarily by holding or lending the proceeds of its borrowings (after swap activities) in the same currencies in which
hey were borrowed (after swap activities). To avoid creating new currency mismatches, the Bank requires its borrowers to
service their loans in the currencies disbursed.

Because a large part of its balance sheet is funded by equity resources, which are reported in Units of Account (equivalent
‘0 the SDR), the Bank has a net asset position that is potentially exposed to translation risk when currency exchange rates
luctuate. The Bank’s policy is to minimize the potential fluctuation of the value of its net worth measured in Units of Account
by matching, to the extent possible, the currency composition of its net assets with the currency basket of the SDR (the
Unit of Account). In keeping with the Bank’s currency risk management policy, spot currency transactions are carried out to
realign the net assets to the SDR basket each time there is a misalignment or when there is a revision to the SDR currency
composition.

 

The Bank also hedges its exposure to adverse movements on currency exchange rates on its administrative expenses. The
distribution of the currencies of the Bank’s recurring administrative expenditures shows a high concentration of expenses in
Euros, US Dollars and Tunisian Dinar.

As described in the previous section, the Bank manages its currency risk exposure by matching, to the extent possible, the
currency composition of its net assets with the currency basket of the SDR. The SDR is composed of a basket of four currencies, namely the US dollar, Euro, Japanese yen and Pound sterling. The weight of each currency in the basket is determined and reviewed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) every five years and the last revision became effective on
January 1, 2011 based on the value of exports of goods and services and international reserves. The SDR rate represents

118 Annual Report 2013African Development Bank Chapter 7

the sum of specific amounts of the four basket currencies valued in U.S dollars, on the basis of the exchange rates quoted
at noon each day in the London market.

Currency risks arise with the uncertainty about the potential future movement of the exchange rates between these currencies on the one hand, and between the exchange rates of the SDR currencies and the other non-SDR currencies (mainly
African currencies) used by the Bank on the other hand. In this regard, the Bank carries out an annual sensitivity analysis of
the translation results of its net assets with regard to the movement of the different exchange rates. The analysis consists of
a set of scenarios where the exchange rates between the US dollar and the other SDR and African currencies are stretched
out by large margins (10 percent appreciation/depreciation).

The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of the Bank’s net assets to currency fluctuations due to movements in the exchange
rate of the currencies in the SDR basket as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The sensitivity analysis shown
assumes a separate 10 percent appreciation/depreciation for each currency in the basket against the US dollar. Due to a
moderate change in the African currency holdings the table also includes the effect of a 10 percent appreciation/depreciation of each African currency against the SDR. Under the different scenarios, the currency risk management strategy of the
Bank shows a minimal change in net assets as a result of currency mismatches.

The Bank's interest rate risk sensitivity is comprised of the following two elements:

1) the sensitivity of the interest margin between the rate the Bank earns on its assets and the cost of the borrowings funding such assets;

2) the sensitivity of the income on assets funded by equity resources to changes in interest rates.

The Bank’s principal interest rate risk management objective is to generate a stable overall net interest margin that is not
overly sensitive to sharp changes in market interest rates, but yet adequately responsive to general market trends.

Annual Report 2013African Development Bank Chapter 7

Two thirds of the Bank's interest-rate-sensitive assets are funded by debt. The Bank seeks to generate a stable net interest
margin on assets funded by debt by matching the interest rate characteristics of each class of assets with those of the corresponding liabilities.

In 1990, the Bank began offering “variable rate” loans. The interest rate on these loans resets semi-annually based on the
average cost of a dedicated pool of the Bank’s borrowings. These pools are funded with a mix of fixed rate and floating rate
borrowings to provide borrowers with broadly stable interest rates that gradually track changes in market interest rates. The
cost of funds pass-through formulation incorporated in the lending rates charged on the Bank’s pool-based loans has traditionally helped to minimize the interest rate sensitivity of the net interest margin on this part of its loan portfolio. In view of
declining demand for this product in favor of market-based loans, the Bank is carefully managing the gradual winding down
of the designated funding pools.

Since 1997, the Bank offers fixed and floating rate loans whose interest rate is directly linked to market interest rates
(market-based loans). For the market-based loan products, the Bank’s net interest margin is preserved by using swaps to
align the interest rate sensitivity of the loans with that of the Bank’s underlying funding reference (six-month Libor floating
rate). The Bank may also provide borrowers with risk management products such as swaps to modify the currency and
interest rate terms of its market-based loan products. Although it retains the credit risks of the borrower, the Bank eliminates
the associated market risk on these risk management products by simultaneously laying off market risks with an approved
derivative counterparty.

For the portfolio of liquid assets funded by borrowings, the Bank protects its net interest margin by managing its investments
within limits around benchmarks that replicate the interest rate characteristics of the underlying funding for each portfolio
tranche. The portfolio of liquid assets funded by borrowings is currently divided into two tranches to reflect the different business purposes and underlying funding. The core part of the investment portfolio is held to comply with the Bank’s liquidity
policy and uses a six-month Libor floating rate benchmark. The operational liquidity portfolio is managed to meet projected
operational cash flow needs and uses a one-month Libor floating rate benchmark.

The Bank diversifies the sources of its funding by issuing debt in a variety of markets and instruments. Unless fixed rate funding
is required for one of its pool-based loan products, the Bank protects its net interest margin by simultaneously swapping all
new borrowings into floating rate in one of the Bank’s active currencies on a standard six-month Libor rate reference. Where
the Bank issues structured debt, the Bank simultaneously enters into a swap with matching terms to synthetically create the
desired six-month Libor-based floating rate funding. For risk management purposes, callable funding is considered as one
alternative to issuing short-term debt such as Euro Commercial Paper. The Bank manages refinancing risk by: (i) limiting the
amount of debt that will mature or is potentially callable within one year to 25 percent of the outstanding debt portfolio, and
(ii) trying to match the average maturity of loans priced with a fixed spread with borrowing with similar lifetime.

The second principal source of interest rate risk is the interest rate sensitivity of the income earned from funding a significant
portion of the Bank's assets with equity resources. These assets are mostly made up of fixed rate loans and investments with
a lifetime of 10 years. Changes in market interest rates in the currencies of the Bank’s equity resources (the SDR) affect the
net interest margin earned on assets funded by equity. In general, lower nominal market interest rates result in lower lending
and investment rates, which in the long-term reduce the nominal earnings on the Bank’s equity resources.

The Bank manages the interest rate profile of the assets funded by equity resources with the objective of reducing the sensitivity of the net interest margin to fluctuations in market interest rates. This is achieved by continuously adjusting the repricing profile of the assets funded by the Bank’s equity resources (fixed rate loans and investments) to match a repricing profile
benchmark. The Bank’s repricing profile benchmark is a 10-year ladder whereby a uniform 10 percent of the Bank’s assets
is funded by equity and repriced in each year. Using this benchmark, the Bank’s net interest margin on assets funded by
equity tends to track a 10-year moving average of 10-year maturity SDR interest rates.

At the end of 2012 and 2013, the Bank's overall repricing profile was closely aligned to the benchmark in almost all annual
buckets.

Annual Report 2013 ]23Chapter 7 African Development Bank

A parallel upward shift in the SDR curve of 100 bps would have generated a maximum gain in income statement of UA 5.66
million and UA 5.67 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Movements in interest rates also have an impact on the values of assets and liabilities that are reported in the financial statements at fair value through profit or loss. The table below shows the effect of a parallel yield curve movement of +/- 100 bps
of each of the currencies in the investment portfolio and the borrowings and derivative portfolios as of December 31, 2013
and 2012, respectively. However, due to the low level of interest rates across the Japanese Yen yield curve, the sensitivity
analysis in 2013 and 2012 for assets and liabilities denominated in Japanese Yen reflect a parallel movement in the yield
curve of +/- 10 bps.

In addition to the two principal sources of interest rate risk described above, the Bank is exposed to prepayment risk on
loans committed before 1997 on which the Bank is unable to charge a prepayment penalty. In practice the level of prepayments on such loans has generally been within acceptable levels. For all market-based loans issued since 1997, the Bank
protects itself from prepayment risk by linking the prepayment penalty to the cost of redeploying the funds at current market rates. Since 2006, total annual prepayments on loans particularly those committed prior to 1997 have been declining
over the years. Prepayments in 2013 amounted to UA 96.73 million (2012: UA 21.71 million) none of which relate to loans
committed prior to 1997.

Like all financial institutions, the Bank is exposed to operational risks arising from its systems and processes.

Operational risks include the risks of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and/or systems,
and from external events which could have a negative financial or adverse reputational impact. Operational risk is present
in virtually all the Bank’s transactions and includes losses attributable to failures of internal processes in credit and market
operations.

The Internal Control Unit (ICU) of the Bank is responsible for implementing the Integrated Internal Control Framework (IICF)
which consists of two phases. Phase one relates to the implementation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR)
based on the COSO Framework as a means of regularly evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of the Bank’s internal
controls in all significant business processes with financial statement impact. As part of this process, Management's attestation on the adequacy of internal controls over financial reporting is published in the Bank’s annual report.

Phase two of the IICF entails the implementation of Operational Risk Management Framework which is intended to address
risks inherent in other business processes not covered by ICFR. The Operational Risk Management Framework (ORM) was
approved by the Board of Directors in March 2012 as the first step in addressing risks related to business processes and
the implementation process is ongoing. Full implementation of ORM will ensure a structured and well-coordinated approach
to risk identification and assessment, risk mitigation and control as well as risk reporting across the Bank. It will also provide
the basis for applying advanced measurement approach in measuring operational risk capital. Currently, the Bank’s Capital
Adequacy and Exposure Management Framework provides for an operational risk capital charge of 15 percent of the average operating income for the preceding 3 years, in line with Basel II recommendations for operational risk.

124 Annual Report 2013African Development Bank Chapter 7

It is the primary responsibility of the management of each business unit to implement adequate controls in their respective
business processes based on the prevailing institutional standards.

Compliance with institutional standards is verified through periodic reviews undertaken by the Office of the Auditor General
of the Bank. The results of internal audit reviews are discussed with the Management of the relevant business unit(s), with
summaries submitted to Senior Management of the Bank and the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.

The Bank also has a contingency and business continuity plan which aims to ensure the continuity of its operations and protect the interests of all the key stakeholders of the Bank Group, namely, the member countries (borrowing and non-borrowing),
bondholders and other creditors as well as employees and their families, in the event of any disturbance in its office locations. Three key organs in the Bank ensure the oversight and implementation of the plan: (i) the Executive Crisis Committee,
chaired by the President of the Bank, which makes the key decisions based on recommendations from the Operations Crisis
Committee (OCC); (ii) the OCC, chaired by the Corporate Vice President, that closely monitors all developments affecting
the Bank and advises on measures necessary to mitigate the relevant risks; and (iii) the business continuity Unit (BCPU) that
follows up on the implementation of decisions made and is also responsible for periodic tests of the overall business continuity preparedness of the Bank and staff.

Other elements of the Bank’s operational risk management practices include compliance with the Code of conduct and staff
rules, the work of the Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department (IACD) and the existence of a Whistleblower Protection Policy.

The Bank’s policy is to recognize transfers out of level 3 as of the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused
the transfer.

Investments whose values are based on quoted market prices in active markets, and are therefore classified within Level 1,
include active listed equities, exchange-traded derivatives, US government treasury bills and certain non-US sovereign obligations. The Bank does not adjust the quoted price for these instruments.

126 Annual Report 2013African Development Bank Chapter 7

Financial instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but are valued based on quoted market prices,
dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs are classified within Level 2. These include
investment-grade corporate bonds and certain non-US sovereign obligations, listed equities over-the-counter derivatives
and a convertible loan. As Level 2 investments include positions that are not traded in active markets and/or are subject to
transfer restrictions, valuations may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, which are generally based on
available market information.

Investments classified within Level 3 have significant unobservable inputs, as they trade infrequently or do not trade at all.
Instruments in Level 3 include loans to Regional Member Countries, private equity and corporate debt securities including
some structured asset and mortgage-backed instruments. As observable prices are not available for these securities, the
Bank has used valuation techniques to derive the fair value. However as noted earlier, the fair values for loans and some
securities are derived merely for disclosure purposes rather than for reporting on the balance sheet.

The primary products classified at Level 3 are as follows:

Due to the lack of liquidity in the market and the prolonged period of time under which many securities have not traded,
obtaining external prices is not a strong enough measure to determine whether an asset has an observable price or not.
Therefore, once external pricing has been verified, an assessment is made whether each security is traded with significant
liquidity based on its credit rating and sector. If a security is of low credit rating and/or is traded in a less liquid sector, it will
be classified as Level 3. Where third party pricing is not available, the valuation of the security will be estimated from market
standard cash flow models with input parameter assumptions which include prepayment speeds, default rates, discount
margins derived from comparable securities with similar vintage, collateral type, and credit ratings. These securities are also
classified as Level 3.

The fair value of investments in unlisted entities is assessed using appropriate methods, for example, discounted cash flows
or net asset value (NAV). The fair value of the Bank’s equity participations is estimated as the Bank’s percentage ownership
of the net asset value of the investments.

Trading derivatives are classified at Level 3 if there are parameters which are unobservable in the market, such as products
where the performance is linked to more than one underlying. Examples are derivative transactions and derivatives attached
to local currency transactions. These unobservable correlation parameters could only be implied from the market, through
methods such as historical analysis and comparison to historical levels or benchmark data.

The table below shows the valuation techniques used in the determination of fair values for financial assets within level 3 of
the measurement hierarchy as well as the key unobservable inputs used in the valuation models. The Bank has determined
that market participants would use the same inputs in pricing the financial instruments. Management considers that changing the unobservable inputs described below to reflect other reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not result
in a significant change in the estimated fair value.

Although the Bank believes that its estimates of fair value are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions
could lead to different fair value results.

The valuation techniques applied with significant unobservable inputs are described briefly below:

Comparable pricing refers to the method where valuation is done by calculating an implied yield from the price of a similar
comparable observable instrument. The comparable instrument for a private equity investment is a comparable listed company. The comparable instrument in case of bonds is a similar comparable but observable bond. This may involve adjusting
the yield to derive a value for the unobservable instrument.

Yield is the interest rate that is used to discount the future cash-flows in a discounted cash-flow model.

Correlation is the measure of how movement in one variable influences the movement in another variable. Credit correlation generally refers to the factor that describes the relationship between the probability of individual entities to default on
obligations and the joint probability of multiple entities to default on obligations. Similarly, equity correlation is the correlation
between two equity instruments. An interest rate correlation refers to the correlation between two swap rates. FX correlation
represents the correlation between two different exchange rates.

A liquidity discount is primarily applied to unlisted firms to reflect the fact that these stocks are not actively traded. An increase
in liquidity discount in isolation will result in unfavourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm.

Annual Report 2013 ]29Chapter 7 African Development Bank

Volatility represents an estimate of how much a particular instrument, parameter or Index will change in value over time.

Volatilities are generally implied from the observed option prices. For certain instruments, volatility may change with strike
and maturity profile of the option.

Credit Spreads represent the additional yield that a market participant would demand for accepting an exposure to the credit
risk of an instrument. A change in the assumptions could lead to different fair value results.

For fair value measurements in level 3, changing one or more of the assumptions used would have the following effects:

The fair value of level 3 investments is sensitive to sources of pricing used. The fair value variance arising from using other
sources of prices amounted to UA 0.25 million or 0.14 percent.

The table below shows the effect of a parallel yield curve movement of +/- 100 bps of each of the currencies in the level 3
borrowings and derivative portfolios as of December 31, 2013. However, due to the low level of interest rates across the
Japanese Yen yield curve, the sensitivity analysis in 2013 for liabilities denominated in Japanese Yen reflect a parallel movement in the yield curve of +/- 10 bps:

The Bank has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert fixed rate income on loans in certain currencies into variable rate income.

The Bank has entered into futures contracts to hedge fixed interest rate bonds against interest rate variations. As at December 31,
2013, the Bank had 1,947 contracts in Euro and 8,961 contracts in US Dollars. The nominal value of each contract is one
million of each currency unit, except for 60 contracts with a nominal value of Euro 100,000 for each contract.

To insulate the Bank from possible significant increases in administrative expenses that could arise from an appreciation of
the principal currencies of administrative expenditure i.e. EUR, GBP, TND and USD vis-a-vis the UA, the Bank executed forward exchange transactions to economically hedge its administrative expenses. As at December 31, 2013 there were no
open positions with respect to forward exchange transactions.

The Bank applies fair value hedge accounting to interest rate swaps contracted to hedge its interest rate risk exposure associated to fixed rate loans. Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instruments are recognized in profit or loss. The
hedged item is adjusted to reflect changes in its fair value in respect of the risk being hedged with the gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk being recognized in profit or loss.

The fair value of the loan swaps designated and effective as hedging instruments as at December 31, 2013 was a liability of
UA 67.74 million. The fair value gain on these loan swaps for the period ended December 31, 2013 was UA 60.62 million.
The fair value loss on the hedged loans attributable to the hedged risk was UA 62.44 million. Therefore, the hedge ineffectiveness recognized in profit or loss was a loss of UA 1.82 million.

Hedge accounting treatment for swaps at the designation date requires the amortization of the difference between the net

carrying amount of loans and their fair value from inception. For 2013, the amortization of fair value adjustment on the hedged
risk amounted to UA 5.19 million.

Prior to May 1981, all payments in respect of paid-up capital had been made in convertible currencies. However, for the
capital increases authorized in May 1979 (but effective December 1982) and May 1981, regional members had the following
two options for making their payments:

1) Five (5) equal annual installments, of which at least 50 percent is payable in convertible currency and the remainder in
local currency; or

2) Five (6) equal annual installments, of which 20 percent is payable in convertible currency and 80 percent in non-negotiable,
non-interest-bearing notes. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in installments commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

Non-regional members were required to make their payments solely in convertible currencies.

The paid-up portion of subscriptions, authorized in accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolution B/BG/87/11 relating to
the Fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), is to be paid as follows:

1) Regional Members — 50 percent in five (5) equal annual installments in cash in freely convertible currency or freely convertible currencies selected by the member state, and 50 percent by the deposit of five non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing
notes of equal value denominated in Units of Account. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency
in five (6) equal annual installments commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

2) Non-Regional Members - five (6) equal annual installments in their national currencies, where such currencies are freely
convertible or in notes denominated in freely convertible currencies encashable on demand.

Under the Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V), there is no distinction in the payment arrangements between regional and
non-regional members. Each member is required to pay for the paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in eight (8) equal and
consecutive annual installments. The first installments shall be paid in cash and in a freely convertible currency. The second
to the eighth installments shall be paid in cash or notes encashable on demand in a freely convertible currency.

Under the Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI), approved in accordance with the Board of Governors’ Resolution B/
BG/2010/08 of May 27, 2010 each member eligible to receive financing exclusively from the African Development Fund only
shall pay for the paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in twelve (12) equal and consecutive annual installments; while
Middle Income Countries, Blend countries and Non-Regional Member Countries shall pay for the paid-up portion of their
respective subscribed shares in eight (8) equal and consecutive annual installments.

Payments for shares under GCI-VI are to be made in freely convertible currencies in cash or promissory notes encashable
on or before the due date for payment.

At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the non-negotiable notes balances were as follows:

Annual Report 2013 135Chapter 7 African Development Bank

The Bank’s loan portfolio comprises loans granted to, or guaranteed by borrowing member countries as well as certain
other non-sovereign-guaranteed loans. Amounts disbursed on loans are repayable in the currency or currencies disbursed
by the Bank or in other freely convertible currency or currencies approved by the Bank. The amount repayable in each of
these currencies shall be equal to the amount disbursed in the original currency. Loans are granted for a maximum period of
twenty years, including a grace period, which is typically the period of project implementation. Loans are for the purpose of
financing development projects and programs, and are not intended for sale. Furthermore, management does not believe
there is a comparable secondary market for the type of loans made by the Bank.

The types of loans currently held by the Bank and the rates charged are described below:

Loan Portfolio: The Bank’s loan portfolio is currently made up of three primary types of loans based on the financial
terms: fixed rate, floating rate and variable rate loans. Fixed rate and variable rate loans have both multicurrency and
single currency terms — that is, offered in multicurrency or in a single currency. While floating rate loans only bear single
currency terms.

Others loans: The Bank also offers parallel co-financing and A/B loan syndications. Through syndications the Bank is
able to mobilize co-financing by transferring some or all of the risks associated with its loans and guarantees to other
financing partners. Thus, syndications decrease and diversify the risk profile of the Bank’s financing portfolio. Syndications
may be on a funded or unfunded basis, and they may be arranged on an individual, portfolio, or any other basis consistent with industry practices.

The Bank also offers its RMCs local currency loans if the Bank is able to fund efficiently in the local currency market. The
local currency loans are offered under the fixed spread loan pricing framework with a “cost-pass-through” principle for local

currency loans to ensure that the overall cost of funds is compensated.

In 2012, the Bank disbursed a loan that is measured at FVTPL due to the existence of a conversion option in the loan that
could potentially change the future cash flows to no longer represent solely payments of principal and interest as required
by IFRS 9. The fair value of this loan has been determined using the expected cash flows model with inputs including interest rates and the borrower's credit spread which was estimated based on the Bank’s internal rating methodology for nonsovereign loans.

The ADF was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the Bank in contributing to the economic and social

countries, and to provide financing on highly concessional terms for such purposes. The Fund's original subscriptions were
provided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the ADF Agreement, and State Participants acceding to the
Agreement since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the form of
Special General Increases and General Replenishments.

The ADF has a 14-member Board of Directors, made up of 7 members selected by the African Development Bank and 7
members selected by State Participants. The Fund’s Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors made up of representatives of the State Participants and the ADB. The President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

To carry out its functions, the Fund utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank, for which it pays
a share of the administrative expenses. The share of administrative expenses paid by the Fund to the Bank is calculated
annually on the basis of a cost-sharing formula, approved by the Board of Directors, which is driven in large part by the
number of programs and projects executed during the period. Based on the cost-sharing formula, the share of administraive expenses incurred by ADF for the year ended December 31, 2013 amounted to UA 225.87 million (2012: UA 185.27
million), representing 68.69 percent (2012: 65.91 percent) of the shareable administrative expenses incurred by the Bank.
The accounts of the ADF are kept separate and distinct from those of the Bank.

 

AO Annual Report 2013African Development Bank Chapter 7

Although the ADB by agreement exercises 50 percent of the voting powers in the ADF, the Agreement establishing the ADF
also provides that in the event of termination of the ADF’s operations, the assets of the Fund shall be distributed pro-rata to
its participants in proportion to the amounts paid-in by them on account of their subscriptions, after settlement of any outstanding claims against the participants. At December 31, 2013, the Bank’s pro-rata or economic share in ADF was 0.54
percent (2012: 0.58 percent).

Notwithstanding the exercise of 50 percent voting power in the Fund by the Bank, the conditions for control under IFRS
10 Consolidated Financial Statements are not met since the Bank does not have absolute voting interest to control ADF,
no rights to variable returns from its relationship with ADF and has an economic interest of less than 1 percent in the Fund.
Consequently, the Fund cannot be consolidated in the Bank’s Financial Statements.

As a result of the implementation in 2006 of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative described in Note V-2, the net asset value of
ADF which is the basis for determining the value of the Bank's investment in the Fund declined, resulting in impairment loss
on the Bank’s investment. The net assets of ADF is made up of its net development resources less outstanding demand
obligations plus disbursed and outstanding loans excluding balances due from countries that have reached their HIPC completion points and, are therefore due for MDRI loan cancelation at the balance sheet date.

The Bank may take equity positions in privately owned productive enterprises and financial intermediaries, public sector companies that are in the process of being privatized or regional and sub-regional institutions. The Bank’s objective in such equity
investments is to promote the economic development of its Regional Member Countries and in particular the development
of their private sectors. The Bank’s equity participation is also intended to promote efficient use of resources, promoting
African participation, playing a catalytic role in attracting other investors and lenders and mobilizing the flow of domestic and
external resources to financially viable projects, which also have significant economic merit.

Unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors, the Bank’s equity participation shall not exceed 25 percent of the equity
capital of the entity in which it invests. The Bank does not seek a controlling interest in the companies in which it invests, but
closely monitors its equity investments through Board representation. In accordance with the Board of Governors’ Resolution
B/BG/2009/10 of May 13, 2009, total equity investment by the Bank shall not at any time exceed 15 percent of the aggregate amount of the Bank’s paid-in capital and reserves and surplus (risk capital) included in its ordinary capital resources.

Under IFRS 9 equity investments must be measured at fair value through profit or loss. However, where the equity investment is not held for trading, an entity has the option to take fair value changes into other comprehensive income (OCI), with
no recycling of the change in fair value to profit or loss if the investment is subsequently derecognized. As the Bank’s equity
investments are currently held for strategic purposes of enhancing development in Regional Member Countries rather than
for trading, the Bank has opted to designate all its equity investments as at fair value through other comprehensive income.

Under the Headquarters Agreement with Cédte d’lvoire, the Government granted to the Bank land for purposes of erecting
a building to serve for the business of the Bank only. The Bank was given unlimited right of occupancy on this land, which
remains the property of the Government. If the Bank transfers its headquarters from Céte d'Ivoire or otherwise gives up the
use of the lands and buildings, these would have to be surrendered to the Host Country. The Government would then pay
the Bank the value of the buildings as assessed at the time of the surrender. Therefore, the Bank cannot transfer the rights
on the properties to a third party.

As at December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Bank’s borrowings were as follows:

 

(UA millions)

2013 2012
Borrowings at fair value 12,127.91 12,175.96
Borrowings at amortized cost 819.53 1,102.84
Total 12,947.44 13,278.80

The Bank’s borrowings as at December 31, 2013 included subordinated borrowings in the amount of UA 462.20 million
(2012: UA 760.80 million).

The capital adequacy framework approved by the Board of Directors adopted the use of a single debt to usable capital ratio
to monitor the Bank’s leverage. The ratio caps the Bank’s total outstanding debt at 100 percent of usable capital. Usable
capital comprises the equity of the Bank and the callable capital of its non-borrowing members rated A- or better. The Bank’s
usable capital at December 31, 2013 was UA 27.09 billion.

144 Annual Report 2013African Development Bank Chapter 7

The Bank uses derivatives in its borrowing and liability management activities to take advantage of cost-saving opportunities and to lower its funding costs.

Certain long-term borrowing agreements contain provisions that allow redemption at the option of the holder at specified
dates prior to maturity. Such borrowings are reflected in the tables on the maturity structure of borrowings using the put
dates, rather than the contractual maturities. Management believes, however, that a portion of such borrowings may remain
outstanding beyond their earliest indicated redemption dates.

The Bank has entered into cross-currency swap agreements with major international banks through which proceeds from
borrowings are converted into a different currency and include a forward exchange contract providing for the future exchange
of the two currencies in order to recover the currency converted. The Bank has also entered into interest rate swaps, which
transform a floating rate payment obligation in a particular currency into a fixed rate payment obligation or vice-versa.

A summary of the Bank’s borrowings portfolio at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was as follows:

The fair value of borrowings carried at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2013 was UA 12,127.91 million
(2012: UA 12,175.96 million). For these borrowings, the amount the Bank will be contractually required to pay at maturity at
December 31, 2013 was UA 12,499.58 million (2012: UA 12,262.95 million). The surrender value of callable borrowings is
equivalent to the notional amount plus accrued finance charges.

Annual Report 2013 147Chapter 7 African Development Bank

As per Note P, there was a net gain of UA 46.82 million on fair-valued borrowings and related derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2013 (2012: net loss of UA 30.45 million). The fair value gain attributable to changes in the Bank’s credit
risk included in the other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was UA 46.08 million (2012: UA
79.98 million).

Fair value changes attributable to changes in the Bank's credit risk are determined by comparing the discounted cash flows
for the borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss using the Bank’s credit spread on the relevant liquid markets
for ADB quoted bonds versus LIBOR both at the beginning and end of the relevant period. The Bank’s credit spread was
not applied for fair value changes on callable borrowings with less than one year call date.

For borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2013, the cumulative unrealized fair value
losses to date were UA 611.04 million (2012: UA 935.04 million).

Equity is composed of capital and reserves. These are further detailed as follows:

Capital includes subscriptions paid-in by member countries and cumulative exchange adjustments on subscriptions (CEAS).
The Bank is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank are made up of the subscription to the initial capital, a voluntary capital increase
and the six General Capital Increases (GCI) made so far. The Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V) was approved by the
Board of Governors of the Bank on May 29, 1998 and became effective on September 30, 1999 upon ratification by member
states and entry into force of the related amendments to the Agreements establishing the Bank. The GCI-V increased the
authorized capital of the Bank by 35 percent from 1.62 million shares to 2.187 million shares with a par value of UA 10,000
per share. The GCI-V shares, a total of 567,000 shares, are divided into paid-up and callable shares in proportion of six percent (6%) paid-up and ninety-four percent (94%) callable. The GCI-V shares were allocated to the regional and non-regional
members such that, when fully subscribed, the regional members shall hold 60 percent of the total stock of the Bank and
non-regional members shall hold the balance of 40 percent.

Prior to the GCI-V, subscribed capital was divided into paid-up capital and callable capital in the proportion of 1 to 7. With the
GCI-V, the authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 10.81 percent paid-up shares and 89.19 percent callable shares.

Prior to the sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI) and by its resolutions B/BG/2008/07 and B/BG/2009/05, the Board of
Governors authorized two capital increases bringing the Authorized Capital of the Bank from UA 21,870 million to UA 22,120
million to allow the Republic of Turkey and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to become members of the Bank. The membership of these two countries will become effective upon completion of the formalities specified in the Agreement establishing the Bank and in the General Rules Governing Admission of Non-Regional Countries to Membership of the Bank. On
October 29, 2013, the Republic of Turkey was formally admitted as the 78th member country of the Bank. As at December 31,
2013, such formalities had not been completed by the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

In 2009, the Board of Directors endorsed a proposal made by Canada and Republic of Korea offering to subscribe, temporarily, to additional non-voting callable capital of the Bank in the amounts of UA 1.63 billion and UA 0.19 billion, respectively.
This proposal was adopted by the Board of Governors on February 22, 2010. Accordingly, the authorized capital stock of
the Bank increased from UA 22,120 million to UA 23,947 million by the creation of additional 182,710 non-voting shares.
These non-voting callable shares were to be absorbed by the subscriptions of Canada and the Republic of Korea to GCI-VI
when they become effective.

148 Annual Report 2013African Development Bank Chapter 7

The GCI-VI was approved by the Board of Governors of the Bank on May 27, 2010. GCI-VI increased the authorized capital
stock of the Bank from UA 23,947 million to UA 67,687 million with the creation of 4,374,000 new shares. The new shares
created are to be allocated to the regional and non-regional groups in such proportions that, when fully subscribed, the
regional group shall hold 60 percent of the total capital stock of the Bank, and the non-regional group 40 percent. The new
shares and the previous ones described above shall be divided into paid-up and callable shares in the proportion of 6 percent paid-up shares and 94 percent callable shares.

Upon conclusion of the GCI VI capital increase and following the Board of Governors’ resolutions, the temporary non-voting
callable shares of Canada and Korea described above were effectively retired in 2011 and 2012, respectively thereby reducing the authorized capital of the Bank for each of these periods by 163,296 and 19,414.

Following its Resolution B/BG/2012/04 of May 31, 2012, the Board of Governors authorized a Special Capital Increase of the
authorized share capital of the Bank to allow for: (i) subscription by a new regional member country (the Republic of South
Sudan) of the minimum number of shares required for it to become a member; and (ii) the resulting subscription by non-regional members of the number of shares necessary to comply with the 60/40 ratio requirement between the shareholding
of regional and non-regional members. Accordingly, the Board of Governors, decided to increase the authorized capital of
the Bank by the creation of 111,469 new shares, out of which 66,881 shall be available for subscription by the Republic of
South Sudan, and 44,588, shall be available for subscription by non-regional members. The additional shares are subject
to the same terms and conditions as the shares authorized in the GCI-VI. The membership of the Republic of South Sudan
shall become effective upon completion of the formalities specified in the Agreement establishing the Bank and in the General
Rules Governing Admission of Regional Countries to Membership of the Bank. As at December 31, 2013, such formalities
had not been completed.

The Bank’s capital as at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was as follows:

Included in the total unsubscribed shares of UA 1,764.92 million at December 31, 2013 was an amount of UA 38.83 million representing the balance of the shareholding of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (former Yugoslavia).

Since the former Yugoslavia has ceased to exist as a state under international law, its shares (composed of UA 38.83 million callable, and UA 4.86 million paid-up shares) have been held by the Bank in accordance with Article 6 (6) of the Bank
Agreement. In 2002, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved the proposal to invite each of the successor states of
the former Yugoslavia to apply for membership in the Bank, though such membership would be subject to their fulfilling
certain conditions including the assumption pro-rata of the contingent liabilities of the former Yugoslavia to the Bank, as of
December 31, 1992. In the event that a successor state declines or otherwise does not become a member of the Bank, the
pro-rata portion of the shares of former Yugoslavia, which could have been reallocated to such successor state, would be
reallocated to other interested non-regional members of the Bank in accordance with the terms of the Share Transfer Rules.
The proceeds of such reallocation will however be transferable to such successor state. Furthermore, pending the response
from the successor states, the Bank may, under its Share Transfer Rules, reallocate the shares of former Yugoslavia to interested non-regional member states and credit the proceeds on a pro-rata basis to the successor states. In 2003, one of

he successor states declined the invitation to apply for membership and instead offered to the Bank, as part of the state’s
Official Development Assistance its pro-rata interest in the proceeds of any reallocation of the shares of former Yugoslavia.
The Bank accepted the offer.

The subscription position including the distribution of voting rights at December 31, 2073 reflects the differences in the timing of subscription payments
by member countries during the allowed subscription payment period for GCI-VI. After the shares have been fully subscribed, the regional and nonregional groups are expected to hold 60 percent and 40 percent voting rights, respectively.

Slight differences may occur in totals due to rounding.

Prior to the fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), payments on the share capital subscribed by the non-Regional Member
Countries were fixed in terms of their national currencies. Under GCI-IlV, and subsequent capital increases payments by
regional and non-regional members in US dollars were fixed at an exchange rate of 1 UA = US$ 1.20635. This rate represented the value of the US Dollar to the SDR immediately before the introduction of the basket method of valuing the SDR on
July 1, 1974 (1974 SDR). As a result of these practices, losses or gains could arise from converting these currencies to UA
when received. Such conversion differences are reported in the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions account.

At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions was as follows:

Reserves consist of retained earnings, fair value gains/losses on investments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income, gains/losses on fair-valued borrowings arising from “own credit”, and remeasurements of defined benefit liability.

Retained earnings included the net income for the period, after taking into account transfers approved by the Board of
Governors, and net charges recognized directly in equity. Retained earnings also included the transition adjustments resulting from the adoption of new or revised financial reporting standards, where applicable.

The movements in retained earnings during 2012 and 2013 were as follows:

During the year, the Board of Governors approved the distribution of UA 107.50 million (2012: UA 110 million) from income
and the surplus account to certain entities for development purposes.

With effect from 2006, Board of Governors’ approved distributions to entities for development purposes are reported as

The net unrealized loss on derivatives on non-fair-valued borrowings and others for the year ended December 31, 2013
amounted to UA 12.72 million (2012: gain of UA 20.28 million). This included the income statement effects of the hedge
accounting, consisting of unrealized loss of UA 1.82 million, representing hedge ineffectiveness and UA 5.19 million of amor
tization of fair value adjustments on the hedged risk (See Note G).

Total administrative expenses relate to expenses incurred for the operations of the Bank and those incurred on behalf of
the ADF and the NTF. The ADF and NTF reimburse the Bank for their share of the total administrative expenses, based on
an agreed-upon cost-sharing formula, which is driven by certain selected indicators of operational activity for operational
expenses and relative balance sheet size for non-operational expenses. However, the expenses allocated to the NTF shall

not exceed 20 percent of the NTF’s gross income.

Within one year 8,551 8,390
In the second to fifth years inclusive 8,048 13,134

Leases are generally negotiated for an average term of one (1) to five (5) years and rentals are fixed for an average of one (1)
year. Leases may be extended for periods that are not longer than the original term of the leases.

The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a defined benefit plan established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 05-89 of May 30,
1989, became effective on December 31, 1989, following the termination of the Staff Provident Fund. Every person employed
by the Bank on a full-time basis, as defined in the Bank’s employment policies, is eligible to participate in the SRP, upon
completion of 6 months service without interruption of more than 30 days.

The SRP is administered as a separate fund by a committee of trustees appointed by the Bank on behalf of its employees.
In November 2004, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved certain revisions to the SRP, including simplification of the
calculation of the employee contribution rate, more explicit reference to the Bank’s residual responsibility and rights as the
SRP sponsor, changes in survivor child benefits and an increase in the pension accumulation rate from 2 percent to 2.5 percent for each year of service. Also, new members from the Field Offices of the Bank joined the Plan in 2007. Accordingly the
associated past service costs associated with these changes were reported in the financial statements of respective years.

In 2008, the early retirement provisions and the death benefits to spouses were modified, resulting in a net negative prior
service cost of UA 8.12 million, which was immediately recognized. Under the revised SRP, employees contribute at a rate
of 9 percent of regular salary. A tax factor included in the basis for the determination of contribution in the previous SRP has
been eliminated. The Bank typically contributes twice the employee contribution, but may vary such contribution based on
the results of annual actuarial valuations.

In 2011, the Board of Directors approved the extension of the mandatory staff retirement age in the Bank from 60 to 62
years effective January 1, 2012. Participants of the Plan as of May 11, 2011 were given up to December 31, 2012 to make
the election on either to retire at 60 years with no penalty for early retirement or accept the extension and retire at age 62.
The option to retire at age 60 is not available to staff joining the Bank from January 1, 2012, the date of effectiveness of the
change. Most of the existing participants opted for the revised retirement age. The impact of the change on the actuarial valuation of SRP was a curtailment of UA 10.90 million and was reported in the financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2011.

All contributions to the SRP are irrevocable and are held by the Bank separately in a retirement fund to be used in accordance
with the provisions of the SRP. Neither the contributions nor any income thereon shall be used for or diverted to purposes
other than the exclusive benefit of active and retired participants or their beneficiaries or estates, or for the satisfaction of the
SRFP’s liabilities. At December 31, 2018, virtually all of the SRP’s investments were under external management and these
were invested in indexed funds, with the following objectives: a) Equity portfolio — to track as closely as possible, the returns
of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index as well as hedging the currency exposure of the SRP’s anticipated
future liabilities; b) Bond portfolio — to track as closely as possible, the returns of the Citigroup World Government Bond Index
as well as hedge the currency exposure of the SRP’s anticipated future liabilities.

Annual Report 2013 155Chapter 7 African Development Bank

The Medical Benefit Plan (MBP) was created under the Board of Directors’ resolution B/BD/2002/17 and F/BD/2002/18 of
July 17, 2002 and became effective on January 1, 2003. Under the MBP, all plan members including existing staff or retirees
contribute a percentage of their salary or pension while the Bank typically contributes twice the employee contribution, but
may vary such contribution based on the results of annual actuarial valuations.

Contribution rates by staff members and retirees are based on marital status and number of eligible children. An MBP board,
composed of selected officers of the Bank and representatives of retirees and the staff association, oversees the management
and activities of the MBP. The contributions from the Bank, staff and retirees are deposited in a trust account. In accordance
with the directive establishing the Plan, all Plan members including staff and retirees are eligible as beneficiaries for making
claims for medical services provided to them and their recognized dependents.

The pension and post-employment medical benefit expenses for 2013 and 2012 for the Bank, the ADF and the NTF combined (the Bank Group) comprised the following:

Assumptions used in the latest available actuarial valuations at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:

 

(Percentages)

Health care cost growth rate
—at end of fiscal year 6.00 6.00
— ultimate health care cost growth rate 5.00 5.00
Year ultimate health cost growth rate reached 2014 2014

The SRP mortality assumptions are based on the Self-Administered Pension Schemes 2008 (SAPSO8) tables, specifically
referenced from the experience of United Kingdom self-administered pension schemes. Similarly, the MBP mortality assumptions are also based on the Self-Administered Pension Schemes (SAPS) tables, specifically referenced from the experience
of United Kingdom occupational schemes. These SAPS tables assume normal health participants, and have been updated
using Continuous Mortality Investigations (CMI) 2009 projections to factor in future longevity improvements.

The expected return on plan assets is an average of the expected long-term (10 years or more) returns for debt securities
and equity securities, weighted by the portfolio allocation. Asset class returns are developed based on historical returns as
well as forward-looking expectations. Equity return expectations are generally based upon the sum of expected inflation,
expected real earnings growth and expected long-term dividend yield. Bond return expectations are based upon the sum of
expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk premium. The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation is selected
by reference to the long-term year-end rates on AAA corporate bonds.

The medical cost inflation assumption is the rate of increase in the cost of providing medical benefits. This is influenced
by a wide variety of factors, such as economic trends, medical developments, and patient utilization. For the purposes of
these calculations, the initial medical cost inflation rate was assumed at 6 percent per annum between January 1, 2013 and
December 31, 2013, thereafter a constant rate of 5 percent per annum will be used.

The Bank's obligation and costs for post-retirement medical benefits are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding medical
cost inflation.

The average duration of SRP and MBP is 16.5 years and 22 years respectively.

Annual Report 2013 159Chapter 7 African Development Bank

The following related parties have been identified:

The Bank makes or guarantees loans to some of its members who are also its shareholders, and borrows funds from the
capital markets in the territories of some of its shareholders. As a multilateral development institution with membership
comprising 53 African states and 25 non-African states (the “regional members” and “non-regional members”, respectively),
subscriptions to the capital of the Bank are made by all its members. All the powers of the Bank are vested in the Board
of Governors, which consists of the Governors appointed by each member of the Bank, who exercise the voting power of
he appointing member country. Member country subscriptions and voting powers are disclosed in Note N. The Board of
Directors, which is composed of twenty (20) Directors elected by the member countries, is responsible for the conduct of
he general operations of the Bank, and for this purpose, exercises all the powers delegated to it by the Board of Governors.
The Bank also makes or guarantees loans to certain of the agencies of its Regional Member Countries and to public and
private enterprises operating within such countries. Such loans are approved by the Board of Directors.

n addition to its ordinary resources, the Bank administers the resources of other entities under special arrangements. In this
regard, the Bank administers the resources of the ADF. Furthermore, the Bank administers various special funds and trust
unds, which have purposes that are consistent with its objectives of promoting the economic development and social progress of its Regional Member Countries. In this connection, the Bank administers the NTF as well as certain multilateral and
bilateral donor funds created in the form of grants.

The ADF was established pursuant to an agreement between the Bank and certain countries. The general operation of the
ADF is conducted by a 14-member Board of Directors of which 7 members are selected by the Bank. The Bank exercises
50 percent of the voting power in the ADF and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund. To carry
out its functions, the ADF utilizes the officers, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank, for which it reimburses
he Bank based on an agreed cost-sharing formula, driven in large part by the number of programs and projects executed
during the year.

 

The Bank’s investment in the ADF is included in Equity Participations and disclosed in Note J. In addition to the amount
reported as equity participation, the Bank periodically makes allocations from its income to the Fund, to further its objectives.
Net income allocations by the Bank to ADF are reported as Other Resources in the Fund's financial statements. Net income
allocation to the Fund in 2013 amounted to UA 35 million (2012: UA 35 million).

The NTF is a special fund administered by the Bank with resources contributed by Nigeria. The ADB Board of Directors conducts the general operations of NTF on the basis of the terms of the NTF Agreement and in this regard, the Bank consults
with the Government of Nigeria. The NTF also utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank for
which it reimburses to the Bank its share of administrative expenses for such utilization. The share of administrative expenses reimbursed to the Bank by both the ADF and NTF is disclosed in Note Q.

Grant resources administered by the Bank on behalf of other donors, including its member countries, agencies and other
entities are generally restricted for specific uses, which include the co-financing of Bank’s lending projects, debt reduction
operations and technical assistance for borrowers including feasibility studies. Details of the outstanding balance on such
grant funds at December 31, 2013 and 2012 are disclosed in Note V-5.

The Bank charges fees for managing some of these funds. Management fees received by the Bank for the year ended
December 31, 2013 amounted to UA 2.05 million (2012: UA 1.78 million).

The Bank also administers the SRP and MBP. The activities of the SRP and MBP are disclosed in Note R.

The Bank may also provide personal loans and advances to its staff, including those in management. Such loans and advances, guaranteed by the terminal benefits payable at the time of departure from the Bank, are granted in accordance with the
Bank’s rules and regulations. At December 31, 2013 outstanding balances on loans and advances to management staff
amounted to UA 6.71 million (2012: UA 4.71 million).

The Bank is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to the economic and social progress of its regional
member states. The Bank’s products and services are similar and are structured and distributed in a fairly uniform manner
across borrowers.

Based on the evaluation of the Bank’s operations, management has determined that ADB has only one reportable segment
since the Bank does not manage its operations by allocating resources based on a determination of the contribution to net
income from individual borrowers.

The products and services from which the Bank derives its revenue are mainly loans, treasury and equity investments.

163Chapter 7 African Development Bank

In connection with an internationally coordinated effort between the Bank, the International Monetary Fund (the IMF), the
World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstruction efforts, the Board of Directors on June 26, 2002, approved an arrears clearance plan for the DRC. Under the
arrears clearance plan, contributions received from the donor community were used immediately for partial clearance
of the arrears owed by the DRC. The residual amount of DRO’s arrears to the Bank and loan amounts not yet due were
consolidated into new contractual receivables, such that the present value of the new loans was equal to the present
value of the amounts that were owed under the previous contractual terms. The new loans carry the weighted average
interest rate of the old loans. In approving the arrears clearance plan, the Board of Directors considered the following
factors: a) the arrears clearance plan is part of an internationally coordinated arrangement for the DRC; b) the magnitude of DRC’s arrears to the Bank ruled out conventional solutions; c) the prolonged armed conflict in the DRC created
extensive destruction of physical assets, such that the DRC had almost no capacity for servicing its debt; and d) the proposed package would result in a significant improvement in its repayment capacity, if appropriate supporting measures
are taken. Furthermore, there was no automatic linkage between the arrears clearance mechanism and the debt relief
that may be subsequently provided on the consolidated facility. In June 2004, the DRC reached its decision point under
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Consequently, the consolidated facility has since that date benefited
from partial debt service relief under HIPC.

A special account, separate from the assets of the Bank, was established for all contributions towards the DRC arrears
clearance plan. Such contributions may include allocations of the net income of the Bank that the Board of Governors
may from time to time make to the special account, representing the Bank’s contribution to the arrears clearance plan.
The amount of such net income allocation is subject to the approval of the Boards of Governors of the Bank, typically
occurring during the annual general meeting of the Bank. Consequently, income recognized on the consolidated DRC
loans in current earnings is transferred out of reserves to the special account only after the formal approval of such transfer, in whole or in part, by the Board of Governors of the Bank.

The Post Conflict Countries’ Fund was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflict in their
efforts towards re-engagement with the donor community in order to reactivate development assistance and help these
countries reach the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing their loan
arrears to the Bank Group. The framework entails the setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate facility with
allocations from the ADB’s net income, and contributions from the ADF and other private donors.

Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine post-conflict countries not yet receiving
debt relief to fill financing gaps after maximum effort by the post-conflict country to clear its arrears to the Bank Group. In
this connection, the Board of Governors by its Resolution B/BG/2004/07 of May 25, 2004, established the Post-Conflict
Countries Facility (PCCF) under the administration of the ADF and approved an allocation of UA 45 million from the 2003
net income of the Bank. The Board of Governors also, by its resolution B/BG/2005/05 of May 18, 2005, approved an
additional allocation of UA 30 million from the 2004 net income as the second installment of the Bank’s contribution to
the facility and by its resolution B/BG/2006/04 of May 17, 2006, the Board of Governors also approved the third and final
installment of the Bank’s allocation of UA 25 million from the 2005 net income. In March 2008, the Board of Directors
approved the establishment of the Fragile States Facility (FSF) to take over the activities of the PCCF and in addition
provide broader and integrated framework for assistance to eligible states. The purposes of the FSF are to consolidate
peace, stabilize economies and lay the foundation for sustainable poverty-reduction and long-term economic growth of
the eligible countries. By policy, contributions made by ADB to the PCCF/FSF are not used to clear the debt owed to
the Bank by beneficiary countries.

 

The Bank participates in a multilateral initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as HIPCs. Under
this initiative, creditors provide debt relief for eligible countries that demonstrate good policy performance over an extended

164 Annual Report 2013African Development Bank Chapter 7

period to bring their debt burdens to sustainable levels. Under the original HIPC framework, selected loans to eligible beneficiary countries were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price equivalent to the lower of the net present value of the loans
or their nominal values, as calculated using the methodology agreed under the initiatives.

Following the signature of a HIPC debt relief agreement, the relevant loans were paid off at the lower of their net present
value or their carrying value. On average, loans in the ADB’s portfolio carry higher interest rates than the present value discount rates applied and therefore the net present value of the loans exceeds the book value. Consequently, affected ADB
loans were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at book values.

The HIPC initiative was enhanced in 1999 to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was achieved
by reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much earlier than under
the original framework. Under the enhanced framework, where 33 African countries are eligible, the debt relief is delivered
through annual debt service reductions, as well as the release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service obligations as they
come due until the total debt relief is provided. In addition, interim financing between the decision and completion points of
up to 40 percent of total debt relief is provided whenever possible within a 15-year horizon.

As at end December 2013, the implementation of the HIPC initiative shows that out of the 33 eligible countries, 29 RMCs
have reached their completion points while Chad is still in interim period. Three countries, Somalia, Sudan and Eritrea
(pre-point decision) are yet to reach the decision point.

At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF,
the International Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their
claims on countries that have reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to
help 38 countries worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancelation would be delivered by relieving post-completion-point HIPCs’ repayment obligations and adjusting their gross
assistance flows downward by the same amount. To maintain the financial integrity of the ADF, donors have committed to
make additional contributions to the ADF to match “dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal and service charge payments.

The MDRI became effective for the ADF on September 1, 2006. As of that date, the ADF wrote down its balance of disbursed and outstanding loans net of HIPC relief by an amount of UA 3.84 billion, with a corresponding decrease as of that
date in the ADF’s net assets. Reduction in ADF net assets results in a decrease in the value of the Bank’s investment in
the Fund. Subsequent write-down of loan balances is effected as and when other countries reach their HIPC completion
point and are declared beneficiaries of MDRI loan cancelation. The reduction in the net asset value of the ADF does not
include loans out- standing to MDRI countries that have not reached their HIPC completion points at the end of the year.

Annual Report 2013 165Chapter 7 African Development Bank

Under Article 8 of the Agreement establishing the Bank, the Bank may establish or be entrusted with the administration of
special funds.

At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the following funds were held separately from those of the ordinary capital resources of
the Bank:

i) The NTF was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement) between the African
Development Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement stipulates that the NTF shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from the date the Agreement became effective and that the resources of the NTF shall be transferred to
the Government of Nigeria upon termination. However, the 30-year sunset period may be extended by mutual agreement
between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. At the expiry of the initial 30-year period on April 25, 2006, the Bank
and the Federal Republic of Nigeria agreed to 2 interim extensions (each for 12 months) to allow for further consultations
and an independent evaluation of the NTF.

Following the positive result of the independent evaluation, the NTF Agreement was renewed for a period of ten years starting from April 26, 2008. The initial capital of the NTF was Naira 50 million payable in two equal installments of Naira 25 million each, in freely convertible currencies. The first installment, equivalent to US$ 39.90 million, was received by the Bank
on July 14, 1976, and payment of the second installment, equivalent to US$ 39.61 million, was made on February 1, 1977.

During May 1981, the Federal Republic of Nigeria announced the replenishment of the NTF with Naira 50 million. The first
installment of Naira 35 million (US$ 52.29 million) was paid on October 7, 1981. The second installment of Naira 8 million
(US$ 10.87 million) was received on May 4, 1984. The payment of the third installment of Naira 7 million (US$ 7.38 million)
was made on September 13, 1985.

The resources of the NTF at December 31, 2013 and 2012 are summarized below:

ii) The Special Relief Fund (for African countries affected by drought) was established by Board of Governors’ Resolution
20-74 to assist African countries affected by unpredictable disasters. The purpose of this fund was subsequently expanded
in 1991 to include the provision of assistance, on a grant basis, to research institutions whose research objectives in specified fields are likely to facilitate the Bank’s objective of meeting the needs of Regional Member Countries in those fields. The
resources of this Fund consist of contributions by the Bank, the ADF and various member states.

At December 31, 2018, a total of UA 2.60 million (2012: UA 3.12 million) had been committed but not yet disbursed under
the Special Relief Fund.

The Bank has been entrusted, under Resolutions 11-70, 19-74 and 10-85 of the Board of Governors, with the administration
of the Mamoun Beheiry Fund, the Arab Oil Fund, and the Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in
Africa. These funds, held separately from those of the ordinary capital resources of the Bank, are maintained and accounted for in specific currencies, which are translated into Units of Account at exchange rates prevailing at the end of the year.

i) The Mamoun Beheiry Fund was established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 11-70 of October 31, 1970, whereby Mr. Mamoun Beheiry, former President of the Bank, agreed to set up a fund, which could be used by the Bank to reward
staff members who had demonstrated outstanding performance in fostering the objectives of the Bank.

iil) The Arab Oil Fund (contribution of Algeria) was established following Board of Governors’ Resolution 19-74 of July 4,
1974. Under a protocol agreement dated November 15, 1974, the Bank received the sum of US$ 20 million from the
Government of Algeria to be kept as a Trust Fund from which loans could be granted to member countries affected by high
oil prices. On August 11, 1975, an amount of US$ 5.55 million was refunded to Algeria upon request, leaving a balance of
US$ 14.45 million, from which loans refundable directly to Algeria have been made. At December 31, 2013, a total of US$
13.45 million (2012: US$ 13.45 million) had been so repaid.

iii) The Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa (SEAF) was established by the 20th
Meeting of Heads of State and Government of member countries of the African Union formerly Organization of African Unity
(OAV) held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from November 12 to 15, 1984, under Resolution AHG/Res. 133 (XX), with the objective of giving assistance to African member countries affected by drought and famine.

of the African Development Bank

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance
with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements and plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating
the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as at 31 December

2013, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards.

172 Annual Report 2013The resources of the African Development Fund (the ADF
or the Fund) primarily consist of subscriptions by the Bank,
subscriptions and contributions by State Participants, as
well as other resources received by the Fund. The cumulaive subscriptions to the ADF amounted to UA 22.83 billion
at December 31, 2013.

Subsequent to the initial subscriptions, additional resources
have been provided to the ADF in the form of periodic general replenishments, typically done every three years. The
welfth (ADF-12) replenishment was adopted by the Board
of Governors on January 20, 2011 and became effective on
May 3, 2011 with the total resource envelope amounting to
UA 6.1 billion including an Advanced Commitment Capacity,
or internally generated resources, of UA 2.01 billion. The
replenishment covers the 2011-2013 operational period. As
of December 31, 2013, State Participants had subscribed a
otal amount of UA 3.77 billion. Of these subscriptions, UA
315.14 million, or 8.3 percent of the replenishment amount,
remain qualified as of that date.

 

Negotiations for the thirteenth replenishment of the Fund
(ADF-13) were concluded in September 2013. Deputies
agreed on an ADF-13 resource level of UA 5.35 billion covering the three-year operational period, 2014-2016. This
figure includes projected internally generated resources of
VA 0.98 billion. The replenishment will become effective
on the date when State Participants shall have deposited
with the Fund, instruments of subscription representing an
aggregate amount equivalent to at least thirty percent of the
total intended subscriptions, provided that this date shall not
be later than March 31, 2014. At December 31, 2013, the
conditions for the effectiveness of ADF-13 replenishment
had not been met.

Under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), donor countries agree to compensate ADF for the cancellation of its loans
to Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) that have reached,
or will reach the completion point under the enhanced HIPC
initiative. The MDRI became effective on September 1, 2006
and covers the period, 2006-2054. To preserve the financial
integrity and the financing capacity of the Fund, the terms
of the MDRI require donors to fully compensate the Fund for
debts canceled under the MDRI. Donors have also agreed
that periodic adjustments would be made under the initiative

Annual Report 2013

African Development Fund Chapter 7

to reflect changes in the actual and estimated costs to the
Fund resulting from debt forgiveness.

As of December 31, 2013, the Fund had received from donors
aggregate commitments of UA 4.58 billion representing 81 percent
of the MDRI cost for the period, 2006-2054, of UA 5.67 billion.

The ADF is the concessional financing window of the Bank
Group that provides low income Regional Member Countries
with concessional loans as well as grants for projects and
programs, risk guarantees and support through technical
assistance for studies and capacity building.

Prior to the ADF-12 replenishment, no interest was charged
on ADF loans. Instead they carried a service charge of 0.75
percent per annum on outstanding balances, and a commitment fee of 0.50 percent per annum on undisbursed commitments. These ADF loans have a maturity period of 50 years,
including a 10-year grace period.

However, for ADF-12, the Board of Directors approved differentiated ADF loan lending terms to ADF-eligible countries
classified as blend, gap and graduating under the African
Development Bank Group country classification. Accordingly,
new loans extended under ADF-12 and beyond to blend, gap
and graduating countries will have a maturity period of 30
years, including an 8-year grace period with an interest rate of
1 percent per annum. In addition, the standard commitment
and service fees that apply to all ADF loans will be charged.

As ameans of stimulating additional private sector investments
in Low-Income Countries, the ADF Partial Risk Guarantee
(ADF-PRG) instrument was introduced as part of ADF-12, on
a pilot basis, to leverage resources from the private sector and
other co-financiers for ADF countries, including fragile states.
The ADF-PRG will insulate private lenders against well-defined
political risks related to the failure of a government or a government-related entity to honor certain specified commitments
and will incentivize governments to undertake policy and fiscal reforms necessary to mitigate performance-related risks.

Starting with the Thirteenth General Replenishment of the ADF,
Partial Credit Guarantees (PCG) have been added to the suite
of ADF instruments. The ADF PCG is an instrument designed
to address the challenges faced by well performing ADF only
countries and State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), in their quest
to mobilize both domestic and external commercial financing
for developmental purposes. The product will serve to partially
guarantee debt service obligations of Low-Income Countries
(LICs) and well performing SOEs in LICs. The ADF PCG is

criteria, SOEs in ADF countries with low risk and moderate

to enable well performing LICs and SOEs to catalyze larger
volumes of development financing at more attractive terms.

ADF cash and treasury investments amounted to UA 3.24
billion at December 31, 2013 compared to UA 3.42 billion at
the end of 2012. Investment income for the year amounted
to UA 67.33 million, representing a return of 1.94 percent,
on an average liquidity level of UA 3.47 billion, compared
with an income of UA 87.96 million, representing a return
of 2.70 percent on an average liquidity of UA 3.25 billion in
2012. The lower return in 2013 is primarily the result of the
low level of interest rates, impacting the average yield of the
held-at-amortized-cost portfolio, as well as the stabilization
of credit spreads at tighter levels which, unlike in 2012, did
not generate large capital gains on the portfolio at fair value.

Cumulative loans and grants signed, net of cancellations, at
December 31, 2013, amounted to UA 25.24 billion compared
to UA 24.12 billion at the end of 2012. Table 7.7 presents
loans approved, disbursed and undisbursed balances from
2009 to 2013. As the table shows, the level of loan approvals
has increased consistently since 2010.

Total outstanding loans, as at December 31, 2013 was UA
8.18 billion, UA 968.66 million higher than the UA 7.21 billion
outstanding as at the end of 2012.

At the end of 2013, there were a total of 1,118 active loans
and grants and a total of 692 loans amounting to UA 5.53
billion had been fully repaid or canceled through MDRI.

Loans and grants disbursed by the Fund increased by 45.54
percent to stand at UA 1.70 billion in 2013 from UA 1.17 billion
in 2012. As at December 31, 2013, cumulative disbursements
on loans and grants amounted to UA 18.80 billion compared
to UA 17.20 billion at the end of the previous year. A total of
2,004 loans and grants were fully disbursed for an amount
of UA 14.68 billion, representing 78.07 percent of cumulative
disbursements. Figure 7.3 tracks the evolution of loan disbursements and repayments over the past five years.

Principal loan repayments for the Fund amounted to UA 56.77
million in 2013 compared to UA 55.06 million in 2012, representing an increase of 3 percent over the previous year. Cumulative
repayments as of December 31, 2013 stood at UA 6.91 billion.

The Fund, like the Bank, employs stringent risk management
procedures in order to prudently reduce its exposure to risks,
such as liquidity, currency and interest rate risks, that are not
essential to its core business of providing development related
assistance to its clients. The details of the risk management
policies and practices employed by the Fund to manage
these risks are provided in Note C to the Financial Statements.

Annual Report 2013The following are the highlights of the Fund’s financial performance in 2013:

¢ The Fund reported a deficit of UA 123.52 million in 2013,
compared to a deficit of UA 64.61 million in 2012. The deficits
over recent years are largely attributable to certain structural changes to the Fund (including the cancellation of loans
to certain beneficiaries under the MDRI initiative described
in Note F to the financial statements; and the increased
grant elements in the ADF resource allocation), which are
compensated for through additional donor subscriptions.
Normalized for the effects of such structural changes, the
adjusted deficits for 2013 and 2012 were UA 52.57 million
and UA 1.61 million, respectively.

¢ The generally low level of interest rates prevailing globally
continued to have the dual effect of lowering the Fund’s
investment income and increasing the impact of the accelerated encashment of promissory notes deposited for payment of the Fund’s subscriptions. The decline in interest
rates has created a gap between the discount granted for
accelerated encashment of notes deposited for payment
of subscriptions and the interest earned on the investment
of the funds from the accelerated encashment.

e The Fund's share of the total shareable administrative expenses of the ADB Group increased by UA 40.60 million from
VA 185.27 million in 2012 to UA 225.87 million in 2013.
The Fund’s share of the total shareable expenses is based
on a predetermined cost-sharing formula, which is driven
primarily by the relative levels of certain operational volume
indicators and relative balance sheet size. The Fund’s percentage share of these expenses was 68.69 percent for
2013, compared to 65.91 percent for 2012.

¢ Investment income decreased from UA 87.96 million in 2012

to UA 67.33 million in 2013, while loan income increased
from UA 65.67 million in 2012 to UA 77.58 million for the

Annual Report 2013

African Development Fund Chapter 7

current year. The decrease in investment income is due to
the combination of a decrease in average investment funds
in 2013 and lower interest rates compared to 2012. The
increase in loan income was due primarily to an overall higher average outstanding loan balance in 2013. Discount on
the accelerated encashment of promissory notes amounted
to UA 38.94 million in 2013 compared to UA 31.87 million
in 2012.

According to the Fund’s non-accrual policy, service charges
on loans made to or guaranteed by borrowers are excluded
from loan income, if principal installments or service charges
on any such loans are in arrears for six months or more, until
such time that payment is received. As a result, of this policy,
UA 2.07 million of non-accrued loan income was excluded
from 2013 income compared to UA 3.84 million in 2012. The
number of borrowers in non-accrual status at December 31,
2013 remained three (3); which was the same level as at the
end of December 2012.

The Fund continued to cancel qualifying debts under MDRI
as the relevant countries reached HIPC completion point. In
2013, Comoros reached the completion point. A summary of
the cumulative loan cancellations under MDRI and HIPC is presented in Note F to the Special Purpose Financial Statements.

As with the African Development Bank (the Bank) management monitors performance measures and indicators which
reflect the critical success factors in the ADF’s business. To
the extent that the ADF extends grants in addition to lending
at highly concessional rates, the conventional profitability and
financial ratios are not deemed to be an appropriate means
of determining its effectiveness in delivering development
resources to Regional Member Countries. One proxy that the
Fund applies for measuring effective delivery of development
resources is the level of disbursements made to RMCs from
one period to another. As already noted previously, during the
year under review a total of UA 1.70 billion was disbursed for
loans and grants as compared to UA 1.17 billion made in 2012.

Annual Report 2013 181Chapter 7 African Development Fund

NOTES TO THE SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013

The African Development Fund (ADF or the Fund) was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the African
Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) in contributing to the economic and social development of the Bank’s regional members, promote cooperation and increased international trade particularly among the Bank’s members, and to provide financing on concessional terms for such purposes.

By its resolution F/BG/2010/03 of May 27, 2010, the Board of Governors increased the membership of the Board of Directors
of ADF from twelve (12) to fourteen (14), made up of seven (7) members selected by the Bank and seven (7) members selected by State Participants. The Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors, which is made up of representatives of
the State Participants and the ADB. The ADB exercises fifty percent (60%) of the voting powers in the ADF and the President
of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

The ADB, the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund administered by the ADB, and the ADF are collectively referred
to as the Bank Group. The principal purpose of the ADB is to promote economic and social development in its Regional
Member Countries. The ADB finances development projects and programs in its regional member states. The ADB also
participates in the selection, study and preparation of projects contributing to the development of its member countries and
where necessary provides technical assistance. The NTF was established under an agreement between the Bank and the
Federal Republic of Nigeria to further support the development efforts of ADB Regional Member Countries, particularly the
lesser-developed countries. The assets and liabilities of the ADB and of the NTF are separate and independent of those of
the ADF. Furthermore, the ADF is not liable for their respective obligations. Transactions with these affiliates, where there are,
are disclosed in the notes that follow.

The resources of the Fund consist of subscriptions by the Bank, subscriptions and contributions by State Participants, other
resources received by the Fund and funds derived from operations or otherwise accruing to the Fund. The initial resources
of the Fund consisted of subscriptions by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement Establishing the
Fund (the Agreement). Thereafter, the resources have been replenished through Special and General increases of subscriptions and contributions.

Due to its nature and organization, the Fund presents its financial statements on a special purpose basis. The Special Purpose
Financial Statements are prepared for the specific purpose of reflecting the net development resources of the Fund and are
not intended to be a presentation in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Net development resources represent resources available to fund loan and grant commitments and comprise primarily cash, marketable investments
and demand obligations of State Participants. These special purpose financial statements have been prepared to comply
with Article 35(1) of the Agreement establishing the Fund, which requires that the Fund circulates, at appropriate intervals, a
summary of its financial position and income and expenditure statement showing the results of its operations.

182 Annual Report 2013African Development Fund Chapter 7

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Fund’s special purpose financial statements are as follows:

The special purpose financial statements are expressed in Units of Account (UA). Article 1 of the Agreement defined a Unit
of Account as having a value of 0.81851265 grams of fine gold.

On April 1, 1978, when the second amendment to the Articles of the Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
came into effect, gold was abolished as a common denominator of the international monetary system. Computations relating to the currencies of IMF members were thereafter made on the basis of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) for purposes of
applying the provisions of the Articles of the IMF. The Fund’s Unit of Account was therefore based on its relationship to the
SDR at the time of establishment of the Fund. This was 1 Unit of Account equal to SDR 0.921052.

Subsequently, on November 16, 1992, the Board of Governors decided by Resolution F/BG/92/10 to redefine the Fund’s
Unit of Account to be equivalent to the UA of the ADB, which is defined as equivalent to the Special Drawing Right of the
IMF. In compliance with this Resolution, the Board of Directors, on June 22, 1993, adopted January 1, 1993, as the date for
the entry into effect of the Resolution, and the Fund’s UA has since then been defined as equal to the Bank’s UA.

The Fund conducts its operations in the currencies of its State Participants. Income and expenses are converted into UA at
the rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities are translated into UA at rates prevailing at the date
of the Statement of Net Development Resources. Translation differences are debited or credited to the Cumulative Currency
Translation Adjustment. Translation gains and losses on subscriptions received are credited or debited to the Cumulative
Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions and contributions. Where currencies are converted into any other currency, the
resulting gains or losses are included in income.

The rates used for translating currencies into UA at December 31, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:

2013 2012
1 Unit of Account equals:
Argentinian Peso 9.397020 6.106830

Turkish Lira 3.099970 2.734570
United States Dollar 1.540000 1.536920

No representation is made that any currency held by the Fund can be or could be converted into any other currency at the cross-rates resulting from
the rates indicated above.

Subscriptions committed by State Participants for each replenishment are recorded in full as subscriptions receivable from
participants upon submission of an instrument of subscription by the participants. A replenishment becomes effective when
the ADF receives instruments of subscription from participants for a portion of the intended replenishment level as specified in
the replenishment resolution. The portion of subscribed amounts for which payments are not yet due from State Participants
are recorded as installments on subscriptions not yet payable, and are not included in the net development resources of
the Fund. The subscriptions not yet payable become due throughout the replenishment period (generally three years) in

Annual Report 2013 183Chapter 7 African Development Fund

accordance with an agreed payment schedule. The actual payment of subscriptions when they become due from certain
participants is conditional upon the respective participant’s budgetary appropriation process.

The subscriptions receivable are settled through payment of cash or deposit of non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing demand
notes. The notes are encashed by the Fund as provided in an encashment program agreed to at the time of the replenishment.

Starting with the ADF-9 replenishment, participants were given the option of an early payment of cash in an amount equivalent to the net present value of their entire subscriptions and contributions. Upon receipt of such cash payments, participants are credited with the full face value of their entire subscriptions, and in agreement with the Fund, such cash amounts
received are invested and the income generated thereon is retained by the Fund. A discount, calculated as the difference
between the face value of the subscriptions and the cash amount received, is initially recorded to represent the interest
expected to be earned on the cash received from State Participants who opted for the accelerated encashment program.
Such discount is amortized over the projected encashment period, to recognize the effective contributions to equity by the
relevant participant over and above the initial cash advanced.

By its resolutions F/BG/2006/12 and F/BG/2006/13 of May 18, 2006 and August 31, 2006 respectively, the Board of
Governors of the Fund authorized the Board of Directors to approve the participation of the ADF in the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI) and in that regard the Board of Governors also authorized an increase in the resources of the ADF
to provide full and timely compensation for the debt cancellation under the MDRI subject to the attainment of the following
effectiveness thresholds:

1) Receipt of Instruments of Commitment from donors covering an aggregate amount equivalent to at least seventy percent (70%) of the total cost of debt relief for the first group of 14 post-completion point Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPCs); and

2) Receipt of unqualified Instruments of Commitments from donors for an amount not less than the equivalent of at least
seventy five percent (75%) of the total cost of debt relief incurred during the remainder of ADF-10 period.

Upon satisfaction of the above two thresholds, the Board of Directors of the Fund approved the effectiveness of the MDRI
with effect from September 1, 2006. To ensure full compensation for foregone reflows as a result of the upfront debt cancellation, the ADF governing bodies endorsed Management's proposal for a compensation scheme over the 50-year period
of the Initiative. Donors will contribute additional resources to ADF, equivalent to the foregone debt service (service charges
and principal) for each replenishment period, by submitting pledges over the life of the initiative. The compensatory financing arrangements will take the form of a general increase in the contribution of State Participants pursuant to Article 7 of the
Agreement Establishing ADF. The contributions received from State Participants under the compensatory financing arrangements shall not be counted as part of the burden share for the replenishment period in which such resources are received,
but shall carry voting rights in the same manner as normal subscriptions. Such contributions are separately disclosed within
the total of subscriptions and contributions in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

 

Prior to the second general replenishment, subscriptions were denominated in UA and were subject to Article 13 of the
Agreement which provided that, whenever the par value in the IMF of the currency of a State Participant is reduced in terms
of the UA or its foreign exchange value has, in the opinion of the Fund, depreciated to a significant extent within that participant’s territory, that participant shall pay to the Fund within a reasonable time an amount of its currency required to maintain
the value, as of the time of subscription, of the amount of such currency paid into the Fund by that participant and which
has not been disbursed or exchanged for another currency.

Conversely, if the currency of a State Participant has increased in par value or appreciated in its foreign exchange value within
that participant's territory, the Fund shall return to that participant an amount of such currency equal to the increase in the
value of the Fund’s holding of that currency which was received by it in payment of subscriptions, to the extent that these
amounts have not been disbursed or exchanged for another currency.

184 Annual Report 2013African Development Fund Chapter 7

In accordance with Board of Governors’ successive Resolutions governing the second through to the twelfth general replenishments of the Fund, which stipulated that Article 13 shall not apply to these general replenishments, subscribers to these
replenishments fixed the amount of their subscriptions payable in national currencies in terms of agreed parities ruling at the
date these replenishments came into force. Gains or losses arising on translating these subscriptions, when received, into
UA are applied against subscriptions, with the offsetting debits or credits recorded as Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on
Subscriptions (CEAS).

The Fund's financial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at amortized cost and financial assets at fair
value through profit or loss (FVTPL). These classifications are determined based on the Fund’s business model. In accordance
with the Fund’s business model, financial assets are held either for the stabilization of income through the management of net
interest margin or for liquidity management. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

A financial asset is classified at ‘amortized cost’ only if the asset meets the objective of the Fund’s business model to hold
the asset to collect the contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. The nature of any derivatives embedded in financial
assets are considered in determining whether the cash flows of the investment are solely payment of principal and interest
on the principal outstanding and are not accounted for separately.

If either of the two criteria above is not met, the financial asset is classified at ‘fair value through profit or loss’.

Financial assets at amortized cost include mainly demand obligations and accrued income on loans and receivables and
certain investments that meet the criteria of financial assets at amortized cost. Demand obligations are non-negotiable,
non-interest-bearing notes payable on demand deposited for subscription payment.

The Fund also classifies at amortized cost, investments of the proceeds of accelerated encashment of notes. This is consistent with the business model of the Fund of collecting contractual cash flows. The primary objective of such financial assets
is to recoup the discount granted to State Participants on the accelerated encashment program.

Financial assets that do not meet the amortized cost criteria as described above are measured at FVTPL. This category
includes all treasury assets held for resale to realize short-term fair value changes. Gains and losses on these financial assets
are reported in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Derivatives are also categorized as financial assets
at fair value through profit or loss.

Cash and cash equivalents include amounts due from banks, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and
have a time to maturity upon acquisition of three months or less.

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date the Fund commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers. Income on investments includes
interest earned and unrealized gains and losses on financial assets at FVTPL.

Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the
Fund has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

The Fund’s investment securities are classified either as financial assets at amortized cost or as at fair value. Investments
classified as financial assets at amortized cost include non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
and fixed maturities. These investments are carried and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. All other investment securities are classified as investments at fair value through profit or loss and measured at
market value.

Annual Report 2013 185Chapter 7 African Development Fund

Income on investments includes interest earned and unrealized gains and losses on the portfolio held at fair value through
profit or loss. Purchases and sales of investments are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which the Fund
commits to purchase or sell the investments.

The Fund provides concessional funding for development purposes to the least developed countries in Africa. Country eligibility
is determined by assessing gross national income per capita, creditworthiness and performance. Annual Debt Sustainability
Analysis is used to determine the risk of debt distress of each beneficiary country and set appropriate financing terms.

The following categories of countries are eligible to ADF loans:

¢ Category A countries that are not deemed creditworthy for non-concessional financing and whose income levels are below
the operational cut-off.

© Category A countries that are not deemed creditworthy for non-concessional financing but whose income levels are above
the operational cut-off (blend countries) have access to ADF funds with modified financing terms at par with those of blend
countries.

¢ Category B countries are those deemed creditworthy for non-concessional financing but whose income levels are below
the operational cut-off with access to a blend of ADB and ADF resources.

Graduating countries are those that are graduating from the category of ADF borrowing countries to the category of ADB
borrowing countries and the graduating policies are determined for each new ADF replenishment.

Disbursed and outstanding loans are reported at amortized cost and not included in Net Development Resources in the
special purpose financial statements as they represent an allocation of development resources. Accordingly, no provision
or possible loan losses is required.

Loan income arising from interest, service and commitment charges is recognized on an accrual basis. The Fund places all
loans to a borrower country in non-accrual status if the principal installments, interest or service charges on any of the loans
‘Oo such member country are overdue by 6 months or more, unless the Fund’s management determines that the overdue
amount will be collected in the immediate future. Further, management may place a loan in non-accrual status even if it is not
yet overdue by 6 months, if the specific facts and circumstances, including consideration of events occurring subsequent
‘0 the balance sheet date, warrant such action. On the date a borrower's loans are placed in non-accrual status, unpaid
interests and charges that had previously been accrued on loans to the borrower are deducted from income on loans for
hat period. Interests and charges on loans in non-accrual status are included in income only to the extent that payment of
such charges has been received by the Fund.

The Fund provides guaranties, through the Partial Risk Guarantees (PRGs) program, for credits issued in support of projects located within a member county that are undertaken by private entities. Under the PRGs program, the Fund provides
inancial guaranties for private lenders to a member country in the event that a member country fails to honor its contractual
obligations with respect to private lenders to a project. The PRGs insure private lenders against well-defined political risks
related to the failure of a government or government related entity to honor certain specified commitments such as political
iorce majeure, currency inconvertibility, regulatory risks and various forms of breach of contract.

Under the PRGs framework the Fund executes the payment obligations if the borrower defaults and the lender consequently demanding payment from the Fund. In the event that a guarantee is called, the Fund has the contractual right to require
payment from the member country that has provided the counter guarantee to the Fund.

 

Guarantee fee income received is deferred and amortized over the life of the guarantee.

In addition to loans, the Fund is authorized to provide development financing in the form of grants. Prior to the ninth replenishment of the resources of the Fund, grant funds were granted for technical assistance activities only. With effect from the
ninth replenishment, grants may be used for technical assistance as well as project financing. Grants, like loans, represent

186 Annual Report 2013African Development Fund Chapter 7

allocations of development resources and are accordingly treated as such in the Statement of Net Development Resources
of the Fund.

The Fund participates in a multilateral debt relief initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as heavily
indebted poor countries (HIPCs) to help ensure that their reform efforts are not compromised by unsustainable external debt
burdens. Under this initiative, creditors provide debt relief for those countries that demonstrate good policy performance over
an extended period to bring their debt burdens to sustainable levels. As a part of this process, the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust
Fund, (the Trust Fund) constituted by funds from donors, including the Bank Group, was established to help beneficiaries
reduce their overall debt, including those debts owing to the Fund.

Under the original framework of the debt relief initiative, upon signature of a HIPC Debt Relief Agreement by the Fund, the
beneficiary country and the Trust Fund, loans or repayment installments identified for sale to the Trust Fund are written down
0 their estimated net present value. On the settlement date, the estimated write-down is adjusted to reflect the actual diference between the cash received and the carrying value of the loans sold.

Under the enhanced HIPC framework, the implementation mechanism comprises a partial payment of ADF debt service as
it falls due with funds received from the Trust Fund.

 

Under the MDRI, loans due from eligible HIPCs are canceled when the countries attain the completion point under the HIPC
framework. The Fund is expected to be fully compensated for loans canceled under MDRI by additional contributions to be
made by donors over the previously scheduled repayment periods of the canceled loans. When MDRI becomes effective for
a country, certain amounts previously disbursed to that country as loans are no longer repayable by the country and effecively take on the character of grants made by the Fund. Accordingly, loans canceled under the MDRI are included in “Net
Debt Relief” and reported in the Statement of Net Development Resources as allocation of development resources, with a
corresponding offset to loans outstanding.

Financial liabilities include accounts payable and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are
derecognized upon discharge, cancellation or expiration.

 

The Fund assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial
assets included in its Net Development Resources is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and
impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that
occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on its receivable or treasury investments held at amortized cost (described in prior years as held-to-maturity investment), the amount of the loss is
measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows
(excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred), discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.
The estimated impairment loss may arise from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts due, and the impairment
calculations reflect management's best estimate of the effect of such delays.

The impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the asset through the use of an allowance account
and recognized in the income statement. If a treasury investment at amortized cost has a variable interest rate, the discount

rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.

Loans are not included in Net Development Resources and are therefore not subject to impairment.

Annual Report 2013 187Chapter 7 African Development Fund

The fair values of quoted financial assets in active markets are based on current bid prices, while those of liabilities are based
on current asking prices. For financial instruments with inactive markets, the Fund establishes fair value by using valuation
techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs. These include the use of recent arm’s length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market
participants. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued using methodologies and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such
financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is not readily
determinable. Management believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable; however, the values actually realizable in a sale might be different from the fair values disclosed.

The following three hierarchical levels are used for the determination of fair value:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant
inputs are based on observable market data.

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.
The methods and assumptions used by the Fund in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available, using the bid prices. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.
Government and agency obligations include marketable bonds or notes and other government obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member countries or other official entities with a minimum credit rating of AA-. For
asset-backed securities, the Fund may only invest in securities with an AAA credit rating. Money market instruments include
time deposits, certificates of deposit and other obligations with a maturity period of less than 1 year, issued or unconditionally guaranteed by banks and other financial institutions with a minimum rating of A.

Derivative Financial Instruments: The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques that use market estimates of cash flows and discount rates. The Fund also uses valuation tools
based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to value derivative financial instruments. The models
use market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. All financial models
used for valuing the Fund's financial instruments are subject to both internal and periodic external reviews.

The financial statements are adjusted to reflect events that occurred between the date of the Statement of Net Development
Resources and the date when the financial statements are authorized for issue, provided they give evidence of conditions
that existed at the date of the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the date of the Statement of Net Development resources are disclosed, but do not result in an adjustment of the financial statements themselves.

Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current year. These
reclassifications did not affect the prior year’s reported result.

188 Annual Report 2013African Development Fund Chapter 7

n carrying out its development mandate, the Fund seeks to maximize its capacity to assume core business risks resulting
from its lending and investing operations while at the same time minimizing its non-core business risks (market risk, counerparty risk, and operational risk) that are incidental but nevertheless critical to the execution of its mandate.

The degree of risk the Fund is willing to assume to achieve its development mandate is limited by its commitment capacity.
The Fund's overall risk management strategy is to minimize the exposure of its replenishment resources (the Commitment
Capacity) to the risk of over-commitment and also to protect its Net Development Resources from currency translation losses that could negatively affect the Fund’s long-term capacity to meet its development needs.

The policies, processes and procedures which the Fund uses to manage its risk profile continually evolve in response to
market, credit, product, and other developments. The highest level of risk management oversight is assured by the Fund’s
Board of Executive Directors, which is chaired by the President. The Board of Directors is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance. In addition to approving all risk management policies, the Board of Directors regularly reviews
rends in the Fund's risk profiles and performance to ensure compliance with the underlying policies.

The guiding principles by which the Fund manages its core and non-core risks are governed by the General Authority on
Asset Liability Management (the ALM Authority) approved by the Board of Directors of the Fund.

The ALM Authority is the overarching framework through which Management has been vested with the authority to manage
he Fund's liquid assets and liabilities within defined parameters. The ALM Authority sets out the guiding principles for managing the Fund's interest rate risk, currency exchange rate risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and operational risk.
The ALM Authority covers the Fund's entire array of ALM activities.

 

Under the umbrella of the ALM Authority, the President is authorized to approve and amend more detailed operational
guidelines as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO). The ALCO,
chaired by the Vice President for Finance, is the oversight and control organ of the Fund's finance and treasury risk management activities.

The ALCO meets on a regular basis to perform its oversight role. ALCO is supported by several standing working groups
that report on specific issues including interest rate risk, currency risk, operational risk, financial projections, and financial
products and services. In June 2012 the Bank Group also created the Credit Risk Committee (CRC), to ensure effective
implementation of the Fund’s credit policies and oversee all credit risk issues related to loan operations.

Day-to-day operational responsibility for implementing the Fund's financial and risk management policies and guidelines are
delegated to the appropriate business units. The Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the dayto-day compliance with those policies and guidelines.

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Fund.
Credit risk arises from the inability or unwillingness of counterparties to discharge their financial obligations. It is the potential financial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk for the Fund arising

essentially from its lending and treasury operations.

The Fund's credit risk arises from two principal sources: (i) sovereign credit risk arising from lending to its qualifying RMCs and
(ii) counterparty credit risk on its portfolio of treasury investments and derivative transactions.

Annual Report 2013 189Chapter 7 African Development Fund

The Fund provides concessional loans in order to fund economic and social development of its member countries which
generally have a lower credit quality than ADB borrowers. Although loans are included in the financial statements as resources already allocated for development and therefore not included in the Net Development Resources, the Fund still manages
sovereign credit risks to ensure equitable allocation of resources to eligible beneficiaries and ensure that expected reflows
from loan repayments are properly monitored and managed. Country eligibility for loans is determined by assessing among
other things, gross national income per capita, credit worthiness and performance. The Fund uses the International Monetary
Fund/World Bank Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for Low-Income Countries, to make performance-based allocation
(PBA) of ADF resources among the many competing needs in the continent and to ensure the funds are directed to areas
they will be used most effectively. The PBA process, which is reviewed regularly, is also used to determine the proportion
of ADF resources that is allocated in the form of grants to each qualifying borrower. On the basis of the debt sustainability
analysis, certain countries are allocated grants-only resources, while others may receive a combination of loan and grant
resources or loan resources only.

Annual Report 2013 191Chapter 7 African Development Fund

In the normal course of business, the Fund utilizes various financial instruments to meet the needs of its borrowers, manage its exposure to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates, and to temporarily invest its liquid resources prior to
disbursement. All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty to the transaction
may be unable to meet its obligation to the Fund. Given the nature of the Fund’s business, it is not possible to completely
eliminate counterparty credit risk, however, the Fund minimizes this risk by executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating standards, counterparty exposure limits, and counterparty credit
risk mitigation measures.

Counterparties must meet the Fund’s minimum credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank Group’s Vice
President for Finance. ALCO approves counterparties that are rated below the minimum rating requirements.

Counterparties are classified as investment counterparties, derivative counterparties, and trading counterparties. Their ratings are closely monitored by the Financial Management Department.

For trading counterparties, the Fund requires a minimum short-term credit rating of A-2/P-2/F-2 for trades settled under
delivery vs. payment (DVP) terms and a minimum long-term credit rating of A/A2 for non-DVP-based transactions.

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

 

Maturity
6 months 1 year 5 years 10 years 15 years 30 years

Government A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Government agencies and supranationals A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Banks AVA2 AA-/Aad AAA/Aaa
Corporations including non-bank financial institutions AVA2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa

AAA
MBS/ABS Maximum legal maturity of 50 years for ABS/MBS with the underlying collateral

originated in the UK and 40-year maximum legal maturity for all other eligible ABS/
MBS. Also, the maximum weighted average life for all ABS/MBS at the time of
acquisition shall not exceed 5 years.

The Fund uses derivatives in the management of its assets and liabilities. As a rule, the Fund executes an ISDA master agreement and collateral exchange agreement with its derivative counterparties prior to undertaking any transactions. Derivative
counter- parties are required to be rated AA-/Aa3 by at least two approved rating agencies or A-/A3 for counterparties with
whom the Fund has entered into a collateral exchange agreement. These counterparties require the approval of ALCO.
Approved transactions with derivative counterparties include swaps, forwards, options and other over-the-counter derivatives.

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Fund operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the
counter- party credit rating and size, subject to a stipulated maximum for any single counterparty. Individual counterparty
credit exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) potential future
exposure methodology and monitored regularly against the Fund’s credit limits after considering the benefits of any collateral.

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. The Fund’s
principal liquidity risk management objective is to hold sufficient liquid resources to enable it to meet all probable cash flow
needs for between 50 and 75 percent of the three years’ moving average of expected disbursements.

To strike a balance between generating adequate investment returns and holding securities that can be easily sold for cash if
the need arises, the Fund divides its investment portfolio into two tranches with different liquidity objectives and benchmarks.
The Fund's core liquidity portfolio, which is fair valued, is invested in highly liquid securities that can be readily liquidated if the
need arises to meet the Fund's short-term liquidity needs. In addition to the trading portfolio, the Fund maintains a second
tranche of liquidity under the broad category of amortized cost portfolio, which is held in a portfolio of fixed income securities
intended to earn contractual cash flows.

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. To promote stable growth in
the Fund’s Net Assets, including its Net Development Resources (NDR) and outstanding loans, the Fund’s principal currency
risk management objective is to ensure that it is able to provide the disbursement currencies requested by borrowers while
minimizing the exposure of its net development resources to adverse exchange rate movements. To the extent possible, the
Fund shall maintain the alignment of the currency composition of its Net Assets with the UA as the primary benchmark of
its currency composition. The Fund may conduct currency exchange transactions for the following two reasons: (1) to align
the currency composition of its Net Assets (loan and investment portfolios) with the UA, (2) for the purpose of providing ADF
borrowers with the disbursement currencies requested.

Interest rate risk is the potential for loss due to adverse movements in market interest rates. In seeking to earn a stable and
reasonable return on invested liquidity, the Fund’s principal interest rate risk management is to reduce the sensitivity of the
Fund’s investment returns to changes in market interest rates. To achieve this objective, the Fund’s investments are managed in two portfolios: (1) an actively managed portfolio (the “Operational” Portfolio); and (2) a passively managed portfolio
(the “Investment” Portfolio).

The Operational Portfolio provides a readily available source of liquidity to cover both expected and unexpected disbursements as well as any other probable cash outflows. The Operational Portfolio is managed against a 3-month LIBOR reference benchmark in each currency. Generally, investments in the Operational Portfolio are held for trading and are regularly
marked to market.

The Investment Portfolio consists of funds that are not immediately required for loan disbursements and therefore may be
invested for a longer horizon. Generally, investments in the Investment Portfolio are purchased with the intention to hold
them until their maturity and are not marked to market. The Investment Portfolio comprises two sub-portfolios, (1) an investment portfolio for income stabilization for the purpose of generating a stable income for the Fund and reducing the Fund’s
investment income sensitivity to interest rates. This portfolio is managed against a ten-year uniform re-pricing profile for each
invested currency, and (2) an investment portfolio for accelerated encashments for the purpose of investing proceeds from
accelerated encashments to recoup the discount granted to State Participants, minimizing or eliminating interest rate risk
on accelerated encashments. This portfolio is managed against a target rate, which is the discount rate agreed with State
Participants.

196 Annual Report 2013African Development Fund Chapter 7

The Fund has also entered into futures contracts to hedge fixed interest rate bonds against interest rate variations. As at
December 31, 2013, the Fund had 402 contracts in Euro, 1,040 contracts in Pound Sterling and 639 contracts in US Dollars.
The nominal value of each contract is one million of each currency unit, except for 1,040 GBP contracts with a nominal value of 500,000 for each contract.

Demand obligations represent subscription payments made by participants, in accordance with Article 9 of the Agreement,
in the form of non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing notes payable at their par value on demand. The Board of Governors
has agreed that the encashment of these notes will be governed by the Fund’s disbursement requirements.

According to the Fund's loan regulations, loans are expressed in UA and repaid in the currency disbursed.

Loans are generally granted under conditions that allow for repayment over 40 years after a 10-year grace period commencing from the date of the loan agreement. Loan principal is generally repayable from years 11 through 20 at a rate of 1 percent per annum and from years 21 through 50 at a rate of 3 percent per annum. A service charge at a rate of 0.75 percent
per annum on the principal amount disbursed and outstanding is payable by the borrower semi-annually. Loans and lines
of credit approved after June 1996 carry a 0.5 percent per annum commitment charge on the undisbursed portion. Such
commitment charge commences to accrue after 90 days from the date of signature of the loan agreement. With effect from
the ADF 12 replenishment, loans to blend, gap and graduating countries carry differentiated financing terms of thirty (30)
years’ maturity, grace period of 8 years and interest rate of 1 percent, in addition to the existing standard 0.50 percent commitment fee and 0.75 percent service charge.

Prior to the establishment of the Technical Assistance Account, loans for pre-investment studies were normally granted for a
period of 10 years, including a grace period of 3 years, with repayments in seven equal installments from years 4 through 10.

Of the undisbursed balances of loans signed, the Fund may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to
borrowers or others in respect of the cost of goods and services to be financed under loan agreements. As at December 31,
2013, outstanding irrevocable reimbursement guarantees to commercial banks amounted to UA 33.40 million (2012: UA
13.83 million).

The Fund also provides Partial Reimbursement Guarantees (PRGs) to private entities for development exposures on projects
located in Regional Member Countries. Such guarantees represent potential risk to the Fund if amounts guaranteed for an
entity are not reimbursed. As at December 31, 2013, guarantees provided by the Fund to private entities on account of its
borrowers amounted to UA 137.50 million (2012: nil).

As at December 31, 2013, loans made to or guaranteed by certain borrowers with an aggregate principal balance outstanding of UA 275.79 million (2012: UA 283.56 million) of which UA 103.17 million (2012: UA 98.10 million) was overdue, were in
non-accrual status. If these loans had not been in non-accrual status, income from loans for the year ended December 31,
2013, would have been higher by UA 2.07 million (2012: UA 3.84 million). At December 31, 2013, the cumulative charges not
recognized on the non-accrual loans amounted to UA 38.79 million, compared to UA 39.47 million at December 31, 2012.

Lines of credit to national development banks and similar national finance institutions are generally granted for a maximum
of 20 years, including a 5-year grace period.

At December 31, 2013, outstanding loans amounted to VA 8,182.64 million (2012: UA 7,213.99 million).

Slight differences may occur in totals due to rounding.

Under the Fund's lending policy, 5 percent of the resources available under the third and fourth general replenishments,
10 percent under the fifth and sixth general replenishments, and 7.5 percent under the seventh and eighth general replenishments were allocated as grants and grant-based technical assistance for the identification and preparation of development projects or programs in specified member countries. In addition, amounts in the range of 18 to 21 percent of the total
resources under the ninth replenishment were set aside in the form of grants for permitted uses, including technical assistance and project financing. Grants do not bear charges. The share of grants under the tenth, eleventh and twelfth general
replenishments is based on a country-by-country analysis of debt sustainability. Under the seventh, eighth and ninth general
replenishments, technical assistance may also be provided on a reimbursable basis.

Technical assistance loans are granted under conditions that allow for repayment in 50 years, including a 10-year grace period,
from the date of the loan agreement. However, the following categories of loans have different terms:

(i) where the loan is granted for the preparation of a pre-investment study and the study proves that the project is not feasible, the grace period is extended to 45 years with a repayment period of 5 years thereafter.

(ii) where the loan is granted for strengthening Regional Member Countries’ cooperation or for the improvement of the

operations of existing institutions and is not related to specific projects or programs, the grace period is 45 years with a
repayment period of 5 years thereafter.

198 Annual Report 2013African Development Fund Chapter 7

Technical assistance loans do not carry charges.

Under the original framework of HIPC, selected loans to beneficiary countries were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price
equivalent to the net present value of the loans as calculated using the methodology agreed under the initiative. Following
the signature of a HIPC debt relief agreement, loans identified for payment were written down to their estimated net present
value. The amount of the write-down, representing the difference between the book value and net present value of the loans,
was shown as an allocation of development resources. The amount of UA 71.08 million which was the write-down in respect
of the debt relief granted to Mozambique in 1999 under the original HIPC framework is included in the amount stated as
net debt relief in the Statement of Net Development Resources. The outstanding balance and net present value of the loans
owed by Mozambique and sold to the HIPC Trust Fund in 1999 were UA 132.04 million and UA 60.96 million, respectively.

In 1999, the HIPC initiative was enhanced to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was achieved
by reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much earlier than under
the original framework. Under the enhanced framework, where 33 African countries are currently eligible, debt relief is delivered through annual debt service reductions which allow the release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service obligations
as they come due until the total net present value (NPV) of debt relief, determined by the debt sustainability analysis (DSA),
is provided. Interim financing of up to 40 percent of total debt relief is granted between the decision and completion points.
Total contributions by the Fund to the HIPC initiative at December 31, 2013 amounted to UA 184 million and are shown as
allocation of development resources in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF,
the International Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their
claims on countries that have reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative. Through the
Development Committee Communiqué of September 25, 2005, the donor community expressed its support for the MDRI,
and urged the institutions referred to above to proceed with the necessary steps to ensure implementation.

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to help
38 countries worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancellation
is delivered by relieving post-completion-point HIPCs’ repayment obligations and adjusting their gross assistance flows
downward by the same amount. To maintain the financial integrity of the ADF, donors are expected to make additional contributions to the ADF to match “dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal and service charge payments.

The MDRI became effective for the ADF on September 1, 2006. Since disbursed and outstanding loans are already excluded
from net development resources, the debt cancellation did not have an impact on the Fund’s balance of net development
resources. Cancellation of ADF debts are effected when other eligible countries reach the HIPC completion point.

At December 31, 2013, a gross amount of UA 5.53 billion (2012: UA 5.52 billion) of outstanding loans had been canceled
under MDRI for 29 (2012: 28) HIPC completion-point countries. Of this amount, UA 1,225.99 million (2012: UA 1,225.99
million) in nominal terms were converted by the HIPC Trust Fund. The present value of the converted loans was UA 942.71
million (2012: UA 942.71 million). As of December 31, 2013, the present value amounts have been transferred from the
HIPC Trust Fund to ADF.

Arrears Clearance Mechanism for DRC — In connection with an internationally coordinated effort including the ADB Group,
the IMF, the World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in
its reconstruction efforts, the Board of Directors on June 26, 2002 approved an arrears clearance mechanism for the DRC.
Under the arrears clearance mechanism, representatives of ADF State Participants (the Deputies) authorized an allocation
of approximately UA 36.50 million of grant resources from the ninth replenishment of the ADF (ADF-9) to clear the entire
stock of the DRC’s arrears to the Fund. The Deputies also authorized the use of approximately UA 11.77 million of the residual Supplementary Financing Mechanism (SFM) resources from ADF-8 as a partial payment against the DRC’s arrears on
charges to the ADB.

Fragile States Facility Framework — The Fragile States Facility (FSF) was established in March 2008 to provide a broader and
integrated framework for assistance to eligible states, typically Regional Member Countries of ADB emerging from conflict
or crisis. The purposes of FSF are to consolidate peace, stabilize economies and lay the foundation for sustainable poverty
reduction and long-term economic growth. The FSF assumes the arrears clearance activities of the now defunct Post Conflict
Countries Facility (PCCF), which was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflicts in clearing their
arrears and prepare them for re-engagement with the donor communities, in order to reactivate development assistance
and help these countries reach the HIPC decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing their loan arrears to the Bank
Group. The framework entails the setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate facility with contributions from
the ADF, the ADB and private donors. Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine eligible
fragile states not yet receiving debt relief to fill financing gaps after maximum effort by the country to clear its arrears to the
Bank Group. Contributions made by the Fund to the facility cannot be used to clear the debt owed to the Fund by beneficiary fragile state. Contributions by the Fund to the Facility are included in “Grants and Technical Assistance Activities” in the
Statement of Net Development Resources.

The Fund's initial subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement, and states
acceding to the Agreement since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants
in the form of a special general increase and twelve general replenishments. Details of these movements are shown in the
Statement of Subscriptions and Voting Power in Note M.

The Board of Governors, by its resolution F/BG/2011/01 of January 20, 2011, approved the twelfth general replenishment
of the Fund (ADF-12), following the Deputies agreement for a replenishment level of UA 6.10 billion, of which UA 2.01 billion
represents internally generated resources, for the three-year operational period, 2011 to 2013. ADF-12 came into effect on
May 3, 2011 after the State Participants had deposited with the Fund, enough instruments of subscriptions to meet the threshold of 30 percent of pledged subscriptions. At December 31, 2013, subscriptions to ADF-12 amounted to UA 3.77 billion.

The Republic of Turkey was admitted to the ADF on October 29, 2013, becoming the Fund’s 26th State Participant. As per

the Board of Governors’ Resolution F/BG/2008/05, Turkey's initial subscription amount was set to UA 40.69 million. This
subscription amount was paid in full on June 25, 2013, and included in the Fund’s resources.

At their meeting held in Paris on September 25 and 26, 2013, the Deputies reached agreement on the terms of the Thirteenth
General Replenishment (ADF-13) of the Fund. In accordance with the Agreement establishing the Fund, the replenishment report authorizing the ADF-13 replenishment has been submitted to, and approved by the Board of Governors by its
Resolution F/BG/2014/01 of January 31, 2014. The thirteenth replenishment will come into effect on the date when State
Participants shall have deposited with the Fund, Instruments of Subscription representing an aggregate amount equivalent
to at least thirty percent (80%) of the total intended subscriptions.

At December 31, 2013, cumulative contributions pledged on account of the MDRI amounted to UA 5.67 billion of which UA
667.24 million had been paid and included in total subscriptions. Consistent with the resolution approving MDRI, the contributions paid entitle the State Participants to voting rights, as reflected in Note M.

Gains or losses arising from translation of subscriptions and contributions received into UA are recorded in the Cumulative
Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions account in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

In conformity with the findings of the UN General Assembly, the Board of Directors accepted that the former Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia no longer exists as a state under international law and hence is no longer a State Participant in the
Fund or a member of the Bank. Pursuant to a decision of the Board of Directors of the Fund in 1998, the subscriptions of
the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the Fund less the unpaid portion, are deemed to have become part of
the permanent patrimony of the Fund and are not returnable to any entity. Accordingly, the amounts of the paid subscriptions are reported as part of other resources in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Also included in other resources is a total of UA 496.99 million representing contributions by the Bank of UA 494.99 million, and
by the Government of Botswana of UA 2 million towards the Fund’s activities, in accordance with Article 8 of the Agreement.

The Fund has available resources entrusted to it under Article 8 of the Agreement, which empowers the Fund to receive other
resources including grants from State Participants, non-participating countries, and from any public or private body or bodies.

At December 31, 2013, the undisbursed balance of trust fund resources was UA 3.22 million (2012: UA 2.68 million) representing the balance of a grant received from Japan for the development of human resources in Africa.

Resources of the trust funds are kept separate from those of the ADF.

Annual Report 2013 901Chapter 7 African Development Fund

Pursuant to Article 31 of the Agreement, the Fund reimburses the ADB for the estimated fair value of its use of the latter's
offices, staff, organization, services and facilities. The amount of such administrative expenses reimbursed is based on a
predetermined cost-sharing formula, which is driven, in large part, by the Fund's relative share of the number of programs
and projects executed during the year by the Bank Group. The administrative expenses incurred by the Fund for the year
amounted to UA 225.87 million (2012: UA 185.27 million).

The general operation of the Fund is conducted by a 14-member Board of Directors, of which 7 members are selected by
the Bank. The Bank exercises 50 percent of the ADF’s voting power and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President
of the Fund. In accordance with the Agreement, the Fund utilizes the officers, staff, organization, services and facilities of the
ADB (the Bank) to carry out its functions, for which it reimburses the Bank as disclosed in Note K. In this regard, the Bank
administers the resources of the Fund. The Fund also administers trust funds entrusted to it by one of its State Participants.

This report is made solely to the Fund’s Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Article 26(v), 35(1) and 35(3) of the
Agreement establishing the Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Fund’s Board of Governors those

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these special purpose financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the special purpose financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the special purpose financial
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement
of the special purpose financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risks assessments, the auditor considers
internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and presentation of the special purpose financial statements in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall special purpose financial statement presentation.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the special purpose financial statements of the Fund have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with

the accounting and financial reporting matters as set out in the accounting policies in note B to the special purpose financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013.

Annual Report 2013The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) is a special fund administered by
the Bank. The Fund’s resources primarily consist of subscriptions by the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The NTF was established in 1976, for an initial period of thirty (80) years, when an
agreement establishing the NTF was executed between the
Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria, with a provision for
extension by mutual agreement. After two annual extensions
in 2006 and 2007, the operation of the NTF was extended
for ten years with effect from April 25, 2008, following a positive evaluation of its performance during the initial thirty (80)
years of operation.

NTF provides financing in the form of loans to the least developed and low income Regional Member Countries at concessionary rates in order to enhance economic development
and social progress in Africa. While in the past the NTF has
provided concessional financing exclusively to public sector
operations, for the extension period to 2018, the Fund’s mandate has been expanded to cover financial support to private
sector operations as well, including the microfinance subsector.

The cash and treasury investments of the NTF, all denominated
in US Dollars, amounted to UA 120.75 million at December 31,
2013, compared to UA 126.57 million at the end of 2012.
Investment income for 2013 was UA 0.45 million, representing a return of 0.38 percent, on an average liquidity level of
UA 117.89 million, compared to an income of UA 0.98 million
representing a return of 0.93 percent on an average liquidity of
UA 105.71 million in 2012. The stabilization of credit spreads
at tighter levels in 2013 did not generate large capital gains
similar to 2012. As a result, the relative performance of the
portfolio versus its benchmark is therefore lower.

Cumulative loans signed, net of cancellations, as at December 31,
2013, increased by UA 18.77 million to UA 278.77 million
compared to UA 260 million at the end of 2012. During 2013,

there were new loan approvals of UA 31.17 million compared
with UA 12.90 million in 2012. Table 7.8 presents the evolution of loans approved, loans disbursed and the undisbursed
balances from 2009 to 2013. From the table, the level of loan
approvals continues to show an upward trend since 2010.

As at December 31, 2013, there were 35 active loans with an
outstanding amount of UA 45.75 million and 48 fully repaid
loans amounting to UA 123.33 million.

Disbursements decreased from UA 1.76 million in 2012 to VA
0.96 million in 2013. As at December 31, 2013, cumulative
disbursements amounted to UA 238.07 million. A total of 69
loans amounting to UA 235.06 million were fully disbursed
as at December 31, 2013, representing 98.73 percent of
cumulative disbursements on that date. Figure 7.4 shows
the evolution of loan disbursements and repayments over
the past five years.

Principal loan repayments amounted to UA 6.09 million in
2013 compared to UA 6.28 million in 2012, representing a
decrease of 3.01 percent over the previous year. Cumulative
repayments as of December 2013 stood at UA 160.05 million.

207Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund

The NTF, similar to the Bank, seeks to reduce its exposure to
risks that are not essential to its core business of providing
development related assistance, such as liquidity, currency
and interest rate risks. The Fund follows stringent risk management procedures in managing these risks. Note D to the
Financial Statements of the Fund provides the details of the
risk management policies and practices employed by NTF.

The highlights of the Nigeria Trust Fund's financial performance
in 2018 include the following:

¢ NTF’s income before distributions approved by the Board of
Governors decreased by UA 0.59 million from UA 2.17 million
in 2012 to UA 1.58 million in 2013, mainly due to a decrease
in investment income, owing to the low interest rates. Loan
income also decreased slightly from UA 1.70 million in 2012

208

to UA 1.53 million as a result of the reduction in the interest
rates charged on NTF loans from 4 percent to a range of 2
percent to 4 percent following the revision to its Agreement.

e Administrative expenses representing the NTF’s share of
the total shareable expenses of the ADB Group, decreased
by UA 0.14 million from UA 0.56 million in 2012 to UA 0.40.
million in 2013. The NTF’s share of the total shareable
expenses of the ADB group is based on a predetermined
cost-sharing formula, which is driven by the relative levels
of certain operational volume indicators and relative balance
sheet-size. However, the NTF’s share of the total administrative expenses is capped at no more than 20 percent of
its gross income in any year.

The NTF’s reserves net of cumulative currency translation
adjustments increased from UA 36.03 million at the end of
2012 to UA 37.19 million on December 31, 2013, a 3.22
percent increase.

Annual Report 2013Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 7

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013

The Nigeria Trust Fund (the Fund or NTF) was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement)
between the African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The African Development
Bank, which is headquartered in Abidjan, Céte d’lvoire, manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government
of Nigeria. The purpose of the Fund is to assist in the development efforts of the poorer ADB Regional Member Countries.
The Agreement stipulates that the Fund shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from the date the Agreement became
effective and that such sunset date may be extended by mutual agreement between the Bank and the Federal Republic of
Nigeria. The Agreement expired on April 26, 2006 and was extended twice for one-year periods, to allow for the completion
of an independent review of the operation of the Fund. Following the successful completion of the independent review, the
Agreement has been extended for a period of ten years starting from April 26, 2008.

The financial statements of the Fund are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The financial statements have been prepared under
he historical cost convention except for certain financial assets that are carried at fair value.

The significant accounting policies employed by the Fund are summarized below:

nterest income is accrued and recognized based on the effective interest rate for the time such instrument is outstanding
and held by the Fund. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial asset to the asset’s net carrying amount. Commitment fees are accrued for unutilized loan facilities.

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments measured at fair value
hrough profit or loss.

The Fund conducts its operations in United States Dollars, and has determined that its functional currency is the United States
Dollars (USD). In accordance with Article VIl, section 7.3, of the Agreement establishing the Fund, the financial statements
are presented in Units of Account (UA).

 

The value of the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank as equivalent to one
Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF.
At December 31, 2013, 1 UA was equivalent to 1.54000 United States dollars (2012: 1.58692 USD).

Income and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
are translated from USD to UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Translation differences are included in reserves
under cumulative currency translation adjustment (CCTA). Changes in COTA are reported in the statement of changes in
equity. Capital replenishments are recorded in UA at the exchange rates prevailing at the time of receipt. Translation gains
and losses on conversion of currencies into UA are included in the determination of net income.

Annual Report 2013 915Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Fund assumes related contractual rights or obligations.

In accordance with IFRS 9, the Fund classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at amortized
cost; and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). These classifications are determined based on the
Fund’s business model. In accordance with the Fund’s business model, financial assets are held either for the stabilization
of income through the management of net interest margin or for liquidity management. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

A financial asset is classified as ‘amortized cost’ only if the asset meets the objective of the Fund’s business model to hold
the asset to collect the contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. The nature of any derivatives embedded in financial
assets are considered in determining whether the cash flows of the investment are solely payment of principal and interest
on the principal outstanding and are not accounted for separately.

If either of the two criteria above is not met, the financial asset is classified as at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial assets at amortized cost include loans and receivables on amounts advanced to borrowers and certain investments that meet the criteria of financial assets at amortized cost. Loans and receivables comprise demand obligations,
accrued income and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts receivable. Loans and receivables
are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise
when the Fund provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. Loans and
receivables are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Loan origination fees are deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment of yield. Incremental direct
costs associated with originating loans are expensed as incurred as such amounts are considered insignificant.

Investments classified as financial assets at amortized cost include investments that are non-derivative financial assets with
fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities. These investments are carried and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Financial assets that do not meet the amortized cost criteria as described above are measured at FVTPL. This category
includes all treasury assets held for resale to realize short-term fair value changes. Gains and losses on these financial assets
are reported in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Derivatives are also categorized as financial assets
at fair value through profit or loss.

Cash and cash equivalents include amounts due from banks, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and

have a time to maturity upon acquisition of three months or less.

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date the Fund commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers.

Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the
Fund has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

916 Annual Report 2013Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 7

Financial liabilities include accounts payable and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are
derecognized upon discharge, cancellation or expiration.

The Fund assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and
only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition
of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial
asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on a loan, receivable or
held-to-maturity investment carried at amortized cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the
asset's carrying amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not
been incurred), discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The estimated impairment loss may arise
from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts due, and the impairment calculations reflect management's best
estimate of the effect of such delays.

The impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the asset through the use of an allowance account
and recognized in the income statement. If a loan or other investment held at amortized cost has a variable interest rate, the
discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.

Interest and charges are accrued on all loans, including those in arrears.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle
the liability simultaneously.

In liquid or active markets, the most reliable indicators of fair value are quoted market prices. A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group,
pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an
arm’s length basis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive. Indications that a market might
be inactive include when there is a wide bid-offer spread or significant increase in the bid-offer spread or there are few or no
recent transactions observed in the market. When markets become illiquid or less active, market quotations may not represent the prices at which orderly transactions would take place between willing buyers and sellers and therefore may require
adjustment in the valuation process. Consequently, in an inactive market, price quotations are not necessarily determinative
of fair values. Considerable judgment is required to distinguish between active and inactive markets.

The fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices, while those of liabilities are based on
current asking prices. For financial instruments with inactive markets or unlisted securities, the Fund establishes fair value by
using valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs. These include the use of recent arm’s
length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used
by market participants. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued using
methodologies and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at
which such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not readily determinable. Management believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable; however, the
values actually realized in a sale might be different from the fair values disclosed.

Annual Report 2013 O17Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund
The following three hierarchical levels are used for the determination of fair value:
Level 7: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant
inputs are based on observable market data.

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.
The methods and assumptions used by the Fund in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans: The Fund does not sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The fair value of loans
reported in these financial statements represents management’s best estimates of the expected cash flows of its loans. The
fair valuation of loans has been determined using a discounted cash flow model based on year end market lending rates in
USD, including impairment percentages when applicable.

Retained earnings of the Fund consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior years’ income and unallocated current
year net income.

In the preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, management makes certain estimates, assumptions and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are
based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances.

The most significant judgments and estimates are summarized below:

The Fund first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Fund determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in a
group of financial assets with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment.

Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not
included in a collective assessment of impairment. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment
losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred
after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future
cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets and can be reliably estimated.

If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or investments carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying
amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred)
discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the income statement.

918 Annual Report 2013Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 7

The fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets is measured by using valuation techniques. Where
valuation techniques (for example, models) are used to measure fair values, they are validated and periodically reviewed by
qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All models are periodically calibrated to ensure that outputs
reflect actual data and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, valuation models use only observable data; however, areas such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatilities and correlations require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current year. These
reclassifications did not affect prior year’s reported result.

At the date of issue of these financial statements, certain new and amended International Financial Reporting Standards and
nterpretations were effective for application by the Fund and have been applied in preparing these financial statements.

FRS 10 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. IFRS 10 introduces a new control model to
determine whether an investee should be consolidated. This IFRS defines the principle of control and establishes control as
he sole basis for determining which entities should be consolidated by the reporting entity. It also establishes principles for
he presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements when an entity has determined that it controls one or
more other entities.

The adoption of IFRS 10 does not have any significant impact on the Fund’s financial position or performance.

FRS 13 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. IFRS 13 defines fair value; sets out in a single
FRS a framework for measuring fair value; and requires disclosures about fair value measurements.

FRS 13 explains how to measure fair value for financial reporting which is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific
measurement. It does not require fair value measurements in addition to those already required or permitted by other standards and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside financial reporting. However,
his standard expands the concepts and principles behind fair valuation. In addition, extensive disclosures about fair value
are required under IFRS 13, and in particular when an entity relies on unobservable valuation inputs under the “level 3” fair
valuation hierarchy.

The adoption of IFRS 13 does not have any significant impact on the Fund’s financial position or performance.

 

n December 2011, IASB issued new disclosure requirements in respect of the effect of offsetting arrangements on an entity’s
financial position, as part of a common project with the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The new requirements are set out in Disclosures-Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (amendment to IFRS 7), and are related to
financial assets and liabilities that are offset in the statement of financial position or that are subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements. As part of the same project, the IASB also published Disclosures-Offsetting Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities (amendment to IAS 32) clarifying the offsetting criteria in IAS 32 to address inconsistency in their application.

The amendments to IFRS 7 are to be applied in the financial statements for the annual periods beginning on or after January 1,
2013 with those relating to IAS 32 being effective from annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014. The application
of IFRS 7 revisions did not impact the financial position or performance of the Fund as the amendments primarily relate to
disclosures and presentation of qualifying financial assets in the statement of financial position. The Fund has early adopted

Annual Report 2013 719Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund

the revisions to IAS 32 but the application has no impact on the financial position of the Fund, as the amendments merely
clarify offsetting criteria and how these are to be applied in practice.

As described in Note A, the Bank manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government of Nigeria. In the course
of exercising its fiduciary duties, the Bank applies specific risk management policies designed to protect the resources of
the Fund through the Bank’s General Authority on Asset and Liability Management (“the ALM Authority”). The ALM Authority
sets out the guiding principles for managing the Fund's risks, including interest rate risk, currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and operational risk.

Under the ALM Authority, the President of the Bank is authorized to approve and amend more detailed operational guidelines
as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO). ALCO is the Bank’s
most senior management forum on finance and financial risk management issues and is chaired by the Vice President for
Finance of the Bank.

The ALCO meet on regular basis to perform its oversight roles. Among its functions, the ALCO reviews regular and ad-hoc
finance and treasury risk management reports and projections and approves strategies to adjust the balance sheet. ALCO
is supported by several standing working groups that report on specific issues including interest rate risk, currency risk and
financial projections.

In June 2012, the Bank Group created a Credit Risk Committee and in November 2013, the Bank Group also created the
position of the Group Chief Risk Officer, reporting directly to the President, to oversee credit issues on the loan portfolio.

Day-to-day operational responsibilities for implementing the Bank's risk management policies and guidelines are delegated
to the relevant business units, and the Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the day-to-day compliance with those policies and guidelines.

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Fund.

Credit risk is the potential financial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of
risk for the Fund arising from its lending and treasury operations essentially and it includes sovereign credit risk from lending
operations, and counterparty credit risk.

When the Fund lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the
borrowing member state. Also, in extending credit to sovereign entities, it is exposed to country risk which includes potential
losses arising from a country’s inability or unwillingness to service its obligations to the Fund. Country credit risk is managed
through financial policies and lending strategies, including individual country exposure limits and overall creditworthiness
assessment. These include the assessment of each country’s macroeconomic performance as well as its socio-political
conditions and future growth prospects.

Annual Report 2013

291Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund

The Fund's credit risk management framework is based on a systematic credit risk assessment using a uniform internal credit
risk rating scale that is calibrated to reflect the Fund's statistical loss expectations as shown in the table below.

These sovereign risk credit ratings are derived from a risk assessment on five risk indices that include macro-economic performance, debt sustainability, socio-political factors, business environment and portfolio performance. These five risk indices
are combined to derive a composite sovereign country risk index and then converted into separate country risk ratings. These
country risk ratings are validated against the average country risk ratings from accredited rating agencies and other specialized international bodies. The Credit Risk Committee reviews the country ratings on a quarterly basis to ensure compliance
with country exposure limits, changes in country credit risk conditions, and to approve changes in loss provisioning, if any.

It is the Fund’s policy that if the payment of principal, interest or other charges becomes 30 days overdue, no new loans to
that country, or to any public sector borrower in that country, will be presented to the Board of Directors for approval, nor
will any previously approved loan be signed, until all arrears are cleared. Furthermore, for such countries, disbursements on
all loans to or guaranteed by that borrower country are suspended until all overdue amounts have been paid.

Counterparty credit risk is the potential for loss due to failure of a counterparty to honor its obligation. Various financial instruments are used to manage the fund’s exposure to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates, and to invest its liquid
resources prior to disbursement. All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty
to the transaction may be unable to meet its obligation to the Fund.

Given the nature of the Fund’s business, it is not possible to completely eliminate counterparty credit risk, however, this risk
is minimized by executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating
standards, counterparty exposure limits, and counterparty credit risk mitigation measures. Counterparties for treasury assets
must meet the Fund’s minimum credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank’s Vice President for Finance. For
counterparties that are rated below the minimum rating requirements, approval is required by ALCO.

weighted average life for all ABS/MBS at the time of acquisition shall not exceed 5 years.

The Fund invests in money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3.

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Fund operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the
counterparty credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 10 percent of the Fund's total liquidity for any single counterparty.
Individual counterparty credit exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements
(BIS) potential future exposure methodology and monitored regularly against the Fund's credit limits after considering the
benefits of any collateral.

As shown in the following table, the estimated potential counterparty credit exposure of the investment portfolio continues
to be predominantly in the AA- or higher-rated class:

2008 55% 34% 11%

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. In order
to mitigate liquidity risk, the Fund’s investment management policy ensures it has sufficient liquid assets to meet its disbursement obligations.

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. The Fund manages its currency
risk by holding all of its investments and loans in U.S. dollars, the currency in which the Fund’s resources are denominated.

Annual Report 2013 993Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund

The Fund is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its portfolio of loans and investments. All of the Fund’s loans have fixed
interest rates. Investments are managed against the monthly average of three-months LIBOR in order to manage prudently
the available resources. Re-pricing risk is not considered significant in comparison to the Fund’s equity resources, and is

accordingly not hedged.

At December 31, 2013, the Fund had UA 40.70 million of loans which were committed but not yet disbursed (2012: UA 22.86
million). The interest rate on these undisbursed loans has been fixed at between 2 to 4 percent per annum.

Interest rate risk positions as at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:

The Fund holds all of its investments and loans in U.S. dollars and therefore is exposed only to translation adjustment as the
Fund’s assets are reported in UA for financial statements purposes. Any change in the UA/USD exchange rate would have
an impact of approximately 40 percent on these reported values.

Movements in interest rates have an impact on the reported fair value of the trading portfolio. The table below shows the

Annual Report 2013 995Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund

As part of its portfolio management strategy, the Fund invests in government and agency obligations, time deposits, and

asset-backed securities.

For government and agency obligations with final maturities longer than 1 year, the Fund may only invest in obligations with
counterparties having a minimum credit rating of AA- issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member

The notional balance of investments as at December 31, 2013 was UA 107.05 million (2012: UA 121.55 million), while the
average yield was 0.23 % (2012: 0.54%).

Loans originated prior to September 22, 2003; carry an interest rate of four percent (4%) on the outstanding balance. With
effect from September 22, 2003, pursuant to the Board of Governors’ resolution B/BG/2003/11 of June 3, 2003 and the protocol agreement between the Government of Nigeria and the Bank, dated September 22, 2003, the interest rate on loans
was changed from a flat 4 percent per annum to a range of 2 percent to 4 percent (inclusive) per annum on the outstanding
balance and future undisbursed loans. Furthermore, a 0.75 percent commission is payable on undisbursed balances commencing 120 days after the signature of the loan. Loans approved prior to the extension of the Agreement are granted for a
maximum period of twenty-five years including grace periods of up to five years.

Following the extension of the Agreement in April 2008, the terms of the NTF loans were further modified in line with the
terms of financing in the operational guidelines of the Fund, approved pursuant to the Board of Directors’ resolution ADB/BD/
WP/2008/196 of December 2, 2008 which stipulates that the resources of the Fund will henceforth be deployed in accordance with the following three options:

Financial terms for the first option include: (i) no interest charges on NTF loans; (ii) a service charge of 0.75 percent per annum
on outstanding balances; (iii) a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum on undisbursed commitments; and (iv) a 20-year
repayment period with a 7-year grace period.

Financial terms for the second option include: (i) no interest charges on NTF loans; (ii) a service charge of 0.75 percent per
annum on outstanding balances; (iii) a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum on undisbursed commitments; and (iv) a

15-year repayment period with a 5-year grace period.

Financial terms for the third option would be the same terms as for the ADB private sector financing, taking into consideration the risk analysis of the project.

Annual Report 2013 997]Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund

For all the above mentioned options, the grace period starts from the date of signing of the financing agreement or at a date
agreed amongst co-financiers, in the case of co-financed projects.

For private sector operations, a commitment fee of 0.75 percent per annum on undisbursed balances will be charged from
120 days after the signing of the loan agreement.

The NTF shall provide financing to suit the needs of its borrowers.

In order to promote broader coverage of the NTF resources, utilization will be subject to a ceiling for each operation. For
both public and private sector operations, a ceiling of US$10 million per project will apply. Project proposals of more than
US$10 million may be considered if there is strong justification. This will be subject to review as appropriate depending on

the recommendations of the mid-term reviews of the NTF.

The Fund's loan regulations require that loans be expressed in UA and repaid in the currency disbursed. At December 31,
2018, all loans disbursed were repayable in United States Dollars.

The contractual maturity structure of outstanding loans as at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was as follows:

1976, and the second installment, equivalent to US$ 39.61 million, was received on February 1, 1977.

During May 1981, the Federal Republic of Nigeria announced the replenishment of the Fund with Naira 50 million. The first
installment of Naira 35 million, equivalent to US$ 52.29 million, was received on October 7, 1981. The second installment of
Naira 8 million, equivalent to US$ 10.87 million, was received on May 4, 1984. The third installment of Naira 7 million, equivalent to US$ 7.38 million, was received on September 13, 1985.

According to the Agreement establishing NTF, the Fund shall pay to the Bank the expenses incurred in the management of
the Fund as follows:

a) Separately identifiable costs incurred by the Bank for the Fund; and
b) Indirect costs incurred by the Bank in the management of the Fund.

However, the annual payment for the aforementioned expenses incurred by the Bank shall not exceed 20 percent of the
Fund’s gross income during the course of each year. The administrative cost-sharing formula may be reviewed from timeto-time by mutual agreement.

The amount of UA 0.40 million charged for the year ended December 31, 2013 (2012: UA 0.54 million) represents the Fund’s
share of the Bank Group expenses.

The Nigeria Trust Fund is administered by the African Development Bank. The ADB conducts the general operations of the
NTF on the basis of the terms of the Agreement and in consultation with the Government of Nigeria. The NTF utilizes the
offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank and reimburses the Bank for its share of the costs of such
facilities, based on an agreed-upon cost-sharing formula (see Note J). The amount outstanding at December 31, 2013 in
respect of Fund's share of administrative expenses was UA 0.03 million (2012: UA 0.23 million) and is included in Accounts
Payable on the balance sheet.

The objective of the Fund is to provide loan funds to the poorer ADB Regional Member Countries for development purposes.
The Fund’s products and services are similar and are structured and distributed in a fairly uniform manner across borrowers.
Management has concluded that the Fund has only one reportable segment in accordance with IFRS 8.

The main products and services from which the Fund derives its revenue are mainly loans to ADB Regional Member Countries
and treasury investments.

External revenue for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 is detailed as follows:

 

(UA thousands)

2013 2012
Interest income and charges on loans 1,530 1,700
Treasury investment income 455 980
Total external revenue 1,985 2,680

The Fund’s development activities are divided into five sub-regions of the continent of Africa for internal management purposes, namely: Central Africa, East Africa, North Africa, Southern Africa, and West Africa. Treasury investment activities are
carried out mainly outside of the continent of Africa, and are therefore not included in the table on the next page. In presenting information on the basis of the above geographical areas, revenue is based on the location of customers. The Fund uses
ADB's offices, staff, organization, services and facilities and therefore has no fixed assets of its own.

There were no revenues deriving from transactions with a single external customer that amounted to 10 percent or more of
the Fund’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013.

On March 26, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Bank authorized these financial statements for issue to the Board of
Governors. The financial statements are expected to be approved by the Board of Governors of the African Development
Bank at its annual meeting in May 2014.

as set out in notes A to M.

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, for the purpose of
submitting approved and audited financial statements to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank, as required by
Section 8.2 of the Agreement establishing the Fund. This report is made solely to the Board of Governors of the Bank, as a body, in
accordance with Section 8.2 of the Agreement establishing the Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to
the Board of Governors those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Fund and the Board of Governors of the
Bank as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Independent Auditor's Report to the Board of Governors

of the African Development Bank in respect of the Nigeria Trust Fund

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance
with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements and plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating
the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as at 31 December

2013, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards.

Annex V
The African Development Bank Group

The African Development Bank (ADB) resources, which
are generally obtained through capital market borrowings,
are used to provide loans to its RMCs on non-concessional
terms. Resources from this window are also used to support
private sector projects in all RMCs through direct loans, lines
of credit, trade finance facilities, equity and quasi-equity participations, and guarantees to financially sound and viable
private enterprises, and multinational projects that support
regional integration.

The ADB's standard loan product has evolved over time,
with terms that are increasingly more accommodating and
responsive to client needs. The current standard loan product offered to sovereign and sovereign guaranteed clients is
the Enhanced Variable Spread Loan (EVSL) which gives borrowers a high degree of flexibility to manage their interest rate
risks. For non-sovereign guaranteed clients the loan product
offered is the Fixed Spread Loan (FSL).

The lending rate on the EVSL comprises a floating base rate
(6-month LIBOR for USD and YEN, 6-month EURIBOR for
Euro and 3 month JIBAR for ZAR), a funding margin that is
a function of the Bank’s cost of funding relative to LIBOR,
EURIBOR or JIBAR computed every six month, and a contractual spread that was set at 60 basis points (bps) with effect
from January 01, 2011. At a borrower’s request, the EVSL
offers a free option to convert the floating base rate into a fixed
base rate (amortizing swap rate set at borrower's request for
disbursed loan balances). The repayment period for sovereign
and sovereign guaranteed loans is up to 20 years, including
a grace period not exceeding 5 years.

The lending rate on the FSL comprises a floating base rate
(6-month LIBOR for USD and YEN, 6-month EURIBOR for
Euro and 3 month JIBAR for ZAR) which remains floating until
maturity date or a fixed base rate plus a risk-based credit
spread. Non-Sovereign Guaranteed Loans (NSGLs) have
repayment periods up to 15 years including a grace period
not exceeding 5 years.

In December 2013, the ADB Board of Directors approved the
introduction of the Fully Flexible Loan (FFL) product to the suite
of products available to sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed
borrowers. The FFL embeds risk management features currently offered through the Bank’s Risk Management Products
in Sovereign Guaranteed Loans (SGLs), thereby providing full
customization flexibility in interest rate and currency conversion to borrowers. It also introduces a maturity-based pricing

950

structure and increase the maximum tenor, grace period and
average maturity (weighted average time to repay a loan) of
SGLs from the current 20, 5 and 12.75 years to 25, 8 and
17 years, respectively to allow borrowers to select loan profiles that match their funding needs and debt management
capacities.

The lending rate of the FFL product is consistent with that of
the EVSL plus a maturity premium, where applicable. With
maturity based pricing, loans with average maturity less than
or equal to 12.75 years will not attract a maturity premium.
However, loans with average maturity greater than 12.75 years
but less than or equal to 15 years will attract a 1Obps maturity
premium, while loans with an average maturity greater than
15 years will attract a 20 bps maturity premium.

The FFL will be available as the Bank’s standard loan product offered to sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed borrowers in respect of loans signed or after the date of approval of
conversion guidelines to be issued by Management in 2014.

The African Development Fund (ADF) resources emanate
from contributions and periodic replenishments by ADF-State
Participants, usually on a 3-year basis. No interest is charged
on ADF loans. The loans, however, carry a service charge
of 0.75 percent per annum on outstanding balances, and a
commitment fee of 0.50 percent per annum on undisbursed
commitments. Project loans span a 50-year repayment period,
including a 10-year grace period. Lines of credit (LOCs) have
a 20-year repayment period, which also includes a 5-year
grace period. The Fund also provides grants to RMCs, and
these do not carry any interest charges. For blend countries
(see Appendix IV), however, the lending terms have been
made more stringent during the ADF-12 (2011-2013) period, as follows: 30 years’ maturity, a grace period of 8 years,
and an interest rate of 1 percent on project loans. The other
terms remain the same, namely: 0.75 percent service charge
on outstanding balances and 0.5 percent commitment fee
on undisbursed commitments.

The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) resources are provided entirely by the Federal Republic of Nigeria under an Agreement
signed with the Bank in 1976 for an initial period of 30 years.
Following its revision in April 2008, the Agreement provides
that the resources of the Fund shall be used in accordance
with the terms of the following three options:

Annual Report 2013Annex V (continued)
The African Development Bank Group

¢ First option: (a) no interest charges on NTF loans; (b) a service
charge of 0.75 percent per annum on outstanding balances;
(c) acommitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum on undisbursed commitments; and (d) a 20-year repayment period,
including a 7-year grace period.

© Second option: (a) no interest charges on NTF loans; (b) a
service charge of 0.75 percent per annum on outstanding
balances; (c) a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum
on undisbursed commitments; and (d) a 15-year repayment
period including a 5-year grace period.

Annual Report 2013

Annexes

¢ Third option: Same terms as for the ADB private sector loans,
taking into consideration the provisions of the Guidelines
for the Bank's private sector financing as well as the risk
analysis of the project.

Loans granted prior to the revision of the Agreement carried

interest at rates that ranged between 2 percent and 4 percent,
with a commission of 0.75 percent on undisbursed portions.

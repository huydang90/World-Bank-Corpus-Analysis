THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP

Comprises
The African Development Bank (ADB)
The African Development Fund (ADF)
The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF)

The African Development Bank is the premier financial development institution of Africa dedicated to combating
poverty and improving the lives of the people of the continent and engaged in the task of mobilizing
resources toward the economic and social progress of its regional member countries.

(Bank Group Vision)

THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

he ADB is a regional, multilateral development bank
whose shareholders include the 53 countries in Africa
and 24 non-African countries from the Americas, Asia,
and Europe. The latter are also State Participants in
e ADF in addition to South Africa, which is in line to
ecome a fully fledged State Participant. The Bank's primary objective is to promote the economic development
and social progress of its regional member countries
(RMCs) — individually and jointly. The Bank was estabished in 1964, with its headquarters in Abidjan, Céte
‘Ivoire, and officially began its operations in 1967.
However, due to the political situation in Céte d'Ivoire
and the decision taken subsequently at the Governors’
Consultative Committee (GCC) in Accra, the Bank has
een operating from the Temporary Relocation Agency
(TRA) in Tunis since February 2003.

e central goal of Bank activities is promoting sustain
able economic growth and reducing poverty in Africa.

e Bank finances a broad range of development proj
ects and programs. In this connection, it:

* Provides public sector loans (including policy-based
loans), private sector loans, and invests in equity;

* Offers technical assistance for projects and programs
that provide institutional support;

* Promotes public and private capital investment;

¢ Responds to requests for assistance in coordinating
RMC development policies and plans; and

* Provides grants of up to US$ 500,000 for emergency
humanitarian assistance.

National and multinational projects and programs that

promote regional economic cooperation and integration

are also given high priority.

 

 

ANNUAL REPOR

 

he Agreement Establishing the Bank provides for a
Board of Governors as the highest policy-making organ
of the Bank, with one representative from each member
country. The Board of Governors issues general direcives concerning the Bank's operations and approves
amendments to the Bank Agreement, the admission of
new members, and increases to the Bank's capital.

he ADB Board of Governors elects an 18-member
Board of Directors to which it delegates its powers,
with the exception of those expressly reserved to it
in the Bank Agreement. Twelve directors are elected
rom the regional member countries (RMCs) and 6 are
elected from the nonregional member countries for
a 3-year term, renewable for one term. The Board of
Directors is responsible for overseeing all Bank operaions. It sets policies and guidelines for Bank operaions and for its financial and administrative activities.
t also approves all loans, guarantees, equity investments, and borrowings.

 

The Board of Governors elects the President of the Bank
Group for a 5-year term, renewable for one term. The
President, who must be from one of the Bank's regional member countries, chairs the Board of Directors,
appoints Vice-Presidents in consultation with the Board,
and is responsible for the day-to-day management of
Bank operations.

The Bank's financial resources include ordinary capital
resources of subscribed capital, reserves, funds raised
through borrowing, and accumulated net income. At its
annual meeting in May 1998, the Board of Governors
authorized the Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V),
raising the Bank's authorized capital by 35 percent toUA 21.87 billion. In addition, the Board of Governors
modified the total proportional shareholding between
regional members and nonregional members to 60 percent and 40 percent, respectively.

The ADB provides loans to its clients on nonconcessional
terms. In October 1997, the Bank introduced 3 new loan
products to meet the needs of its clients: a single-currency variable-rate loan, a single-currency floating-rate
loan, and a single-currency fixed-rate loan. The interest
rate for the single-currency variable-rate loan is based
on the semester's average cost of all outstanding Bank
borrowings specifically allocated to fund these loans.

The interest rate for the floating-rate loan is based on

the 6-month LIBOR in the menu of currencies offered by

the Bank. For fixed-rate loans, the rate is based on the

Bank's cost of borrowing to fund them. The terms of

repayment for Bank loans are as follows:

* a repayment period of up to 20 years, including a
grace period not exceeding 5 years for public sector
loans;

* a repayment period of up to 14 years, including
a grace period not exceeding 4 years for publicly
guaranteed lines of credit; and

* arepayment period of 5 to 15 years, including a 1-3
year grace period for private sector loans.

THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FUND

The ADF was created in 1973 and began operations
in 1974. Participants in the ADF comprise the ADB
and State Participants. The Fund's major objective is to
reduce poverty in RMCs. It provides loans on concessional terms to low-income RMCs for projects and programs, as well as technical assistance support for studies
and capacity-building activities.

The Agreement Establishing the ADF designates a Board
of Governors as the Fund's highest policy-making organ.
The Board of Governors meets at least once annually. The
ADF Board of Directors, which includes 6 non-regional
members nominated by their constituencies and 6 executive directors representing the ADB, is responsible for
overseeing the general operations of the Fund.

The resources of the Fund come from contributions
and periodic replenishments by participants, usually on
a 3-year basis. The Ninth Replenishment of ADF came
into effect on January 30, 2003 when State Participants

deposited instruments of subscription for the minimum
level required under the ADF-IX Replenishment resolution. At the end of December 2004, subscriptions by
State Participants amounted to UA 1.81 billion. The ADF
Deputies agreed on a replenishment level of UA 3.7 billion for the Tenth Replenishment of the Fund (ADF-X),
which will cover the period 2005-2007. Subscriptions to
ADF-X are scheduled to start in 2005.

There is no interest charged on ADF loans. However, such
loans carry a service charge of 0.75 percent per annum
on outstanding balances, and a commitment fee of
0.50 percent per annum on undisbursed commitments.
Project loans have a 50-year repayment period, including
a 10-year grace period; and lines of credit have a 20-year
repayment period with a 5-year grace period.

THE NIGERIA TRUST FUND

The NTF is a special ADB fund created in 1976 by
agreement between the Bank and the Government of
the Federal Republic of Nigeria to assist in the development efforts of low-income RMCs whose economic and
social conditions and prospects require financing on
concessional terms. NTF became operational on April
25, 1976, following approval of the NTF Agreement
by the Board of Governors. Its initial capital of US$ 80
million was replenished in 1981 with US$ 71 million.
On December 31, 2004, total NTF resources amounted
to US$ 540.26 million. The NTF lends at 2-4 percent
interest rate, with a repayment period of up to 25 years,
including a grace period of up to 5 years.

In April 2003 the ADB Board of Governors considered
and approved a number of proposals by the NTF to
enhance its effectiveness, including: (i) an adjustment
of the interest rate for NTF loans from 4 percent to a
range of 2 to 4 percent to increase the concessionality of the loans; (ii) an allocation of 10 percent of the
annual net income of the NTF as a contribution to the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Trust Fund; (iii)
appropriation of resources from the corpus of the NTF
to finance activities under the Technical Cooperation
Agreement (TCA) with the Bank Group to support
programs to the benefit of its RMCs; and (iv) the introduction of more flexibility in the investment of the NTF
resources, pending their use in finance projects.

MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS
AND PRESIDENT OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP

 

Omar Kabbaj

 

The year 2004 - marking the fortieth anniversary of the
founding of the African Development Bank - proved a
remarkable one both for the Bank Group and for Africa as
a whole. | am delighted to report that in the past year the
Bank achieved the highest annual lending, grant, and debt
relief approvals since its establishment. This was accompanied by other outstanding achievements: the Bank Group
recorded the highest level of income; the Bank succeeding
in recruiting nearly one hundred professional staff - the
largest number for a single year; and training and capacity-building activities offered by the Joint Africa Institute
and the African Development Institute attracted the highest
number of participants.

=

Board approvals of loans, grants, and debt relief in 2004
reached an unprecedented level of UA 2.8 billion. Of this,
UA 1.5 billion came from the ADB window - with UA 164.4
million for the private sector - UA 1.3 billion from the ADF,
and UA 9.3 million from the NTF. There was also a substantial increase in HIPC debt relief approvals, amounting to over
UA 1 billion.

 

In addition, the Bank Group succeeded in mobilizing UA
2.9 billion through its cofinancing operations, raising the
total amount of resources mobilized for its regional member
countries in 2004 to UA 5.7 billion. Despite the significantly
higher volume of operations, the Bank continued to give

 

due attention to ensuring high quality in project design
and implementation, with a focus on attaining measurable
results on the ground.

As in previous years, the Bank Group channeled its support
to the operational priority areas identified in its 1999 Vision
Statement and its 2002 Strategic Plan. Agriculture and rural
development, health, education, private sector development, and infrastructure (primarily rural infrastructure)
accounted for the bulk of approvals. Furthermore, it sought
to promote gender equity, good governance, and environmental sustainability in all its operations.

The Bank also paid particular attention to supporting
regional cooperation and integration efforts, particularly in
the context of the NEPAD initiative. At the request of the
NEPAD Heads of State and Government Implementation
Committee, the Bank has assumed the leadership role in
banking and financial standards and in regional infrastructure development. In the latter, it continued to implement
the Short Term NEPAD Infrastructure Action Plan. To date, it
has approved US$ 520 million to finance projects identified
in the plan, and has mobilized a further US$ 1.6 billion from
other sources to cofinance these projects. In addition, the
Bank has launched a medium to long-term strategic framework study for regional infrastructure, in close collaboration
with the NEPAD Secretariat, the regional economic communities, the World Bank, and the European Union.

The year 2004 also witnessed the launching of two major
Bank initiatives. The first is the Post-Conflict Countries
Facility (PCCF), which was established with contributions of
UA 100 million each from the operating income of the Bank
(over 3 years) and from the African Development Fund. The
Facility, in collaboration with other donors, assists eligible
countries to clear their arrears with the Bank Group in the
context of internationally agreed programs. | am pleased to
note that two countries - Burundi and Congo — have already
benefited from the Facility.

The second - the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative
(RWSSI) — aims to accelerate access to sustainable safe water
supply and basic sanitation in rural Africa, with the objective
of reaching, in line with the Millennium Development Goal,
a coverage of 80 percent by 2015. The Initiative won thestrong endorsement of African countries and the donor community at the recent International Conference organized by
the Bank, with the assistance of the French Government.

The record level of operations in 2004 was accompanied by
a further strengthening of the financial base of the Bank.
The combined operating income from the 3 windows of the
Bank stood at a record of UA 226.9 million. This improved
outcome is due to improved repayment performance by
borrowing countries, prudent financial management, and
ongoing stringent control of administrative expenses.

Another milestone in 2004 was the successful conclusion of
the consultations on the Tenth Replenishment of the African
Development Fund (ADF-X), with State Participants in the
Fund agreeing on a replenishment level of UA 3.7 billion for
the period 2005-2007. This represents an increase of 43 percent over the actual resources mobilized under ADF-IX and is
the highest replenishment in the history of the Fund.

The ADF-X replenishment includes important new features.
The share of grant resources was significantly increased
from 18-21 percent under ADF-IX to close to 45 percent
under ADF-X. The terms of ADF financing for individual
countries will now be based on the new IMF/World Bank
Debt Sustainability Framework, with some two-thirds of
eligible countries expected to receive their ADF allocations
in the form of grants only. In addition, the resources for
multinational programs and projects have been raised from
10 percent of resources under ADF-IX to 15 percent under
ADF-X. Lastly, the higher volume of ADF-X resources would
enable the Fund (together with the Bank) to cover up to
30 percent of the total costs of the recently launched Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative.

 

| am gratified by the highly successful outcome of the ADF-X
negotiations. It signifies the continued commitment of ADF
donors to support Africa's development. Furthermore, it is a
reflection of the confidence of State Participants in the progress that the Bank Group has made over the last decade.
With the successful conclusion of ADF, | am pleased to
note that the Bank Group has in the last decade mobilized
over US$ 25 billion in donor resources, nearly equal to the
resources that it had mobilized in the previous 3 decades.

The outstanding achievements of the Bank Group in the past
year were mirrored by Africa's remarkable economic performance in 2004. GDP growth was the highest in some 8 years,
in large part buoyed by a favorable external environment but
also reflecting the results of reform programs. The region also

achieved a fiscal balance for the first time in decades, the
inflation rate was the lowest in over two decades, and the
current account recorded a surplus. Progress was also made
at the regional level with the strengthening of regional economic communities, with the African Peer Review Mechanism
(APRM) holding its inaugural meeting in February 2004. Some
23 countries — or over 40 percent of all countries - have now
subscribed to the APRM.

Looking forward, | am confident that the African Development
Bank Group will continue to scale up the progress it has made
over the last decade. To this end, the Bank has developed an
Action Plan that has been endorsed by the Board of Directors.
Important components of the Plan include: an accelerated
rogram of decentralization - with the planned opening of
an additional 8 offices in 2005 and a further 8 in 2006; the
recruitment of close to 200 professional staff over the next
3 years; a series of actions covering the entire project cycle
‘© improve the quality of operations, enhance their development effectiveness, and make the Bank a results-based
institution; and actions to strengthen the research work of
he Bank, including its economic and sector work.

he international context for the operations of the Bank
as also improved considerably. The donor community
is now devoting much closer attention to Africa’s development challenges, as evidenced by the Report of the
United Nations Millennium Project and the Report of the
Commission for Africa. These have called for a doubling of
ODA flows to Africa, further debt reductions, and removal
of the impediments that stand in the way of the expansion
of Africa's exports. All these are critical to enable African
countries to attain the Millennium Development Goals.

 

| am confident that with the deepening of their reform program and continued support from the international community, African countries will continue to build on their achievements of recent years. And in this endeavor, the African
Development Bank Group, with its strengthened financial
base and enhanced institutional capacity, will continue to
provide strong financial support and quality assistance to the
development efforts of its regional member countries.

President of the Bank Group

ANNUAL REPORT 2004

Xixey) Executive Summary

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Introduction

he year 2004 was a milestone for the African
Development Bank in that it marked the fortieth anniversary of the Bank’s establishment. This event was celebrated initially by a special symposium immediately following
he Annual Meetings in Kampala, Uganda, in May 2004,
and then later in September by an eminent gathering at
he Bank's Temporary Relocation Agency (TRA) in Tunis
of African political leaders, together with international
development partners and experts. At the Tunis celebraions, the President of the African Development Bank,
Mr. Omar Kabbaj, noted that “Clearly, Africa finds itself
‘oday at a considerably more favorable historical conjuncure with respect to its development prospects” than it
had when the Agreement Establishing the Bank was first
signed in Khartoum, Sudan, some 40 years previously.
he venue provided an opportunity not only to look back
on the solid progress made by the Bank over 4 decades
in promoting the economic and social development of its
regional member countries, but also to share the wealth
of experience of the distinguished guests to address the
future challenges that affect the Bank as an institution
and the continent as a whole.

 

In recent years, the Bank's role has been accentuated by
the welcome emergence of African-led initiatives such as
the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)
and the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM). These
have served to reinforce the framework of regional cooperation and integration and to build both an enabling
environment for policy reform and RMCs' absorptive
capacity for development assistance.

The year 2004 was also a milestone in that it represented
the first full year of operations for the Bank Group at its
Temporary Relocation Agency (TRA) in Tunis, subsequent to
the recommendation taken by the Governors’ Consultative
Committee in February 2003 for the Bank to temporarily
relocate from its statutory headquarters in Abidjan, Cote
d'Ivoire to Tunis. Despite the disruptions inevitably created
by the temporary relocation, the Bank managed to ensure
the security of its staff and dependants, the continuity
of its essential and time-sensitive financial activities, and
to deliver on its development mandate. The year 2004
therefore witnessed the full resumption of the Bank's
operational activities, the reactivation of its professionallevel staff recruitment campaign, which had been halted

Xx ™ ANNUAL REPORT 2004

by the temporary relocation, and the acceleration of the
decentralization strategy to establish a network of 25 field
offices by the year 2006.

Africa's Improved Economic Performance in 2004
Bank Group interventions in member countries during
2004 were carried out against a background of continued
recovery in the global economy and an increase in Africa's
rate of growth. Global economic growth rebounded to
5.1 percent in 2004 compared to 3.9 percent in 2003. The
improved performance was mainly due to strong growth in
the advanced economies and unprecedented rapid expansion in emerging countries, especially China and India. The
United States continued to be the main engine of economic
growth in the developed economies, attaining a growth
rate of 4.1 percent in 2004. Similarly, in Japan, the world’s
second largest economy, economic recovery accelerated in
the first half of 2004 before gradually subsiding, leading to
an average growth of 3.6 percent in 2004.

In Africa, real GDP growth continued its upward trend
and attained a rate of 5.1 percent in 2004, as against
4.4 percent in 2003 and 3.5 percent in 2002. Africa’s
strengthened economic performance in 2004 is due to
a number of factors. A major contributory element is
the improved macroeconomic policies that have been
implemented in several countries, together with institutional and structural reforms, which have in turn boosted
private sector confidence and investment. Further factors
have been the significant rise in oil and non-fuel commodity export prices, better weather conditions, expansionary effects of the global recovery, and debt relief
under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative.

BANK GROUP OPERATIONS

Bank Group operations during 2004 continued to emphasize the overarching twin objectives of poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth in its RMCs, as
articulated in its Vision Statement and in line with the UN's
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). A new strategic
orientation has been introduced to the operational thrust
of the Bank's interventions by the coming into effect in
2003 of the Bank Group's Strategic Plan for the period
2003-2007 and its subsequent 2004 Annual Review. This
lays emphasis on ensuring the effectiveness of the Bank's
operations on the ground, particularly through the implementation of a new generation of Country Strategy Papers(CSPs), taking into account 3 cardinal principles: (i) greater
selectivity in the Bank Group's areas of intervention, in line
with the operational priorities spelt out in the Strategic
Plan; (ii) country ownership of development programs
and projects and participatory approaches at all stages of
the project cycle to empower stakeholders; and (iii) closer
cooperation and collaboration with key strategic partners
in the delivery of development assistance to RMCs.

Policy Approvals

The Boards of Directors considered and approved in 2004
various program and policy documents, including 14
key policies, guidelines and strategic initiatives aimed at
strengthening the effectiveness of Bank Group's operations. These were: Bank Group Policy on the Environment;
Bank Group Policy on Poverty Reduction; Bank Group
Policy on the Disclosure of Information; Bank Group Policy
on Guarantees; Guidelines for Preventing and Combating
Corruption and Fraud in Bank Group Operations;
Guidelines for Bank Group Operations Using Sectorwide Approaches (SWAps); Guidelines for Development
Budget Support Lending (DBSL); Guidelines for PolicyBased Lending on Governance (PBLG); Guidelines on the
Establishment of the African Water Facility; Policy on the
Establishment of an Inspection Mechanism for the African
Development Bank; Bank Group Post-Conflict Assistance
Policy Guidelines; the Post Conflict Assistance Policy
Guidelines - Arrears Clearance Framework; Proposal for
the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative; and the
Private Sector Development Strategy.

The Committees of the Board held 17 meetings to review
operations and development effectiveness reports, audit
and finance reports, as well as administrative affairs and
human resource policy issues. In addition to considering and approving policies and guidelines, the Boards
examined a wide range of issues during these meetings
related to Bank Group operations in the RMCs as well as
the Bank's own internal activities.

Operational Activities

The Boards examined and approved lending and non-lending operations such as project and program loans, debt
relief operations, as well as grants for technical assistance
support, emergency assistance, post-conflict assistance,
in addition to equity participation investments. During
their formal meetings in 2004, the Boards examined and
approved a total of 124 operations for UA 2.79 billion
from the 3 windows, compared to UA 1.77 billion the previous year, representing an increase of almost 58 percent.

The significant increase is due to a rise in total approvals
including debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative,
post-conflict debt relief grants, and one equity participation investment. The rise in the level of HIPC approvals in
2004 reflects the fact that during 2004, the Bank Group
approved debt relief at completion point for 4 countries
(Ethiopia, Ghana, Niger, and Senegal) and approved
debt relief at decision point for one country (Democratic
Republic of Congo).

Loan and grant approvals from the concessional ADF
window accounted for UA 1.26 billion in 2004 compared
to UA 998 million in 2003, representing an increase
of nearly 26 percent. The surge in ADF operations was
mainly due to the increase in HIPC debt relief, which
accounted for UA 301.4 million from the ADF window.
Furthermore, in line with the new policy framework for
ADF operations, the share of grant operations increased
significantly, accounting for 17 percent of ADF approvals
in 2004, confirming the upward trend observed in 2003.
Standing at UA 9.3 million in 2004, NTF operations by
contrast, declined by more than 50 percent compared to
2003 approvals. All the resources from the NTF window
were targeted to agriculture and rural development.

Financing from the ADB window amounted to UA 1.52
billion, which more than doubled the amount of UA
745.8 million approved in 2003. A notable feature of the
year’s lending program from this window concerns HIPC
debt relief, which resumed in 2004 and represented over
46 percent of ADB total approvals (UA 707.8 million).
Another feature is the increase in policy-based lending
for both sector and structural adjustment programs,
which also more than doubled in 2004, rising to UA
388.7 million, compared to UA 176.7 million in 2003.

Cumulatively, the Bank Group has committed a total of UA
34.95 billion over the period 1967-2004, for 2,898 loans
and grants to its borrowing RMCs and various multinational
institutions. ADB resources accounted for 59.0 percent of
the operations, while 40.1 percent came from the concessional ADF window and 0.9 percent from NTF resources.

Lending Operations by Sector

During 2004, Bank Group lending prioritized the sectors of infrastructure (including regional integration),
multisector (including public sector management and
institutional capacity building), agriculture and rural
development, finance (principally in the form of LOCs for
onlending to private sector development), and human

capital formation (education, health, and social protection). Due attention continued to be paid to the crosscutting issues of gender, good governance, environmental
sustainability, and the fight against HIV/AIDS and other
communicable diseases.

Infrastructure project lending in 2004 amounted to UA
633.1 million for 15 operations (comprising 9 approvals for transportation, 4 approvals for water supply
and sanitation, and 2 approvals for power supply),
representing 41.8 percent of total lending approvals.
The Bank’s emphasis on infrastructural operations, particularly multinational projects and programs, aligns with
the Bank's mandate from the NEPAD Heads of State and
Government Implementation Committee (HSGIC) to
assume a lead role in this area and to support regional
integration. The bulk of the infrastructural loan approvals went to the transportation sector, accounting for
UA 492.4 million, or 32.5 percent of total loan approvals. These were directed mainly to transportation sec‘or reform programs, road network rehabilitation and
development, road upgrading and construction, particuarly in rural areas. Water supply and sanitation approvals
received UA 92.6 million and power supply received UA
48.1 million, representing 6.1 percent and 3.2 percent of
otal loan approvals respectively.

he multisector received the second largest allocation of
loan approvals (UA 402.52 million or 26.5 percent), to suport 12 programs and projects. These operations comprised
principally policy-based lending through one major sector
adjustment loan, structural adjustment loans, and instituional support for capacity building and good governance.
he beneficiary countries were those conducting macroeconomic reforms, with the aim of creating an enabling
environment for domestic and foreign investment.

 

Agriculture and rural development lending approvals
during 2004 reached UA 228.9 million for 13 operations,
accounting for 15.1 percent of total lending. Projects
and programs in this area were focused on boosting
agricultural productivity, supporting agrobusiness development, encouraging diversification of exports, and
improving food security and the living conditions of the
rural populations.

The finance sector received UA 174.0 million for 5
operations, accounting for 11.5 percent of total lending
approvals. These took the form of 5 lines of credit to support SMEs and encourage private sector development.

xxii DP ANNUAL REPORT 2004

ee

Lending approvals for the social sector amounted to
UA 77.9 million, representing 5.1 percent of total lending approvals as compared to UA 269.0 million (16.9
percent) for 17 operations in 2003. These comprised 3
approvals for education and 4 for health, to boost access
to social services, improve living standards, and to support the RMCs in the attainment of the MDGs.

Grant Financing Operations by Sector

The provisions of the ADF-IX policy require the Fund to allocate between 18 and 21 percent of its resources in the form
of grant funding, and up to 27 percent of the allocations for
those countries whose per capita income falls below US$
360. In particular, the following specific operational areas
have been targeted for increased grant financing: HIV/AIDS
interventions; post-conflict reconstruction; natural disaster
prevention and reconstruction; selected interventions in
health and education; HIPC debt relief; infrastructural development in rural communities; provision of water and sanitation; institutional support and capacity-building operations.

In 2004, Bank Group grant operations increased by 24.2
percent, totaling UA 216.7 million for 60 operations,
as against UA 174.5 million for 70 operations in 2003.
Grants from the ADF window amounted to UA 213.9
million for 54 operations, compared to UA 171.0 million
for 59 operations in 2003. The technical assistance component of grant financing amounted to UA 100.0 million,
involving some 33 operations. There were also 2 postconflict grant allocations totaling UA 41.3 million from
the ADF’s newly created Post-Conflict Countries Facility
(PCCF). The 6 grants approved under the ADB window
amounting to UA 2.8 million were for emergency assistance under the Special Relief Fund.

In terms of sectoral allocation, the priority sectors of
Bank Group grant approvals in 2004 were: the social sector with 22 grants, amounting to UA 79.2 million (36.6
percent); the multisector at UA 47.5 million (21.9 percent); agriculture and rural development, including rural
infrastructural services at UA 45.6 million (21.0 percent);
and water supply and sanitation at UA 27.9 million (12.9
percent). The remaining grant approvals were for power
supply (UA 8.0 million or 3.7 percent), the transportation
sector (UA 6.8 million or 3.1 percent), and the environment (UA 1.7 million or 0.8 percent).

Bank Group Cofinancing Operations
The Bank Group mobilizes external resources through
cofinancing operations, which serve as a critical meansor increasing capital flows to its RMCs to fund projects
and programs. Cofinancing is one of the instruments the
Bank uses to achieve synergistic benefits and to maximize
he use of scarce resources, not only in terms of finance,
but also technical assistance and capacity building.

Cofinancing activities in 2004 amounted to UA 2.85 billion
or 31 projects and programs. The Bank Group contributed
UA 850.9 million and the external cofinanciers contributed
.96 billion, representing 29.8 percent and 68.7 percent,
respectively. The multilateral partners, principally the World
Bank and the IMF, accounted for 68.8 percent and bilateral agencies 31.2 percent of the external resources. Local
inanciers and RMC governments contributed UA 42.7
million or 1.5 percent. The majority of cofinancing approvals in 2004 went to the multisector, totaling UA 2.12
billion (74.2 percent). The transportation sector received
he second largest allocation of UA 389.5 million (13.6
percent) followed by agriculture and rural development
at UA 159.0 million (5.6 percent), while the social sector,
primarily education and health, received UA 135.5 million
(4.7 percent). Power supply and water supply and sanitaion sectors received UA 29.7 million (1.0 percent) and UA
23.0 million (0.8 percent) respectively.

 

During the period 1967-2004, the Bank Group cumulaively approved 833 cofinancing operations amounting to
UA 81.05 billion. Of this total, UA 14.5 billion came from
he Bank's own resources (17.9 percent) with the external
cofinanciers contributing UA 47.6 billion (58.7 percent).
RMC governments and local cofinanciers accounted for
he balance of UA 19.0 billion (23.4 percent).

Capacity-Building and Training Activities

in RMCs

he Bank supports capacity-building activities in RMCs
hrough various means, including provision of training,
assistance to institutions, and facilitating knowledge dissemnation. In 2004 the activities included project management
raining offered through the Bank's African Development
nstitute (ADI) and a program of short courses, workshops,
seminars, and conferences on issues related to development management. Further, during the year the Bank coninued to support the implementation of the Agricultural
Management Training for Africa (AMTA) program.

 

Under the auspices of the Joint Africa Institute (JAI), the
Bank also organized 5 seminars on various themes ranging from “NEPAD and Regional Integration” to “Treasury
Risk Management Tools” and “Franchising.” Over 810

participants from RMCs took part in these training activities. In addition, the Bank continued to provide support
to the African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF).
It also managed the ADB/Japan Fellowship program,
through which 12 scholarships are awarded each year to
African graduates to pursue a Master's degree program
in a field related to economic and social development to
the benefit of their home countries. During the year the
Bank approved a grant of UA 14.8 million to support statistical capacity building in African countries in the context of the International Comparison Program for Africa
(ICP-Africa). The grant was in addition to UA 3.4 million
of in-kind contributions provided by the Bank.

Operational and Development Effectiveness

In 2004, the Bank Group continued to undertake measures to enhance the development effectiveness of its
operations. An important innovation to enhance the
impact of Bank operations is the Results Measurement
Framework, which was rolled out in 2004. This focuses
on developing measurable indicators and benchmarks
of expected performance outcomes at the project,
institutional, and country levels. Under the framework,
Country Strategy Papers (CSPs) will progressively be
results-focused and subjected to quality assessment at
various stages, including at inception, mid-term reviews,
and ex-post evaluation. Also, projects and programs
under the CSPs will be subjected to quality assessment at
entry. The Bank continues to ensure that CSPs are closely
aligned to the RMCs’ Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers
(PRSPs) so as to strengthen country ownership of projects
and enhance participatory approaches.

 

Measures have also been undertaken in the context of the
Harmonization, Alignment and Management for Results
agenda to allow the Bank to actively participate with
development partners in the Technical Working Groups,
which have eventuated from the recommendations of
the Rome Declaration, the Marrakech Memorandum
and Core Principles. These measures seek to enhance
the Bank's coordination with development partners in
resource allocation, implementation, monitoring and
reporting on the recipient country’s progress.

 

 

The decentralization program to establish 25 field offices (20
Country Offices and 5 Regional Offices) by year-end 2006
was scaled up during 2004. The pace of the decentralization of offices, staff, functions, and authority will accelerate
under the new 2005-2007 Strategic Resources Framework
for Institutional Development (SRFID). In addition to the

ANNUAL REPORT 2004

Executive Summary

CcExecutive Summary

existing 9 Regional and Country Offices, a further 8 offices
will open in 2005, followed by another 8 in 2006. Increasing
outreach in this way will enable the Bank to strengthen
its presence and dialogue with client countries. It will also
assist in the monitoring of operations in RMCs in order to
enhance implementation effectiveness and donor coordination, thereby advancing the harmonization agenda.

In order to ensure effective utilization of resources in ADF-eligible countries, the Bank is adjusting its Performance-Based
Allocation (PBA) system to include more reliable indicators
of poverty reduction strategies. One objective is to enhance
differentiation between good and poor performers and to
give greater weighting to good governance in a country’s
overall rating. This will ensure that performing countries will
receive a higher proportion of concessional resources.

MOBILIZATION OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES

The ADF-X Consultations

The major activity for the mobilization of external
resources in support of Bank Group operations in 2004
involved the Consultations for the Tenth Replenishment
of the resources of the African Development Fund (ADFX). Four consultation meetings were held with ADF
Deputies during 2004, following the December 2003
directives by the Boards authorizing commencement of
the ADF-X Consultations.

At the first meeting held in Geneva in February 16-17,
2004, the Deputies endorsed Management's preliminary
proposal for the strategic orientation of Fund activities
under ADF-X, and agreed that poverty reduction and
the promotion of sustainable growth should remain the
overarching objectives. In addition, they agreed to retain
the operational priority areas of ADF-IX. Deputies also
welcomed the proactive initiative of the Fund on the issue
of assistance to post-conflict countries.

The second ADF-X consultation meeting was held in
Kampala, Uganda, in May, immediately subsequent to the
2004 Bank Group Annual Meetings. During the second
meeting, the Deputies examined the preliminary findings
of the Independent Evaluation of ADF-VIl to IX and suggested that the “unfinished business” should be tackled
incrementally through further consolidation. The Deputies
welcomed the Action Plan to improve the implementation
of ADF operations, the proposal for the decentralization
of Bank operations and the Bank's Rural Water Supply and

 

ANNUAL REPORT 2004

ee

Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI) to be determined, at country
level, primarily through the PRSP process. They further
endorsed the proposed Framework for Clearing the
Arrears of Post-conflict Countries. In addition, the Deputies
accepted Management's proposal that the sum of UA
50-60 million from cancellations under ADF-IX be used as
the initial contribution of the Fund to enable it to provide
immediate assistance to post-conflict countries, in advance
of the official establishment of the Framework.

The third meeting was held in Tunis in September 2004, at
which time Deputies welcomed the revised Action Plan to
strengthen ADF operations. They also agreed on the need
for a proper debt sustainability framework to help determine the appropriate financing terms of ADF support to
member countries. The Deputies also considered the size,
composition, and financing of the Tenth Replenishment,
and reasserted their firm support for a significant increase
in the Fund resources. In this regard, Deputies requested
further information and analysis in order to reach a final
decision on the level of the replenishment.

The ADF Deputies, together with representatives of borrowing regional member countries, held the fourth and
final consultative meeting on the Tenth Replenishment
of the African Development Fund on December 16-17,
2004 in Copenhagen, Denmark. On the basis of the commitments made in Monterrey, Johannesburg, and at G8
meetings, the Deputies agreed on a replenishment level of
UA 3.7 billion (about US$ 5.4 billion) for the ADF-X period,
2005-2007. This represents an increase of approximately
43 percent over the actual resources mobilized under ADFIX. This significant increase in the level of replenishment
confirms donors’ confidence in the reforms undertaken
by the Bank over the last decade to strengthen operations
and better assist RMCs in their efforts toward poverty
reduction and social development.

HIPC Debt Relief

The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative was
designed to reduce poor RMCs' indebtedness, bring it to
sustainable levels, and direct external debt service savings
toward poverty reduction activities. In 2004, approvals for
debt relief operations increased substantially to UA 1.01
billion, from UA 1.85 million in 2003. This was as a result
of 5 countries that had qualified for debt relief during the
year, namely the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia,
Ghana, Niger, and Senegal, compared to just 2 countries
in 2003. The distribution of the total amount approved for
these 5 countries was UA 707.8 million from ADB resourcesand UA 301.4 million from the ADF. More grant agreements
were also concluded between the Bank Group and the HIPC
Trust Fund. To date, a total of US$ 2.07 billion has been
mobilized under the enhanced HIPC Trust Fund for the Bank
Group to finance interim and completion point debt relief
for these RMCs. The Bank has signed debt relief agreements
with the respective RMCs, and as a result the Bank Group
has delivered a total of US$ 1.59 billion to these countries.

CORPORATE AND FINANCIAL
MANAGEMENT

Corporate Management

Strategic Planning and Budgeting

n 2004 the strategic planning and budgeting function
coordinated the implementation of the Bank-wide straegic planning process and guided the deployment of
he Bank's operational, human, and financial resources
in accordance with its strategic goals and priorities. The
work included the First Annual Review of the Strategic
Plan, and coordination of the Bank's activities and consultations with development partners on the Enhanced
HIPC Initiative. In light of the expanded mandate and in
response to the need to enhance quality, effectiveness,
and client responsiveness, the Bank Group is continuing
0 scale up its organizational effectiveness. Furthermore,
on the basis of the guiding principles of the Strategic Plan
and to assist RMCs in the attainment of the MDGs, the
Bank has introduced increased selectivity in its intervenions, and is delivering better policy choices as well as
more effective aid coordination in its client countries.

n the strategic repositioning of the Bank to meet its scaledup commitments, measures have been taken to improve
he linkage between strategic planning and budgeting.
he budgeting process also takes account of the activities
stemming from the Independent Evaluation of ADF-VIl
(0 IX and those regarded as essential by Management to
strengthen the Bank's capacity to deliver more effectively
on its mandate. In order to consolidate the Bank's strategic
planning function, a revised and streamlined approach for
he balanced scorecard (BSC) was prepared during the
year. The pilot phase of the rollout is scheduled for early
2005, with the overall aim of introducing an institutional
BSC complemented with a review system to monitor progress made in the implementation of the Strategic Plan, and
to establish a framework within which to formulate future
strategic budgets.

 

Development Research and Knowledge Dissemination
The Bank's role of generating and disseminating information on African development issues provides momentum
to the RMCs in their striving toward the MDGs. It also
underpins the Bank's aim to position itself as a premier
development finance institution and intellectual leader
on the African development agenda. Information is disseminated externally and internally through the Bank's
website, major reports and publications, participation
in international and regional seminars and conferences,
as well as Bank-sponsored workshops and training programs for capacity-building in Africa.

Bank publications include the annual African Development
Report, the African Economic Outlook, and the biannual
African Development Review journal, in addition to economic and research papers. A further function of research
staff members is to provide Senior Management with
economic intelligence and policy briefs. During 2004, in
response to the recommendations of various external evaluations, Management sought approval from the Boards to
create the position of Chief Economist so as to raise the
Bank's research profile and enhance its role in knowledge
dissemination and in economic and sector work (ESW).

In the area of statistical services, the Bank continued
to strengthen the provision of technical assistance for
statistical capacity building in African countries through
the implementation of the International Comparison
Program for Africa (ICP-Africa). The ADF Board of
Directors approved a grant of UA 14.8 million to support
this Program, in addition to UA 3.4 million of in-kind
contributions provided by the Bank. The total contribution of the Bank Group comprised close to 80 percent
of the budgeted resources for the program, with other
cofinanciers being the World Bank, DFID-UK, NORADNorway, and the African Capacity Building Foundation
(ACBF). The Bank also launched the development of a
user-friendly and interactive ICP-Africa website to facilitate the exchange of data and best practices between the
Bank, the 51 participating RMCs, and other ICP-Africa
stakeholders and regional partners worldwide.

 

Human Resources Management

At the end of 2004, the staffing of the Bank stood at
1,043 (compared to 987 in 2003), of whom 649 were
of professional and management levels while 363 were
general services and 31 were adviser/assistant level.
Furthermore, the Boards approved Management's proposal for reforms in the Staff Retirement Plan. Measures

ANNUAL REPORT 2004

Executive Summary

XXV,ey) Executive Summary

centered on improving the transparency of the Plan
and harmonizing retirement regulations with those
of human resources management, to provide more
flexibility in the administration of pension benefits.
These reforms will increase the guarantee of the pension plan, eliminate discrimination, give flexibility to
participants about their choice of benefits, and ensure
the Bank’s competitiveness as an employer of choice
among multilateral development banks. The preparation of the Bank's new Human Resources Strategy also
commenced during the year 2004 and the document is
expected to be finalized during 2005. The new Strategy
will seek to strengthen the human resources management function as well as create the conditions to ensure
that the Bank attracts and retains a very strong pool of
talents and deploys them effectively to fulfill the Bank's
mandate.

Information Technology Management and
Communications

During 2004 the Bank upgraded the core applications
(SAP, SUMMIT, and DARMS) that impact on business
continuity procedures. The Bank also consolidated the
upgrading and maintenance of its IT and telecommunications infrastructure under the Information Technology
and Telecommunications Modernization Plan (ITTMP). In
addition, Management continued to address new priorities emanating from the Strategic Plan (2003-2007).
Progress was made in 2004 in the following areas: (i)
integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (SAP applications), (ii) integration of SUMMIT and NUMERIX, and
(iii) other new IT applications in Audit Department, the
Language Unit and for the Balanced Scorecard.

Financial Management

As at December 31, 2004, the authorized capital stock
of the Bank remained unchanged at UA 21.87 billion
and the total callable capital stock stood at UA 19.37
billion. Over the past several years, Management has
continued to pursue an efficient utilization of the Bank
Group's financial resources and risk-bearing capacity.
This led in 2004 to the Bank receiving top credit ratings
from the major credit agencies Standard and Poor's,
Moody's, Fitch Ratings and the Japan Credit Rating
Agency as triple A and double A+ for its senior and
subordinated debt respectively, with a stable outlook.
The ratings are a reflection of the Bank’s strong membership support, its preferred creditor status, sound
capital adequacy, and prudent financial management
and policies.

Xxvi DP ANNUAL REPORT 2004

ee

The Bank's financial management activities are focused on
2 areas: (i) the formulation of financial and risk management policies, guidelines, and procedures and (ii) the monitoring and reporting on compliance thereof. In order to
achieve these goals, the operations are divided into 3 thematic groups: (i) asset and liability management; (ii) credit
risk management; and (iii) treasury risk management

Asset and Liability Management

In 2004 the Bank's asset and liability management (ALM)
activities continued to focus on strengthening the Asset
and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) control
process by streamlining the Committee's routine decision-making functions such as maintaining alignment
with the interest rate, currency, and liquidity risk benchmarks to allow more time for its policy development and
financial strategic planning role.

During the year under review, the ALM guidelines for the
ADB and the NTF were revised and a proposal to introduce
an advanced commitment authority scheme for the ADF
in support of the ADF-X replenishment was prepared.
The advance commitment authority scheme, endorsed
by the ADF Deputies during the ADF-X Replenishment
Consultations, makes it possible to approve more loans
and grants for development, thereby eventually resulting
in increased use of the liquidity of ADF for projects and
programs in eligible member countries.

Credit Risk Management

In 2004 the Bank's credit risk management activities continued to adjust to the growing emphasis on non-sovereign guaranteed projects in the Bank's lending program.
Credit opinions were submitted to the Board for all new
projects where risks were principally of a commercial
nature. The credit management team also contributed to
the development of a new framework for assisting postconflict countries (PCCs) to clear their arrears to the Bank
Group and to qualify for debt relief under the Enhanced
HIPC Initiative. In 2004, the first 2 country cases under
the new PCC framework (for Burundi and the Congo)
were approved by the Board.

Treasury Risk Management

The Bank’s treasury risk management functions focused
in 2004 on completing the implementation of the IT
systems to handle straight-through processing of all
treasury transactions. Furthermore, a major quality assurance exercise was completed to validate and convert the
Bank's borrowing and derivatives database. Models wereimplemented to produce the necessary valuations to
comply with international accounting standards.

Internal Audit

In 2004 work continued on strengthening the Bank's
auditing functions in order to safeguard the accountability and the integrity of financial operations. Emphasis
was also placed on the planning of project audits in the
field. During the course of the year, work was ongoing to reinforce the Bank’s overall fiduciary controls.
Following the Board approval of the Guidelines for
Preventing and Combating Corruption and Fraud in
Bank Group Operations, Management has presented to
the Boards of Directors a proposal for the establishment
of an anti-corruption and fraud investigation mechanism. In addition to these mainline activities, AUDT, in
partnership with the Operations Complex, participated
in training workshops for RMCs in auditing and loan
accounting systems. The aim is to provide Bank-funded
projects with practical guidelines to set up comprehensive project records and to increase the accountability
of project funds.

Capital Market Operations
During 2004 the Bank raised UA 418 million at a
weighted average cost of 6-month US Dollar LIBOR minus
27.4 basis points and a weighted average maturity of
4.24 years. The Bank has continued to consolidate its
presence in the public bond markets. After successful
global benchmark dollar bond issues in 2002 and 2003,
the Bank issued in November 2004 a US$ 500 million
bond transaction with maturity in January 2010 at the
lowest cost achieved so far by the Bank in the public
bond markets.

The Bank also raised funds through small-sized structured
transactions, executed with an attached swap, to take
advantage of attractive funding opportunities. In addition,
the Bank returned to the Samurai market in Japan through
a JPY 5 billion transaction. All these transactions were
swapped into floating interest rate in US Dollars. As of
December 31, 2004, the borrowing portfolio of the Bank,
excluding embedded derivatives, stood at UA 5.65 billion,
keeping the institution well within its debt policy limits.

 

Budgets for the Year 2005

In December 2004 the Boards of Directors approved for
the year 2005 an Administrative Expenses Budget of UA
165.5 million, a Capital Expenditure Budget of UA 7.00
million, and a Contingency Budget of UA 1.65 million.

Executive Summary

The Boards approved an indicative administrative budget
of the Fund for the financial year ending December 31,
2005 for the amount of UA 124.9 million, of which UA
124.7 million is management fee and UA 140,000 represents direct expenses.

The Budget for the year 2005 has been considered in the
context of the implementation of the Bank's Vision and its
Strategic Plan 2003-2007, as well as the recommendations
contained in Management's Action Plan to Improve the
Implementation of ADF Operations, as informed by the ADF
Independent Evaluation. The preparation of the Budget was
driven by a number of decisions taken by the Boards of
Governors and Directors and Complementary Action Plans,
principally the Extended Mission regime and the accelerated decentralization program, which are embedded, inter
alia, in the Strategic Resources Framework for Institutional
Development (SRFID) initiative. The Boards have taken note
of SRFID, which is expected to have a cumulative impact in
the Bank's budget amounting to UA 51.1 million over the
2005-2007 period. The Boards will decide on the precise
level of allocation on an annual basis as part of the budgetary exercise. The first tranche of UA 16.10 million was
approved by the Boards in the 2005 Budget.

 

CONCLUSION

During the Bank Group's first full year of operations
at its Temporary Relocation Agency (TRA) in Tunis, the
institution was able to consolidate its internal organization and strategic approach, mobilize funds through the
successful conclusion of its consultations for the Tenth
Replenishment of the African Development Fund, reactivate its staff recruitment campaign, and deliver on its
operational commitments and development mandate
vis-a-vis its regional member countries. In this regard,
Bank Group total approvals in 2004 amounted to UA
2.79 billion compared to UA 1.77 billion in the previous
year, representing an increase of 57.8 percent.

In particular, lending and grant operations from the ADF
window registered a sharp increase owing to increased
approvals for infrastructural initiatives and to the multisector, and as a result of increased resource flows for debt
relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. There was also an
increase in the amounts approved for post-conflict debt relief
grants, project grants, and technical as well as emergency
assistance. This is due to the fact that grant operations have
been expanded since ADF-IX beyond the narrower scope of

ANNUAL REPORT 2004

XXviiey) Executive Summary

project-cycle and institutional capacity building to include
broader support for activities critical for sustaining economic
growth and poverty reduction in RMCs. In this regard, the
share of grant operations in 2004 increased substantially,
accounting for 17 percent of total ADF approvals.

The financial and operational measures implemented in
the Bank Group throughout 2004, as well as the strong
shareholder support, confirm the Bank's high rating with
the major international ratings agencies. The consolidation of the Bank's organizational structure, the upgrading

a “es

of staffing, the introduction of quantifiable indicators to
measure internal and operational development effectiveness, and the consolidation of the IT and telecommunications platform, have favorably positioned the Bank Group
at the forefront of Africa's development efforts. In order
to meet the challenges that still confront the continent,
the Bank needs to become a stronger regional bank,
capable not only of providing high-quality financial and
technical support to its RMCs but also of serving as an
intellectual leader and innovator on African development
issues.TABLE 0.1

The Fortieth Anniversary CelebrationsBOARDS OF GOVERNORS

The 2004 Annual Meetings

The Thirty-Ninth Annual Meeting of the Board of
Governors of the African Development Bank (ADB) and
the Thirtieth Annual Meeting of the African Development
Fund (ADF) were held jointly on May 25 and 26, 2004,
in Kampala, Uganda, under the chairmanship of His
Excellency Mr. Gerald Ssendaula, Governor for Uganda
and Chairperson of the Boards of Governors. The
Meetings were preceded by a number of activities. The
Bureau of the Boards of Governors and the Joint Steering
Committee of the Boards of Governors convened on
May 23, 2004, followed on the same day by the working
lunch on the presentation of the Bank Group’s Financial
Situation and Operations and the Strategic Plan.

On May 24, 2004 the Joint ADB/ECA Symposium
was held on the theme “Closing the Gender Gap:
Promoting Gender Equity for Growth and Development
in Africa," followed later the same day by the launching of the Fortieth Anniversary celebrations of the
African Development Bank. The Bank Group's African
Development Report 2004 and the African Economic
Outlook 2003/4 were both launched on May 26, 2004.

The formal opening ceremony was held at the Speke
Resort Conference Center (SRCC), Munyonyo, Kampala,
Uganda, on May 25, 2004, and was presided over by
His Excellency Mr. Yoweri Museveni, President of the
Republic of Uganda. Mr. K. Y. Amoako, the Executive
Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA),
was also present. The Annual Meetings were attended by
over 1,300 participants comprising Governors, Alternate
Governors, members of the Boards of Directors, delegates from regional and non-regional member countries
and organizations, and observers from the private secto
banking, and civil society.

'

In his welcome address, His Excellency Mr. Gerald
Ssendaula extended his country’s appreciation to the
Board of Governors, Boards of Directors, Management,
and staff of the Bank for honoring his country by selecting Kampala as the venue for the 2004 Annual Meetings.
He wished the Bank continued success as it marked the
Fortieth Anniversary of its establishment.

 

In his opening statement, His Excellency Mr. Yoweri
Museveni, President of the Republic of Uganda, also
welcomed delegates to Uganda and expressed the

hope that they would have fruitful discussions and a
memorable stay in Kampala. He also expressed concern
about the underperformance of some African economies
which, in his opinion, was due to several factors, such
as inappropriate policies, poor governance, a low level
of infrastructural development, and the absence of an
appropriate legal framework to provide an enabling
environment for private sector development. President
Museveni also highlighted a number of exogenous factors that had curbed Africa’s economic growth, such as
the colonial legacy of many countries, the interference
of development partners in Africa’s internal affairs and
decision-making processes, as well as unfavorable terms
of trade. He also stressed the need for skilled manpower,
particularly in the scientific and technical fields, and
urged that such skills be adequately remunerated to
avoid a further “brain drain.”

In his opening statement, Mr. Omar Kabbaj, President
of the Bank Group, thanked President Museveni, the
Government and people of Uganda for graciously accepting to host the Bank Group’s 2004 Annual Meetings. He
was particularly grateful to President Museveni for his
continued support and regular attendance at Bank Group
meetings and functions, despite his numerous other
engagements. The President drew attention to the special character of the 2004 Meetings, which marked the
Fortieth Anniversary of the Bank's existence. Moreover,
his event was taking place at a time when many African
countries were beginning to register a marked improvement in their economic performance after a decade and
a half of reforms. He applauded the fact that most of
he countries were achieving growth rates of above 5
percent, although the continent as a whole was still facing considerable challenges in the form of extreme poverty and slow progress toward meeting the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs).

Turning his attention to Bank Group financial approvals in 2003, President Kabbaj reported that the African
Development Bank (ADB) had committed US$ 1.1 billion;
he African Development Fund (ADF), US$ 1.5 billion;
and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), US$ 33.5 million. In
addition, the Bank Group had mobilized US$ 3.7 billion
hrough cofinancing, bringing the total resources generated for regional member countries (RMCs) to US$ 6.4
billion. He noted that the Bank Group’s lending and grant
operations in 2003 were in line with the priority areas set
out in its Vision Statement and Strategic Plan, and that
those operations were based on the Poverty Reduction

 

ANNUAL REPORT 2004

Activities of the Boardsey) Activities of the Boards

Strategy Papers (PRSPs) of each beneficiary country.
The President attributed the slight decrease in earnings
to the overall low interest rate prevailing in the capital
markets, the effect of prepayments of certain highyielding loans, and the increase in administrative costs
consequent to the Bank's relocation during the year.
That exercise notwithstanding, Mr. Kabbaj reiterated
that the solid financial position and strong shareholder
support had resulted in the Bank receiving triple-A credit
ratings from all the major rating agencies. He concluded
that with the firm support of shareholders and partners,
the Bank Group would continue to make a significant
contribution to the development efforts of its RMCs.

With regard to the temporary relocation of the Bank's
operations to Tunis, the President noted that the
relocation period had been extended by one year, in
view of the prevailing situation in the host country.
He, however, reaffirmed that the Bank’s Headquarters
remain in Abidjan and thanked the authorities of Céte
d'ivoire and Tunisia for their continued assistance and
understanding.

In their respective interventions, the Governors
expressed their appreciation to the Government and
people of Uganda for hosting the Annual Meetings,
and for the hospitality extended to them and their
respective delegations. They particularly welcomed the
continued partnership between the Bank Group and the
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA). The Governors
then paid special tribute to past and present members
of the Boards of Governors, the Boards of Directors,
Management and staff of the Bank on the special occasion of the Fortieth Anniversary of the institution.

Governors observed that Africa had recorded reasonable
economic progress in 2003, as evidenced by the increased
macroeconomic stability in a number of the RMCs. They
noted that sound policies and good governance were
key factors for economic growth, poverty reduction,
and improved social indicators. Nevertheless, to address
the continued high incidence of poverty in the region,
they drew attention to the emerging global partnership for development within the framework of the New
Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). They made
a special plea to stakeholders to ensure that Africa does
not become marginalized in the global arena, particularly
in the areas of trade, technology, debt relief, and the
environment. Within the framework of this development
partnership, the onus of formulating and implementing

 

6 ™ ANNUAL REPORT 2004

ee

sound national plans for economic growth and poverty
reduction (such as PRSPs) should remain with the RMCs.
Donors, on the other hand, should use these national
plans as the reference point for effective collaboration
and to ensure that sufficient funds are made available
to allow for their full implementation. They also stressed
the importance of country ownership and consultations
between donors and recipients in a spirit of partnership
and reciprocal obligations.

On the role of the ADB Group, the Governors expressed
their backing for the new initiatives in support of postconflict assistance and decentralization of Bank Group
operations. They also welcomed the Bank's continued
focus on regional initiatives such as NEPAD, the African
Water Facility (AWF), and the Nile Basin Initiative. They
commended the Bank for its crucial role in the implementation of the NEPAD initiative, particularly in the
areas of infrastructure, financial sector development,
governance, and the African Peer Review Mechanism
(APRM). With respect to the African Water Facility,
the Governors endorsed the recommendations of the
Boards of Directors that the Bank Group should host
the Facility, establish its Fund, and administer the
resources.

The Governors acknowledged that the Bank's robust
financial performance had enabled it to establish itself
as a strong regional development finance institution and
they commended the Boards of Directors, Management,
and staff for their hard work and dedication. However,
they also noted that, notwithstanding this achievement,
both the Bank Group and the donor community face
crucial challenges in eradicating poverty, promoting
good governance, and controlling the HIV/AIDS pandemic. On the crucial matter of resource mobilization,
Governors welcomed the progress that had been made
with regard to the Tenth Replenishment of the African
Development Fund (ADF-X). However, they called on
ADF-X Deputies to approve a substantial volume that
would meet the resource requirements of ADF countries,
reminding them that the donor community still had to
fulfill the pledges made at the Monterrey Conference
of March 2002. They also urged that strenuous efforts
be undertaken to assist in the reduction of developing countries’ debts and on the lifting of trade barriers. Finally, the Governors commended the Boards of
Directors, Management, and staff for the good results
obtained by the Bank under difficult circumstances
resulting from the temporary relocation exercise.Joint ADB/ECA Annual Meetings Symposium

The Annual Meetings Symposium was held in Kampala,
Uganda, on May 24, 2004. The Symposium, which was
jointly organized by the Bank Group and the Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA), took as its theme for 2004,
“Closing the Gender Gap: Promoting Gender Equity
for Growth and Development in Africa.” Over 400 participants attended the Symposium, including the ADB
Governors, their respective delegations, as well as leaders
of the civil society and the private sector.

In his welcome address, the President of the ADB,
Mr. Omar Kabbaj, underscored that gender equity has
become a sine qua non for Africa's sustainable development. He noted that, in accordance with the principles
guiding NEPAD and the MDGs, the Bank intends to
promote poverty reduction by placing women centerstage of the development agenda. Although only limited
progress had been achieved so far in gathering data and
statistics on the living and working conditions of women,
Mr. Kabbaj stressed that achievements had been made
on the institutional front in securing the greater representation of women at the upper echelons of responsibility.
He added that the Bank is systematically mainstreaming
the gender issue in its policies and initiatives, as well as in
all the programs and projects funded by the institution.

 

In his address, the Executive Secretary of the ECA, Mr.
K.Y. Amoako, identified the inequality that exists between
men and women as the missing link in the overall development trajectory of Africa. He underscored the need
to reassess women’s position in the workplace and he
highlighted the ECA‘s efforts in this regard. Furthermore,
Mr. Amoako drew attention to the HIV/AIDS pandemic,
which is disproportionately claiming more female than
male victims across the continent. He invited the audience to reflect on the impact of the HIV/AIDS issue on
African norms and values and on the inherent risk of
seeing whole communities break down as a result of the
pandemic.

The Prime Minister of Mozambique, Her Excellency Ms.
Luisa Diogo, endorsed the view that gender equality is
vital for poverty alleviation and represents one of the
major challenges for the continent. She pointed out that
Mozambique had confronted this problem by placing
the gender issue at the heart of the Government's 20012005 Poverty Reduction Program, which has as its prime
objective to halve the number of people living in extreme
poverty by the year 2010.

Activities of the Boards

The President of Uganda, His Excellency Mr. Yoweri
Museveni, underscored the importance of tackling the
problem of wealth production and distribution in order
to resolve the gender issue in a sustainable manner. In
Uganda, the President added, the strategy for women's
empowerment is centered on the issue of school enrollment for girls, and in this respect, quotas are being
implemented in the Ugandan schooling system.

n opening the plenary session, Mrs. Gertrude Mongella,
President of the African Union (AU) Parliament, denounced
he lack of concerted action on the gender equity issue,
although she acknowledged that some institutions, such
as the African Union, are making strenuous efforts to
advance this agenda. Mrs. Mongella invited the audience
‘0 consider that the issue calls primarily for a change in
men’s way of thinking.

The Director of the Operations Policy and Review
Department at the ADB, Mr. P. Afrika, reminded the
participants that African women have been receiving less
han 10 percent of total loans and under 1 percent of
agricultural credit, even though the agriculture sector has
he highest concentration of women. He described the
measures taken by the Bank to promote gender equity,
adding that, from 1990 to 1997, Bank projects had been
specifically designed to empower women. Recalling that
women are the poorest of the poor in Africa, the Prime
Minister of Tanzania, Mr. Basil Pesambili Mramba, recommended that the proportion of resources allocated to
gender issues in national budgets be increased in order
to improve the welfare of the African family in general.
Formalizing women’s rights and providing them with
the necessary means for action are consonant with the
development process as a whole.

 

 

 

The President of the World Association of Women
Entrepreneurs (FCEM), Mrs. Leyla Khayat, outlined the
economic situation of women entrepreneurs and recommended that financing mechanisms be designed to
foster the creation of small and medium-scale enterprises
(SMEs), and to help very small enterprises to grow to the
level of SMEs. In this respect, the new information and
communications technology should be used extensively
to broaden access to the necessary information.

 

 

In her own intervention, Mrs. Annika Sdder, Swedish
Secretary of State for Cooperation and Development,
stated that the logic of economic and social development
opposes any discrimination based on gender, religion, or

ANNUAL REPORT 2004ey) Activities of the Boards

disability. In this area, Sweden has made good progress
on certain fronts, for example in the workplace, although
much remains to be done before full gender equity can
be achieved in all spheres of life.

The Benin Minister of Finance, Mr. Grégoire Laourou, pointed out that supporting the gender agenda is largely contingent on budgetary support within the PRSP implementation
framework. In Benin, he added, the abolition of school
fees for girls has boosted primary school enrollment rates.
Similar interventions have been undertaken with regard to
healthcare, access to microcredit, access to rural water facilities, etc. However, much remains to be done, particularly to
sensitize and educate men in the fight against HIV/AIDS.

The Finance Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,
Mrs. Ngozi Okonjo-lweala, urged political leaders in
Africa to consider, prior to any action, their implications
vis-a-vis gender equality. In Nigeria, the promotion of
women to strategic administrative positions has supported the implementation of reforms in such areas as
trade, revenue collection, and the fight against corruption and drugs.

The Chairperson of the plenary session, Mrs. Gertrude
Mongella, highlighted the impact of armed conflicts on
women and children, urging governments to mobilize
more resources to fight poverty, instead of buying arms.
Mrs. Marie-Angélique Savane, President of APRM's Panel
of Eminent Persons for NEPAD, lamented the fact that
most development projects do not address the fundamental needs of the African woman. She expressed the
view that the root of women’s disempowerment lies in
their precarious economic situation, and that sustainable
economic growth can foster the cultural liberation of both
sexes. She also called for a firm stand against corruption
while ensuring the expansion of opportunities for all in
the context of a well-diversified economy. Such measures,
in her view, will serve to redress the political and economic
balance at the global level, so that Africa may take its
rightful place within the global trading system.

 

Launching of Bank Group Publications

As part of the activities at the Annual Meetings, the
African Development Report 2004 was launched under
the theme: “Africa in the Global Trading System." The
African Economic Outlook (AEO) was also launched on
this occasion. The AEO is a collaborative product, jointly
prepared and published by the Bank Group and the
OECD Development Center. This publication provides a

8 ™ ANNUAL REPORT 2004

review of socioeconomic trends in 22 selected countries,
in addition to a thematic analysis, which for 2004 centered on the question of Energy Supply in Africa.

Resolutions of the Boards of Governors

During the Annual Meetings a number of resolutions
relating to both the ADB and ADF were considered and
adopted by the Boards of Governors (see Appendix A of
Chapters 6 and 7). Among other documents, the Boards
of Governors endorsed the report of the Joint Steering
Committee and approved the recommendations made
by the Committee and the relevant resolution on the
Temporary Relocation of the Operations of the African
Development Bank to the Temporary Relocation Agency
in Tunis, Tunisia: 12-month Review of the Temporary
Relocation Period (B/BG/2004/04 — F/BG/2004/05).

The Governors adopted the resolutions on the Annual
Report and Audited Financial Statements for the Financial
Year Ended December 31, 2003 for the ADB, ADF, NTF,
and the Special and Trust Funds. They noted with appreciation the unqualified opinion that the Independent
Auditors had issued on the audited financial statements,
notwithstanding the difficult circumstances related to
the temporary relocation of the Bank to Tunis in February
2003. They congratulated the Boards of Directors,
Management, and staff on these results. They also
approved the designation of Members of the Bureau and
the Joint Steering Committee from the period end-2004
Annual Meetings to end-2005 Annual Meetings. The
Bureau will comprise Nigeria as Chair, with Korea and
Eritrea as the first and second Vice-Chairs respectively.
Over the same period, the Joint Steering Committee will
comprise Benin, Canada, Chad, China, Denmark, Egypt,
Ghana, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe.

Further, the Governors approved the relevant resolution
for allocating the Bank's 2003 net income of UA 117.4
million or operating income of UA 178.3 million (without
IAS 39 adjustments) as follows: UA 53.6 million to the
DRC Special Account; UA 6.0 million to the Enhanced
HIPC Initiative; UA 45.0 million as first installment of the
Bank’s share of UA 100 million for the PCCF; UA 10.0
million as the third and final installment to ADF-IX; UA
2.7 million for transfer to reserves, representing residual
operating income of UA 63.7 million less IAS 39 unrealized valuation net loss of UA 60.9 million.

The Governors expressed satisfaction with the measures
the Bank has put in place over the past few years to curbarrears in order to reduce the level of non-accruals. These
measures have included imposing sanctions on countries
falling into arrears by suspending the granting or signing
of any new loans, non-disbursement of any Bank Group
loans previously granted to the borrower, as well as the
suspension of identification or appraisal missions to
countries in non-accrual status. At year-end 2004, all the
11 RMCs in conflict or emerging from conflict, excluding
the multinational and very small projects, accounted for
over 98 percent of the outstanding arrears (see Table
1.1). Among these post-conflict RMCs, the Boards have
already approved the PCCF arrears clearance programs
for Burundi and Congo Republic.

BOARDS OF DIRECTORS

Throughout the year, the Boards of Directors provided
guidance and direction on operational, financial, and corporate governance issues as they considered policies and
guidelines, country strategy papers, projects and program
loans, debt relief operations, and technical assistance
grants for all Bank Group activities.

The Temporary Relocation of the Bank Group

During the year, the Boards of Directors discussed and
approved proposals on the context of the Extended
Mission Regime of the Temporary Relocation of the Bank
in Tunis. In addition, the Boards approved the necessary
supplementary budgets to cover the additional operational costs related to the Extended Mission Regime.

Activities of the Boards

In line with the Board of Governors’ Resolution B/
BG/2003/04, which requires the Board of Directors to
review the situation in the Host Country of the Bank and
submit 6-monthly reports to the Board of Governors, the
Boards of Directors submitted the following recommendations, which were approved by the Boards of Governors
during the 2004 Annual Meetings. It was agreed that:

(i) The Headquarters of the Bank will remain in Abidjan,
Céte d'Ivoire;

(ii) The situation in the Host Country of the Headquarters
is not yet conducive for a return of the operations of
he Bank to its Headquarters;

(iii) The next substantive review of the temporary relocation period will be conducted by the Board of
Governors during the 2005 Annual Meetings;

(iv) The Board of Directors will continue to conduct the
6-monthly comprehensive review of the situation in
he host country to assess whether it is conducive
‘or the return of the operations of the Bank to its
Headquarters and, on the basis of such review,
convene a meeting of the Governors’ Consultative
Committee (GCC), when necessary; and

(v) The one-year notice period for the return of the operaions of the Bank to its Headquarters will be main‘ained to allow for an orderly and planned return.

ational effectiveness of the Bank. In considering policies
and projects, the Boards were guided by the 2003-2007
Strategic Plan as well as the subsequent 2003 Annual
Review of the Strategic Plan. The Boards also approved the
operational lending target of UA 2.23 billion.

Of the 17 Board Committee meetings, 6 were held by the
Committee on Operations and Development Effectiveness
(CODE), 7 by the Audit and Finance Committee (AUFI), 2
by the Committee on Administrative Affairs and Human
Resource Policy Issues (CAHR), and 2 by the Committee
on Administrative Matters (AMBD). During these meetings, in addition to considering for approval various policies and guidelines, the Boards examined a wide range
of issues related both to Bank Group operations in the
RMCs and to its internal activities. Some of the main
issues considered at these Board Committee meetings
are summarized below (see section “Other Activities of
the Boards of Directors”).

POLICIES AND STRATEGIES FOR BANK
GROUP OPERATIONS

During the year 2004 the Boards approved a number
of policies, guidelines, and strategic initiatives aimed at

TABLE 1.2

strengthening the effectiveness of Bank Group's operations (see Table 1.2). The key operational policy approvals
are outlined below.

Bank Group Policy on the Environment

In February 2004 the Boards approved the Bank Group
Policy on the Environment, which redefines the Bank
Group's approach to environmentally sustainable development in Africa. The policy assesses environmental
constraints and opportunities that affect medium- and
long-term development objectives across the continent
and seeks to integrate social, economic, and environmental objectives rather than protecting and conserving the
environment solely for its own sake. The policy recognizes
that economic growth will be the main engine of sustainable development, and seeks to ensure its sustainability
by preserving and enhancing the ecological capital that
nurtures such growth. In particular, the policy aims to:

¢ Mainstream environmental sustainability considerations in all of the Bank's operations;

e Strengthen existing environmental assessment procedures and develop new environmental management
tools;

e Assist RMCs to build adequate human and institutional
capacity to handle environmental management;

information; and

e |mprove the monitoring and evaluation of Bank
operations.

The policy takes account of the Bank's role as an executing agency of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and
accords a high priority to measures that seek to combat
desertification.

Bank Group Policy on Disclosure of Information
The Boards approved the Bank Group Policy on Disclosure
of Information in March 2004. This is a revised version of
an earlier Bank Group policy that had been approved in
December 1997. The objective of the revision is to promote broader stakeholder participation and to provide
for the disclosure of Bank Group documents, consonant
with the Bank’s legal provisions and the best practices of
other MDBs. The revised policy aims to:

e Expand the scope and type of information for public
disclosure;

e Incorporate changes in the Bank Group's lending
activities and in new documents not explicitly covered
by the 1997 policy;

e Harmonize the Bank Group's approach with those of
sister institutions; and

e Increase transparency vis-a-vis the Bank's activities,
in line with a request from ADF Deputies during the
ADF-X Replenishment consultations.

The policy covers public documents that relate to the
Bank Group’s own operations, financial information and
institutional information. The new policy recognizes that
increased availability of information will promote a better
understanding of the Bank's development agenda and
should heighten support for the Bank's operations and
objectives.

Bank Group Policy on Poverty Reduction

The Boards approved the Bank Group Policy on Poverty
Reduction in February 2004. The policy reaffirms the
commitment of the Bank to its overarching goal of
poverty reduction and underscores support for national
ownership, participation, and results orientation in the
drive to improve the living conditions of Africa’s poor. The
main objective of the policy is to provide a framework for

Activities of the Boards

action by placing poverty reduction at the center of Bank
support to its RMCs. This will entail the integration of a
poverty perspective throughout Bank Group activities and
the development of appropriate operational mechanisms
and institutional arrangements.

The concept of poverty has expanded, as has the range
of policy options to reduce it. Issues of good governance,
empowerment, and sustainable livelihoods now feature
prominently in the poverty agenda, as do measures to
reduce vulnerability and inequality. The policy paper
explicitly links poverty reduction to governance reforms,
environmental protection, and reduction in inequality
and exposure to vulnerability.

Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative:
Framework for Implementation

The Boards approved, in March 2004, the Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative: Framework for
Implementation. Within the context of the Bank Group's
Strategic Plan, and in response to the Africa Water
Vision and the MDGs, the Bank Group conceived the
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI) in
2002. The Initiative aims to help the Bank's RMCs to
meet the water-related MDGs, i.e. to accelerate access
to water supply and sanitation services in rural Africa to
a level of 66 percent by the year 2010, 80 percent by
2015, with full coverage by 2025. In order to meet the
2015 target, a total of approximately 270 million rural
population would need to be provided with access to
improved water supply and about 300 million to sanitation services. The RWSSI was officially launched during
the Bank Group's Water Week, held in Tunis in July 2004
(see Box 4.6).

The Framework serves as the road map for realizing
the goals of the Initiative. It calls on the Bank Group to
mobilize support and resources through the building of
partnerships with donors, governments, and communities. Under the Framework, it is estimated that additional
investments of up to US$ 15 billion will be required, in
order to attain the projected 80 percent access to water
supply and sanitation by the year 2015. The Bank is
expected to mobilize approximately 30 percent of the
overall requirements, which represents an investment of
about US$ 360 million per year.

African Development Bank Policy on Guarantees
In March 2004 the ADB Board approved the Bank

ANNUAL REPORT 2004ey) Activities of the Boards

Policy on Guarantees. The policy is built on the lessons
learned during the pilot phase (2000-2002), when the
Board approved a framework to guide the issuance of
Bank guarantees, and requested the preparation of a
comprehensive follow-up policy document. The policy
outlines the principles and modalities to guide the use of
Bank guarantees in order to mobilize additional financial
resources for member countries. By covering risks that
the market is not able to bear or adequately evaluate, the
Bank's guarantee can attract new sources of financing,
reduce financing costs, and extend maturities. Principally,
the Bank's objective is to cover risks that it is uniquely
positioned to bear, given its international financial standing, credit experience with African countries, and special
relationships with governments.

Guidelines for Preventing and Combating
Corruption and Fraud in Bank Group Operations
The Boards approved, in March 2004, the Guidelines for
Preventing and Combating Corruption and Fraud in Bank
Group Operations, which articulate the Bank’s commitment to fighting corruption in its operations and to promoting a culture of sound management. The Guidelines
set out the procedures for attaining this goal by strengthening safeguards for transparent decision-making, quality
in the project cycle, and regular oversight and enforcement. The Bank's anticorruption strategy calls for effecive mechanisms on internal measures and safeguards,
coupled with a robust agenda at the country and regional
levels. The Guidelines hinge on a strategy underpinned by
he following 4 elements: (i) preventing corruption in Bank
operations; (ii) mainstreaming corruption concerns into
Bank operations; (iii) helping RMCs that request assistance
in this regard; and (iv) participating in regional and global
efforts related to corruption and fraud. This strategy builds
on best practices in MDBs and is harmonized, to the extent
ossible, with regional and global initiatives.

Guidelines for Bank Group Operations Using
Sector-wide Approaches (SWAps)

he Boards approved the Guidelines for Bank Group
Operations Using Sector-wide Approaches (SWAps) in
April 2004. Sector-wide approaches are not only consisent with the strategic orientations of the Bank Group,
ut they are also central to comprehensive development
strategies of RMCs, as outlined in their PRSPs.

 

As part of the drive to increase the Bank's development
effectiveness, the Guidelines explicitly direct the use of
SWAps in the implementation of poverty reduction strat
12 ™~ ANNUAL REPORT 2004

ee

egies in RMCs. SWAps are one of the key instruments
for forging strong donor coordination, building country
ownership, and improving the allocation and utilization
of government and donor resources. Successful implementation of SWAps may entail pragmatic adjustment
and adaptation of the Bank's internal policies, procedures, and institutional arrangements.

Guidelines for Development Budget Support
Lending (DBSL)

In April 2004 the Boards endorsed the Guidelines for
Development Budget Support Lending (DBSL). The primary objectives of the Guidelines are to disseminate the
concept of DBSL and its key features, and to set out the
principal conditions under which the Bank Group might
use DBSL as an intervention instrument. To this end,
guidance is provided on how to identify, prepare, and
appraise DBSL operations in accordance with the Bank
Group's standard review process, and follow its implementation in partnership with the recipient country. The
Guidelines have been prepared to respond to the specific
request of the ADF-IX Deputies.

The Bank's participation in DBSL operations would depend,
among other things, on its assessment of the status of
the key defining imperatives, namely: the existence of a
government-led and coordinated comprehensive PRSP or
NDP; a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) with
adequate and transparent fiduciary controls; prioritized
pro-poor development strategies and action plans, both at
macroeconomic and sector levels; and viable programs to
build sustainable institutional capacity.

Guidelines for Policy-Based Lending on
Governance (PBLG)

The Boards approved, in April 2004, the Guidelines
for Policy-Based Lending on Governance (PBLG), thus
underscoring the importance of a policy-based lending (PBL) approach to support policy reforms aimed at
stimulating private investment and GDP growth. With
PBL, governments rely less on direct actions and more
on policy and incentive changes to improve public sector performance and to stimulate public and private
initiatives to hasten economic development. The evolution of the PBL aid instrument has seen an expansion of
the breadth of policy coverage, from macro stabilization
issues to trade, monetary, and fiscal policies, and to private and financial sector reforms. This evolution is now
being extended to Policy-Based Lending on Governance
(PBLG).The primary objective of the Guidelines is to familiarize
Bank staff with the concept of PBLG, including the major
preconditions under which the Bank Group might use
such an intervention instrument. The Guidelines provide
direction on how to identify, prepare, and appraise PBLG
in accordance with the Bank Group's standard review
process and how to monitor its implementation in partnership with the recipient country. The Guidelines allow
the Bank to take a lead role in Africa for the design and
implementation of PBLG.

Bank Group Post-Conflict Assistance Policy
Guidelines

The Boards approved the Bank Group Post-Conflict
Assistance Policy Guidelines in April 2004, with the aim
of optimizing the Bank Group's involvement in post-conflict situations, within its overall mandate and strategic
objective of poverty reduction. The Guidelines examine
the underlying factors and socioeconomic consequences
of post-conflict situations. The framework for classifying
post-conflict countries (PCCs) is defined, as well as their
short-, medium-, and long-term needs. The Bank Group's
past experiences in this area are also reviewed, together
with the practices of other institutions in post-conflict
situations. Furthermore, the Guidelines identify the key
criteria for Bank engagement in post-conflict situations;
the priority areas of support; programming tools, resources and instruments; as well as procedures, institutional,
and implementation arrangements.

Bank Group support will target the provision of basic
social and economic infrastructure; reconstruction and
rehabilitation; institutional reform and capacity building;
and the promotion of good governance. The Bank's postconflict assistance will also take into account the regional
dimension of conflicts, and will promote political, economic, and social cohesion among neighbors through its
regional integration and governance policies.

Proposal for the Hosting of the African Water
Facility (AWF)

The Boards of Directors approved, in May 2004, the
Management Proposal on Hosting the African Water
Facility and transmitted it to the Board of Governors for
their approval. This followed the endorsement by the
African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) at their
meeting in Cairo, Egypt, in February 2003, of the plan to
establish the African Water Facility and their subsequent
request for the Bank Group to host it.

 

A jes of the Boards

The overriding goal of the Facility is to contribute to the
efforts to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development in Africa by (i) expanding the capacity of Africa to
access existing and future financing sources for water and
(ii) improving the efficiency in the use of such resources.
The objectives of the Facility focus on the enabling environment and water resources management so as to attract
the requisite massive investments. In this connection, the
Facility will establish the framework for mobilizing financial
resources to establish grants in support of water-related
programs and projects. The Facility will also assist in the
implementation of the Bank's Integrated Water Resources
Management (IWRM) Policy, RWSSI, and the NEPAD
Water Program. It will also support the advancement of
the MDGs and respond to the recommendations of the
Camdessus Panel on Financing Water Infrastructure.

Establishment of an Inspection Mechanism for
the African Development Bank

The Boards approved, in June 2004, the enabling Resolution
and the draft Operating Rules and Procedures for the
establishment of an Inspection Mechanism. The Mechanism
permits a fair hearing for any individual or group of people
who may have cause to feel that they have been adversely
affected by Bank Group’s non-compliance with its applicable policies and procedures. This new instrument is consistent with the Bank Group's Policy on Good Governance and
its Guidelines for Combating Corruption and Fraud in Bank
Operations; furthermore, it complements the Bank Group's
Information Disclosure Policy.

The Inspection Mechanism is independent of the other
departments within the Bank Group and has the authority to conduct preliminary investigations to determine the
eligibility of a complaint and to carry out a mediation
exercise. The structure of the Mechanism consists of a
Compliance Review and Mediation Unit (CRMU) as the
focal unit within the Bank Group and a roster of experts
(the “Roster”) who will undertake Compliance Reviews.
The Boards are the sole decision-making authority on
the terms of reference for a Compliance Review and
on the appointment of the Panel of Experts to conduct
the Review. Each year, an annual report covering the
Mechanism’s activities during the preceding year will be
prepared and published.

Bank Group Guidelines on Communicable
Diseases

The Boards approved, in July 2004, the Bank Group
Guidelines on Communicable Diseases. The Guidelines

ANNUAL REPORT 2004

G3ey) Activities of the Boards

acknowledge that the prevention and control of communicable diseases represent an institutional priority, given
their increased impact on the socioeconomic development of RMCs. As evidenced in the MDGs agenda, the
subject of communicable diseases is inextricably linked
to poverty reduction and to sustainable development in
general. The Guidelines build on the Health Sector Policy
and on the recently agreed strategies on HIV/AIDS (2001)
and on malaria (2002) for the prioritization of Bank
Group responses.

he Bank’s approach in communicable diseases conrol is to promote greater selectivity in operations and
strengthen partnerships with specialized agencies and
other bilateral partners. The Bank will prioritize: first, the
igh mortality diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and
uberculosis; second, the neglected but economically
costly diseases; and third, the emerging and epidemicrone diseases. The areas of interventions in communicable diseases control, in accordance with the specified
riorities, are as follows: (i) prevention of diseases; (ii)
care and treatment; (iii) capacity building in RMCs; (iv)
infrastructure support; and (v) impact mitigation. Within
his framework, the Guidelines encourage and support
ublic-private partnerships (PPPs) in scaling-up communicable disease control activities in RMCs, particularly in
he non-concessional ADB group of countries.

The Private Sector Development Strategy

n December 2004 the Boards approved the Private
Sector Development Strategy of the African Development Bank Group. Development of the private sector is
essential for effective poverty reduction and sustainable
economic development and, as such, is a key component
of the Bank’s Vision and Strategic Plan. The Bank’s Private
Sector Development (PSD) Strategy focuses on creating
the conditions and building the capacities (i.e., institutional, human, legal, and governance structures) needed
to attract investment in the private sector. The Strategy is
consistent with the 3 pillars of the Bank's Strategic Plan,
namely, (i) ownership of the private sector development
process by the country, (ii) partnership with development
partners and other economic operators, and (iii) selectivity
in sectors of interventions, as defined in the Bank’s CSPs,
based on country needs as confirmed in the country’s
PRSP. The PSD Strategy acknowledges the specificities of
each country and responds in a manner appropriate to
the circumstances, placing different emphasis on: (i) public sector lending to create an enabling environment, (ii)
public-private partnerships to encourage privatization of

 

14 ™ ANNUAL REPORT 2004

ee

public utilities and other industries, and (iii) purely private
sector lending, with an emphasis on financial intermediaries and risk mitigation.

FINANCE-RELATED POLICIES AND
GUIDELINES

During the year the Boards approved 2 main finance-related policy documents: The Review of the ADF Currency
Risk Contingency Reserve and Bank Group Post-Conflict
Assistance Guidelines - Arrears Clearance Framework.
The Boards also approved the 2005 Administrative
Expenses and Capital Expenditures Budgets and the Year
2005 Borrowing Program, as detailed below.

Review of the ADF Currency Risk Contingency
Reserve

The Board approved, in May 2004, the Review of the ADF
Currency Risk Contingency Reserve as part of a periodic
review of the required level of contingency reserve to
protect the Fund from overcommitting its resources.
The possibility of the Fund’s undisbursed commitments
exceeding the amount of available resources poses a significant risk because of exchange rate movements.

To mitigate the risk of overcommitment, the ADF seeks
to match the currency composition of its net development resources with the UA. In 1999, the Fund's Board
approved a contingency reserve to cushion against
potential exchange rate effects equal to 6 percent of net
development resources. In 2002, the Board approved
a downward revision; and in their 2004 review, the
ADF Board of Directors approved a further reduction
of the currency contingency reserve to 1 percent of
net development resources (NDR). This is to reflect
the reduced exchange rate exposure resulting from
progressive implementation of the currency matching
strategy. Reducing the contingency reserve to 1 percent
of NDR will immediately release about UA 40 million of
additional commitment capacity, while continuing to
maintain an adequate level of protection from adverse
currency movements.

Bank Group Post-Conflict Countries Arrears
Clearance Framework

The Boards approved the Post-Conflict Countries Arrears
Clearance Framework in June 2004. The policy is
founded on the principle that a comprehensive arrears
clearance framework will serve the Bank better thanhandling this issue on a purely ad hoc basis. The policy
also clarifies for all stakeholders involved in arrears clearance operations the parameters for Bank Group interventions, and it signals the Bank Group's willingness to
devise innovative measures to address the urgent needs
of RMCs.

The Post-Conflict Countries Arrears Clearance Framework
will help these post-conflict countries to re-engage with
the international finance institutions (IFls) and the donor
community generally, and to access debt relief under
the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. Resources used to assist
PCCs to clear arrears and qualify for HIPC debt relief
will count as contributions to the HIPC debt relief initiative. Upon the agreement of an arrears clearance program, the ADF will provide grant financing for special
technical assistance, and the Bank Group will endorse
further steps in the re-engagement program. Access to
full ADF resources would be restored upon completion
of the arrears clearance program. PCC arrears clearance programs mobilize resources from 3 sources: the
beneficiary country, donors, and the Bank Group. The
Bank Group's assistance is channeled through a legally
autonomous Post-Conflict Countries Facility (PCCF)
under the auspices of the ADF. Eligibility for an arrears
clearance program under the framework is subject to
strict conditions.

The 2005 Administrative Expenses and Capital
Expenditure Budget

In December 2004 the Boards of Directors approved
for the year 2005, an Administrative Expenses Budget
of UA 165.50 million, a Capital Expenditure Budget of
UA 7.00 million, and a Contingency Budget of UA 1.65
million. The ADF Board approved an indicative administrative budget of the Fund for the financial year ending
December 31, 2005 for the amount of UA 124.9 million,
of which UA 124.7 million is a management fee and UA
140,000 represents direct expenses.

The preparation of the 2005 Budget has been guided
by the need to reform the budgetary process to ensure
that it is resource-based and responsive to the imperatives of accountability. The preparation of the Budget
was driven by a number of decisions taken by the Boards
of Governors and Directors and Complementary Action
Plans, principally the Extended Mission regime and
the accelerated decentralization program, as embedded
in the Strategic Resources Framework for Institutional
Development (SRFID) initiative. The Boards have taken

note of the SRFID, which is expected to have a cumulative
impact in the Bank's budget amounting to UA 51.1 million over the 2005-2007 period. The Boards will decide
on the precise level of allocation on an annual basis as
part of the budgetary exercise. The first tranche of UA
16.10 million was approved by the Boards in the 2005
Budget.

Year 2005 Borrowing Program

The Bank's 2005 Borrowing Program for up to UA
550.0 million was prepared and presented to the ADB
Board in November 2004 and subsequently considered
and approved by the Board of Directors in December
2004. The Board authorized the President to enter
into equivalent exchange arrangements with any reputable counterparts in connection with the proceeds, the
principal amount, the interest rate, and the maturity
structure of each borrowing under this Program. The
proposed Borrowing Program will ensure that the Bank
has sufficient liquidity to meet its cashflow requirements
and will enable the Bank to maintain a regular flow of
LIBOR-based funds for its clients. The execution of the
2005 Borrowing Program aims at providing cost-effective
funding so that the Bank can provide resources to clients
at the most competitive levels.

APPROVALS

The Bank Group continued to finance development
rojects and programs to promote sustainable economic
growth and poverty reduction in its RMCs. During 2004
he Boards approved loans, grants, and HIPC debt relief
amounting to UA 2.79 billion, of which UA 1.26 billion
came from the ADF, UA 1.52 billion from the ADB, and
UA 9.25 million from the NTF. The approvals covered
124 operations, including: 33 project loans and one sec‘or investment and rehabilitation loan (all to the public
sector); 5 lines of credit (4 to the private sector); 13
olicy-based operations (2 sector adjustment loans and
11 structural adjustment loans); 1 private equity particiation; 60 grants (21 project grants, 33 technical assisance grants, and 6 approvals for emergency assistance
rom the Special Relief Fund to address the impacts of
natural calamities). In addition, 2 grants were approved
‘or post-conflict debt relief; as well as 9 HIPC debt relief
operations in 5 countries, of which 4 came from the ADB
window and 5 from the ADF window.

POLICIES FOR HUMAN RESOURCES
MANAGEMENT

During the year under review, the Boards approved one
main policy for human resources management, namely,
the Staff Retirement Plan Benefits Reforms Proposal.

Staff Retirement Plan Benefits Reforms Proposal
The Board of Directors approved, in November 2004, the
Staff Retirement Plan Benefits Reforms Proposal, which
is due to become effective on January 1, 2005. The
reforms can be categorized under 3 broad headings: (i)
clarification and definition of the legal nature of the Staff
Retirement Plan, including the Bank’s obligation toward
it; (li) increased transparency of the Plan by addressing
some weak or unclear points in the Rules; and (iii) harmonization of the Rules of the SRP with those of the Human
Resources Management, resulting in more flexibility in
he administration of the pension benefits.

he SRP reforms improve the guarantees of the pension plan, eliminate discrimination, and give flexibility to
articipants regarding their choice of benefits. Above all,
y ensuring that the Bank staff have an adequate and
rotected retirement income, the approved plan bolsters
he Bank's competitiveness as an employer of choice
among MDBs. These improvements also pave the way
or establishing pension transfer agreements between
he Bank and its sister organizations.

 

 

OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE BOARDS OF
DIRECTORS

In addition to the activities undertaken in the formal
sessions, the Boards of Directors carried out a number
of functions through the various Committees of the
Boards. These include: the Committee on Administrative
Matters Concerning the Boards of Directors (AMBD); the
Audit and Finance Committee (AUFI); the Committee on
Administrative Affairs and Human Resource Policy Issues
(CAHR); the Committee on Operations and Development
Effectiveness (CODE); as well as the Joint Committee on
Operations and Development Effectiveness and Audit
and Finance (CODE/AUFI). There is also the Committee of
the Whole (CoW), chaired by the Bank President, which
includes all the Executive Directors and which reviews the
Bank Group annual budget and any other matters referred
to it on an ad hoc basis by the Boards. During the year
2004, the Committees of the Boards held a total of 17

16 ™ ANNUAL REPORT 2004

ee

meetings to review policy papers, portfolio review reports,
portfolio performance reports, and project performance
audit reports, in addition to regular administrative matters.
Highlights of these meetings are presented below.

Committee on Administrative Matters
Concerning the Boards of Directors (AMBD)

The AMBD Committee held 2 meetings in May and
October 2004 to consider, inter alia, specific internal
issues pertaining to administrative matters concerning
the Executive Directors and staff of their offices. At both
meetings the AMBD Committee discussed the Retirement
Age of Advisers and Assistants of Executive Directors.
During the meeting in October they also considered the
election of a Vice-Chairperson and the Terms of Reference
of the Ethics Committee of the Boards of Directors, which
is in the process of being established.

Concerning the retirement age of Advisers and Assistants
of Executive Directors, the Committee agreed to convene
a subsequent meeting to review the 1999 Regulations
on this issue. It was agreed that the review would take
into consideration the views and positions of concerned
parties as well as practices in sister institutions.

Regarding the Terms of Reference for the Ethics
Committee, one issue of concern centered on the 2-year
non-renewable term for each member of the Committee.
Clarification was given that this term of office was
designed not to exceed the statutory 3-year term of an
Executive Director. The Committee agreed to convene
another meeting on the issue in the presence of the
General Counsel.

Audit and Finance Committee (AUFI)

The AUFl Committee held 7 meetings in 2004, during
which it examined and reviewed, inter alia, the following
key documents: The 2005 Internal Audit Work Program;
The Bank Group Policy on Guarantees; Quality Assurance
Review of the Internal Audit Department; and the 2003
Annual Report of the Activities of the Internal Audit
Department. The AUF Committee also considered the
Bank experience and implications of the International
Accounting Standards No. 39 (IAS 39), and approved the
Financial Statements of the ADB, ADF, NTF, as well as the
Special and Trust Funds.

During its meeting of 23 March, the Committee expressed
satisfaction at the measures taken to tighten the controls
for the Bank's transactions. It encouraged Managementto maintain the appropriate control standards in an
increasingly complex environment. The Committee noted
that it should be informed of all changes in the principles
and policies, such as the loan loss provisioning policy,
which pertains to responsibilities of the Board.

In its meeting of May 2004, the AUFI Committee discussed
the 2003 Annual Report of the Activities of the Internal
Audit Department. The discussion focused on the Special
Audit on Executive Directors’ Temporary Relocation Agency
(TRA) Related Expenses. Specifically, the Committee recommended that the Bank draw lessons from the issues noted,
particularly those concerning resources and procedures
related to the status of Executive Directors. The Committee
congratulated the Audit Department (AUDT) for the high
standard of work accomplished under rather difficult
conditions. It recalled the obligation that departments
have to process all recommendations within the reaction
and implementation timeframes. It was agreed that the
Committee would await the report on the follow-up of
recommendations made so far by AUDT.

The Committee on Administrative Affairs and
Human Resource Policy Issues (CAHR)

The Committee on Administrative Affairs and Human
Resource Policy Issues (CAHR) met twice during the
course of 2004 in September and October to consider: (i)
the Proposal to Extend the Mandatory Staff Retirement
Age at the African Development Bank and (ii) the
Proposal for the Reform of the Staff Retirement Plan. The
Proposal to Extend the Mandatory Staff Retirement Age
was considered and since no consensus was reached,
Committee members decided to refer the Proposal back
to the Board for their final consideration in early 2005.

With respect to the Proposal for the Reform of the Staff
Retirement Plan, the Committee noted that the Proposal
clarified the Bank's obligations toward the Plan; that it
contributed to the harmonization of the Bank’s compensation and benefits package; enhanced transparency and
equity of the Plan; and that it aligned the staff retirement package with those of sister organizations. The
Committee, therefore, recommended that the Proposal
for the Reform of the Staff Retirement Plan be submitted
to the Board for consideration and approval.

Committee on Operations and Development
Effectiveness (CODE)

During the year CODE convened a total of 6 meetings to
consider a number of policy documents, including: Bank

Activities of the Boards

Group Private Sector Development Strategy, and Efficacy
and Efficiency of Monitoring — Evaluation Systems (MES)
of Bank Group Financed Projects. CODE also examined
the findings and recommendations of the Independent
Evaluation Report on ADF-VIl to IX, and Management's
response; the 3-year rolling work program for OPEV; the
backlog in the preparation of Project Completion Reports
(PCRs); Project Performance Evaluation Reports (PPERs)
for Benin and Algeria; Uganda Country Assistance
Evaluation; social aspects of structural adjustment
approaches; and the Internal Audit Department's report,
among others.

Concerning the Independent Evaluation Report on ADFVII to IX, the Committee recommended that the following issues should be included in the revised action plan:
(i) the skills mix, recruitment of country economists,
and other aspects of human resources management in
operations; (ii) research issues, including generation and
dissemination of know-how and knowledge in the Bank;
(ili) issues relating to the divergent interests of RMCs and
non-regional donors; and (iv) issues relating to selectivity,
the African character of the Bank, and its comparative
advantages.

Regarding the evaluation function in the Bank and 3-year
rolling work program proposal for OPEV, the Committee

THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY
CELEBRATIONS

In May 2004, a symposium was organized in Kampala

to commemorate the Fortieth Anniversary of the Bank.
It was attended by a number of distinguished delegates,

Gzey) Activities of the Boards

among them the Dean of Former ADB Presidents, Dr.
Kwame Donkoh Fordwor; Chairperson of the Committee
of Nine, which had negotiated the creation of the Bank
in the early 1960s; Dr. Romeo Horton; Mr. Kyoshi Kodera,
Deputy Director General of the International Bureau
of the Japan Ministry of Finance and former Executive
Director for Japan; Professor Louka Katseli, Director
of the OECD Development Center; former ADB Vice
President for Finance and Chairman and CEO of the Bank
of Abyssinia, Mr. Tekalign Gedamu; and the Chairman of
the African Business Roundtable, Dr. Bamanga Tukur.

Bank Group President, Mr. Omar Kabbaj, opened the
proceedings by welcoming delegates and underlining the
critical reforms that had ensured the growth and expansion of the Bank. Several speakers underlined the critical
need for the Bank to continue to take a leading role in
African development, in particular by defining a longerm strategic vision for itself as an African institution
while working with other donor agencies and multilateral
institutions in harmonizing joint policies and perspectives.
hey also urged the Bank to sustain its expanding role in
NEPAD, in private sector development, policy dialogue,
he promotion of good governance, and the consolidaion of regional economic communities.

 

Furthermore, on September 15, 2004, an illustrious
gathering of African political leaders, together with
international and regional development experts and
artners, assembled in Tunis to participate in the Fortieth
Anniversary Celebrations of the African Development
Bank (ADB) Group. The Boards of the Bank Group
and the assembled guests voiced a positive rating of
he Bank's efforts to promote the economic and social
development of the continent. They affirmed that the
continent's aggregate economic indices have begun to
show the impact of deeper reforms. These views were
repeatedly expressed at a groundbreaking symposium on
the theme, “Africa’s Development — the Journey So Far
and the Way Forward,” which marked the high point of
the weeklong celebrations.

 

Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, Laurent
Gbagbo of Céte d'Ivoire, and Prime Minister Mohammed
Ghannouchi, who represented President Zine El Abidine
Ben Ali of Tunisia, were guest panelists of Bank Group
President, Omar Kabbaj, at the opening of the special
anniversary symposium. The eminent gathering included
past and present actors on the African and world
stage, former Bank Group Presidents, Mr. Jacques Diouf,

18 DP ANNUAL REPORT 2004

ee

Director General of FAO, and the Director of the UN
Millennium Program, Professor Jeffrey Sachs. Their statements and contributions set the tone for a day of reflection and debate on issues that ranged from the ADB's
role in meeting Africa's challenges, its support for NEPAD,
Africa and the challenges of globalization, to regional
integration and international economic relations.

The President of the Bank Group, Mr. Omar Kabbaj,
noted that the Bank had come a long way from a modest beginning with a subscribed membership of 33
African countries and an authorized capital of UA 250
million to become a highly rated multilateral development bank with a capital base of UA 21.5 billion and
global members constituted by 77 countries spanning
Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe. He informed the
symposium participants that during this period, the Bank
had provided its regional member countries with nearly
US$ 50 billion in loans, grants, and debt relief and had
mobilized an additional US$ 70 billion from cofinanciers,
totaling US$ 120 billion. In the last 3 years, approvals had
averaged between US$ 3 billion per annum from its own
resources and between US$ 3.5 and US$ 4 billion per
annum from its cofinanciers.

Mr. Kabbaj highlighted the major challenges that the
Bank would now tackle. The first was to build on its
recent achievements and become a stronger regional
bank providing high-quality financial and technical support to its RMCs. The second was for the Bank to
strengthen its capacity as an intellectual leader and
innovator on African development issues. A further major
challenge facing the Bank is to become an even more
effective vehicle of cooperation and partnership between
African countries and the donor community, in support
of the continent's development efforts.

In his contribution, President Obasanjo emphasized that
the Bank and other regional institutions have a critical
role to play in repositioning the continent for growth,
stability, development, and democracy. According to the
President, “The ADB must build new networks, empower
investors and institutions, and strengthen the capacity of
African states to play a central role in the new globalization.” He further stressed that “African countries are
irrevocably committed to repositioning their economies
in tandem with the imperatives of the twenty-first century,” noting that hopes for the future lay in rededication,
commitment, and enthusiasm for reform, results, and
responsibility.In his address, President Gbagbo stated that the Bank
had performed well above and beyond the financial
means available to it. As he reiterated, “By dint of hard
work, conviction and commitment, the Bank has made
strides that have placed it where it is today: a tool of
excellence, the performances of which are recognized
in Africa and the rest of the world.” He added that his
country has turned its back on war and that the conditions were now propitious for the Bank to return to its
statutory headquarters in Abidjan.

President Ben Ali of Tunisia, in a speech read on his
behalf by Prime Minister Ghannouchi, cited the numerous efforts deployed by the ADB in the funding of
development projects in Africa and reaffirmed Tunisia’s
determination to do everything it can to enable the Bank

 

Activities of the Boards

to fulfill its mandate under the best possible conditions.
He called for “greater emphasis in tackling the challenges
facing Africa,” such as “poverty, employment, diseases
and the digital divide.”

The celebrations from September 9-15 included a lively
presentation on the history of the Bank by one of the
founding architects, Dr. Romeo Horton of Liberia. Also
present were 2 other members of the original Committee
of Nine, namely Mr. Sekou Traore of Mali and Mr.
Mansour Moalla of Tunisia. The activities also featured
sports and cultural shows. President Kabbaj drew the
curtain on the landmark event with the launch of a special publication, The ADB 40th Anniversary Book, which
features testimonials from world leaders and write-ups
on all of the Bank's 77 members.

This chapter reviews the Bank Group’s main financing operations in the context of the Bank's strategic
repositioning. It covers the key sectors of Bank Group
cofinancing operations, capacity building and training,
mobilization of financial resources, support for debt relief
under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, and partnership and
cooperation activities.

THE BANK GROUP’S OPERATIONAL
STRATEGIC THRUST

The Bank Group's 2003-2007 Strategic Plan, which
was approved by the Boards of Directors in 2002, aims
at operationalizing the Vision Statement. Productivity
growth and poverty reduction in its regional member
countries remain the twin overarching objectives of Bank
Group operations. In this mission it is guided by a number of key strategic priorities and modalities, as outlined
in the Strategic Plan and the Annual Review of the Plan
(2004). These priorities are to:

© Optimize the allocation of the Bank’s human and
financial resources through greater selectivity in
operations;

¢ Maximize the development effectiveness of the Bank's
operations;

e Strengthen the Bank’s human, institutional, and
knowledge management capabilities; and

¢ Maintain the financial soundness and integrity of the
Bank Group.

The Strategic Plan and the recent Bank documents prepared in 2004 (such as the Bank Framework for the ADFX Replenishment, the Revised Action Plan, the Strategic
Resource Framework for Institutional Development) aim
to further improve the quality of the Bank Group portfolio and its development effectiveness. The Results
Measurement Framework (RMF), which began to be
implemented in 2004, and the Balanced Scorecard (BSC),
which was developed in 2004 and is due to be rolled out
in 2005, will assist in making the Bank a fully fledged
results-based institution.

The Bank recognizes that there is a need for effective
implementation processes and procedures in all its operations. In this regard, the Bank in 2004 prepared, at the
request of ADF Deputies, an Action Plan to tackle the key

Bank Group Operations

areas of staffing, decentralization-/country focus, and
disbursements. The actions in the Plan are in line with the
Bank's program of reforms and respond to the quest for
more concrete actions to improve Fund's operations. The
actions are being implemented at 3 levels: (i) within the
Bank, (ii) at country level, and (iii) at the level of donor
coordination and partnership with other stakeholders.

The decentralization of some Bank activities and the
ongoing program of opening 25 new field offices, which
started in 2000 and is scheduled for completion by
2006, will enhance the Bank's field presence, strengthen
dialogue with RMCs, and bolster country ownership. The
Bank continues to make efforts to improve training of
both Bank and RMC staff in procurement and disbursement rules and procedures to support a move toward
greater reliance on national procurement systems that
conform to internationally recognized standards. In addition, the Bank will continue to strengthen development
partnership arrangements with multilateral, bilateral, and
regional agencies that have a similar strategic orientation
and with whom enhanced cooperation can lead to a constructive division of labor and synergistic benefits.

The consultations on the ADF-X Replenishment, together
with the Bank Group's framework paper on post-conflict
countries (PCCs), and the ongoing review of the Bank's
business in ADB countries, have provided guidance on
the strategic priorities in the different RMC groups. In the
36 ADF-only countries, the overarching objective remains
that of reducing poverty and promoting sustainable and
equitable economic growth. This aligns with the efforts
of these countries to achieve the MDGs, as detailed in
their PRSPs. In these countries, the focus remains that of
greater selectivity in operations, enhancement of country
ownership, increased performance-based allocation (PBA)
of resources, debt sustainability, support for post-conflict
reconstruction and rehabilitation as well as arrears clearance, improved donor coordination and partnerships,
and transparency and accountability (see Box 2.1).

The operational priority areas for ADF countries under
ADF-X (2005-2007) will remain the same as under ADFIX (2002-2004), focusing on the following key areas:
agriculture and rural development; social sector (education and health); transportation; rural water supply and
sanitation; private sector development; good governance; regional economic cooperation and integration;
environment and sustainable development; and capacity
building in RMCs.

BOX 2.1
Rationalizing Scarce Resources:

The African Development Fund's Performance-Based Allocation System

 

The ADF performance-based allocation (PBA) system is a
rational and transparent method for allocating ADF resources
on the basis of performance and need. It aims to provide a
transparent means of allocating concessional resources to
eligible borrowers based on performance and need, placing
a higher premium on performance than on need. The allocation framework is based on specific assessment criteria, viz.,
the Country Performance Assessment (CPA), which is made
up of 2 parts: the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
(CPIA, accounting for 70 percent of the rating), and the
Country Portfolio Performance Rating (CPPR 30 percent). The
PBA framework seeks to achieve effective allocation of ADF
resources to countries that can use these with the greatest
efficiency; identify critical institutional and capacity constraints,
as well as policy weaknesses; and sharpen the focus on critical
areas of policy dialogue with RMCs.

During the ADF-IX period a number of improvements were
introduced in line with the directives of ADF Deputies. These
included:

© Further steps to strengthen the alignment of the CPIA with
poverty reduction strategies, particularly in terms of the
orientation of public expenditure policies to achieve growth
with equity and poverty reduction;

* Strengthening the coverage of public expenditures by highlighting cases where nonproductive expenditures crowd out
development expenditures; and

* Introducing guideposts in the CPIA Questionnaire to ensure
that the assessment is consistent across the RMCs through
the specification of benchmark countries as the standard by
which to assess individual country performances.

With respect to the Country Portfolio Performance Rating
(CPPR), the main determinant is the percentage of “projectsat-risk.” The smaller the percentage of “projects-at-risk,” the
higher is the CPPR, and vice versa. An analysis of the CPIA
results for the ADF-VIll and ADF-IX periods shows that, on
average, the bulk of countries have had ratings clustered in the
3 (unsatisfactory) to 4 (satisfactory) range.

Debt Sustainability and the PBA Framework

Another new element is the issue of debt sustainability. After
extensive inter-agency consultations involving the World Bank,
the Bank Group, and other IFls and stakeholders, a consensus has emerged on the new Debt Sustainability Framework
(DSF) in terms of the indicative policy-dependent thresholds
by which to classify countries for loan/grant financing. It has
been agreed with Deputies that the new DSF will guide the
loan/grant financing terms for ADF and other concessional
resources. Accordingly, countries deemed likely to face debt
distress by contracting additional concessional loans would
only be eligible for grant financing. By contrast, countries with
a low probability of debt distress, which are deemed capable
of sustaining higher levels of concessional debt, would be
eligible for loans only, or a combination of loans and grants,
depending on the degree of debt distress risk.

Future Challenges

At the final meeting of the ADF-X Replenishment consultations in December 2004, the Deputies stressed the importance
of transparency and disclosure of the outcomes of the CPA
exercise as a means to exert peer pressure among borrowing member countries to enhance performance and promote
good governance. It was agreed that this would support the
Bank Group's efforts to encourage intellectual exchange and
knowledge sharing among RMCs on governance matters.
Consequently, it was agreed to make the individual CPAs
and their CPIA and CPPR components fully transparent. The
Bank Group now has a simplified allocation formula that will
ensure that better-performing countries with good governance
receive correspondingly larger shares of the resources. Postconflict countries will also receive additional allocation in support of their rehabilitation. The new framework also provides
all countries with a basic minimum allocation of UA 5 million,
which will be particularly beneficial to small countries.

 

 

In post-conflict countries (PCCs), the fundamental impediment to clearing arrears is that of insufficient resources.
n response, the Bank Group established in 2004 a PostConflict Countries Facility (PCCF) to assist these countries
o clear arrears, re-engage with development partners,
and eventually become fully reintegrated in the internaional community. This will thereby facilitate a sustainable normalization of relations with the Bank Group and

 

24 > ANNUAL REPO

help the relevant PCC qualify for debt relief under the
Enhanced HIPC Initiative. In 2004, Burundi and Republic
of Congo benefited from this Facility (PCCF).

In the ADB and ADB/ADF Blend countries (Middle Income
Countries - MICs), the Bank will target its interventions
to the priority areas defined in these countries’ NDPs.
Due attention will be accorded to supporting struc-tural reforms and growth strategies and to improving
the efficiency of government spending either in general
or in specific types of public sector investments. Other
areas of intervention will be in infrastructure financing,
using innovative public-private partnership programs
that will be critical both to the implementation of the
NEPAD short-term action programs (STAPs) across both
ADB and ADF-RMCs and to the promotion of small and
medium-scale enterprises (SMEs). A high-level committee was set up in 2004 to discuss ways and means of
expanding lending from its ADB window and making
the ADB products more competitive. In this respect, due
account will be taken of the realities of the competitive
environment in which the Bank is operating, notably with
respect to the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment
and Partnership (FEMIP), which may negatively impact
the Bank’s efforts to enhance its franchise value with key
North Africa ADB-RMCs.

In addition to striving for greater selectivity in its operations at the country level, the Bank continued throughout
2004 to ensure that the overall funding of projects and
programs reflected the operational priority sectors set out
in the Strategic Plan. In this regard, the Bank maintained
its focus on the key poverty-reduction areas of agriculture and rural development; human capital formation
and social protection; infrastructure development and
regional economic integration, particularly in the context
of the NEPAD initiative. The focus on these key areas will
continue during the Strategic Plan period 2005-2007.

 

In December 2004, the Boards of Directors approved the
Private Sector Development Strategy for the Bank Group,
which supports the advancement of this crucial sector
in the continent. The Bank's interventions in the private
sector mainly took the form of lines of credit — primarily
for onlending to SMEs — as well as institutional capacity-building support provided to national and regional
development banks.

The Bank continues to promote interventions that improve
systems of governance, to mainstream gender dimensions, and promote the sustainable management of the
environment. In the area of governance, a high priority
is accorded to reform of the public sector, and in particular to the management of public sector expenditures.
Gender mainstreaming is applied across a wide range of
Bank projects with the goal of promoting gender equity
and the economic empowerment of women. In the area
of environment and sustainable development, the focus

 

has been on the sustainability of rural livelihoods that are
based on natural resources.

In line with the Strategic Plan, regional cooperation and
integration represents another major area of engagement for the Bank. In 2004 the focus has been on: supporting capacity building in regional economic communities (RECs); the development of regional infrastructure;
the creation of an enabling regional environment for the
private sector; promotion of sustainable development
at the regional level; and the fight against the HIV/AIDS
pandemic. The Bank's support to such initiatives has
increased substantially under ADF-IX, reaching UA 154
million in the first 2 years and projected to reach nearly
UA 400 million by the end of the cycle.

An ongoing major activity that has received substantial
support over the past 2 years (2003-2004) is the Water
Initiative. This ambitious initiative (see also Chapter 4),
which has received strong endorsement from the international donor community, seeks to provide access to a
sustainable supply of water and sanitation for 80 percent
of the rural population by the year 2015, with a view to
100 percent access by 2025, as stipulated in the Africa
Water Vision and the MDGs. Attainment of this MDG
will also support other MDGs, particularly in relation to
health, maternal and child mortality rates, and poverty
reduction generally.

During the year under
its leadership role in in

review, the Bank maintained
rastructure, governance, and

 

banking and financial standards, which it had been
assigned by the NEPAD Heads of State and Government
Implementation Committee (HSGIC) in 2001 (see Box
4.5). With respect to banking and financial standards,

the Bank developed a

ramework for fostering such

standards in its RMCs. The framework benefited from

inputs from the IMF and
incorporated into the A’

he World Bank and it has been
rican Peer Review Mechanism

 

(APRM). In infrastructure, the Bank has developed a

rolling short-term action

 

lan (STAP) and work has also

started on the preparation of a medium- to long-term
framework in close collaboration with the RECs and in
cooperation with the World Bank and the European
Union.

The Bank has also continued to provide debt relief under
the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and to examine possible new
instruments for debt sustainability. With the support of ADF
donors and partial financing from the ADB window, the

Bank Group has to date extended debt relief amounting to
US$ 2.6 billion in NPV terms to a total of 23 countries.

OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN 2004

The year 2004 represented the first full year of operations
at the Temporary Relocation Agency (TRA) in Tunis for the
Bank Group, after the disruptions of 2003. Consequently,
with the full resumption of activities, the amount of loans
and grants (including HIPC debt relief) approved during
he year rose to UA 2.79 billion, compared to UA 1.77 bilion in 2003 (representing a 57.8 percent increase). There
was a substantial increase in HIPC debt relief, amounting
‘0 UA 1.01 billion in 2004 compared to UA 1.85 million in
2003 and UA 451.5 million in 2002. This reflects the fact
hat during 2004, the Bank Group approved debt relief at
completion point for 4 countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Niger,
and Senegal) and approved debt relief at decision point

SS

for the Democratic Republic of Congo. Madagascar’s
completion point was approved by the IMF/World Bank in
October 2004 but approval by the Bank Group has yet to
be formalized; this is scheduled for early 2005.

The ADB window accounted for 54.5 percent of the Bank
Group total approvals during 2004. The ADB window
operations more than doubled to reach UA 1.52 billion in
2004, compared to UA 745.8 million in 2003 and UA 1.07
billion in 2002. However, the private sector window share
decreased to UA 164.4 million in 2004 from UA 205.8 million in 2003 and UA 198.9 million in 2002. In addition, the
ADB Special Relief Fund (SRF) provided emergency support
grants of UA 2.8 million to countries affected by natural
disasters, such as the invasion of the desert locusts in the
Sahelian subregion in 2004. Total approvals from the ADF
window also significantly increased from its 2003 level of
UA 998.0 million to UA 1.26 billion in 2004, which represented 45.1 percent of Bank Group operations.

 

BOX 2.2

Since 1995, the Bank has implemented a number of major
initiatives aimed at improving the quality and development
effectiveness of its operations, strengthening its financial management, and reinvigorating its internal organizational structure. At the request of Deputies during ADF-X Replenishment
consultations, and in response to the Independent Evaluation
Report of ADF-VIl to IX, Management drew up a new Action
Plan which was approved by the Boards in December 2004.
The proposed actions have been grouped into 4 priority areas,
namely:

* Improving Bank capacity and responsiveness, in particular,
in the areas of staffing, decentralization of Bank operations
and disbursements;

* Enhancing the quality of Bank operations;

Strengthening the Bank’s research function; and

* Improving development effectiveness, in close collaboration
with development partners.

The Bank has relaunched the staff recruitment drive, which
had been suspended following the temporary relocation of
the Bank to Tunis. By early November 2004, 106 new staff had
been competitively selected for recruitment. Staffing at the
professional level will increase by 280 during ADF-X compared
to the level during ADF-IX, about 50 percent of whom will be in
the Operations Complexes. The Bank has developed a Human
Resources Strategy that fosters a corporate climate whereby
all employees and work groups are encouraged to contribute

 

Action Plan to Improve the Implementation of ADF Operations

actively to the Bank's corporate objectives. This strategy, which
is under implementation, will be regularly reviewed to ensure
that it reflects key priorities and that it positions the Bank to
attract and retain high-caliber staff.

Apart from improving portfolio quality and enhancing disbursement rates through the decentralization process, another core
element of the new Action Plan is to strengthen the research
function, particularly in areas that relate to the practical operations of the Bank and its mission. Within the Action Plan, a
critical analysis will be undertaken of the characteristics of the
Bank's African character and its comparative advantage vis-avis other development agencies. Through the Communications
Strategy, which is currently under preparation, and the Bank
Group Disclosure of Information Policy, which was approved
in 2004, the Bank will also continue to consult with its various
stakeholders on how to enhance implementation effectiveness
and the development impact of its operations.

As the focus on implementation increases, the Bank will
intensify its involvement in the harmonization agenda and
consolidate its strategic alliances and partnerships in a drive to
reduce costs for borrowing countries and improve its operational effectiveness. The principal expected outcomes of this
Action Plan are improved capacity and responsiveness within
the Bank, better portfolio management and development
effectiveness at the country level, and a position of intellectual
leadership in African development issues.The amount of grants significantly increased to UA 216.7
million in 2004 as compared to UA 174.5 million in 2003
and UA 87.6 million in 2002, in line with the new policy
framework for ADF operations. However, the share of
grants of the total approvals declined from 9.9 percent in
2003 to 7.7 percent in 2004. In addition to ADF lending
operations for programs and projects, during 2004 two
grants totaling UA 41.3 million were approved under the
new Post-Conflict Countries Facility (PCCF). This was for
arrears clearance for Burundi and the Republic of Congo,
to enable them to re-engage with the donor commu

ercent of the approvals, comprising 11 structural adjustment loans and 2 sectoral adjustment loans; while 60
grants accounted for 7.7 percent of the approvals during
he year, comprising 33 technical assistance grants, 21
roject grants, and 6 special relief fund grants.

Private sector project lending approvals declined from
UA 205.8 million in 2003 to UA 161.2 million in 2004,
representing 5.8 percent of total Bank approvals during
he year. These comprised 4 lines of credit (LOCs) to
strengthen financial institutions’ capacity to provide longer-term loans to SMEs and corporate clients in order to
increase their productive capacities and export potential.
n addition there was 1 equity participation for the private
sector, amounting to UA 3.2 million. Furthermore, one
rivate sector grant for UA 1.6 million was allocated to
ATMS III/AMSCO for institutional support.

n 2004, the Bank Group financed programs and projects
in 34 countries, compared to 37 countries in 2003, many
in collaboration with other multinational institutions and
lateral donors. In approving funds for projects and
rograms, the Bank Group accorded priority to regional
economic cooperation and integration, through enhanced
utilization of its ADF multinational window. This is in line

with its commitments to promoting regional public goods
within the framework defined by the NEPAD initiative and
its short-term action plan for infrastructure. In the same
vein, it also started, in the SADC subregion, the preparation
of a Regional Integration Assistance Strategy (RIAS) to better
focus its multinational assistance. With regard to multinational operations, there was a slight decrease in approvals in
2004, amounting to UA 219.2 million, accounting for 12.6
percent of total loan and grant approvals, as compared to
UA 287.2 million in 2003 and UA 22.1 million in 2002.

Bank Group Loan Approvals by Sector in 2004
During 2004, Bank Group continued to prioritize the
key sectors of agriculture and rural development, human
capital formation (education, health, and social protection), infrastructure development, and regional economic
integration. Due attention continued to be paid to the
crosscutting issues of gender, good governance, environmental sustainability, and the fight against HIV/AIDS
and other communicable diseases. In addition, the Bank
approved substantial amounts for rural water supply and
sanitation, in support of the Africa Water Vision and
MDGs. The ADF window, which addresses poverty reduction in low-income countries in the continent, continued
to focus on these key sectors, which accounted for 68.4
percent of the total ADF lending approvals for the year.

geared toward increasing agricultural production, promoting agricultural diversification, and enhancing innovations in agricultural technologies. In addition, attention
was given to improving food security, promoting agricultural marketing and agrobusiness development, building national capacities in sustainable natural resource
management and biodiversity, as well as improving the
social and health conditions of rural populations. The
social sector operations, particularly in education and
health, aimed at increasing access to and improving the
quality of social services delivery; controlling the HIV/AIDS
pandemic; and providing support for poverty reduction to
promote the welfare of populations and the attainment
of the MDGs. Operations in infrastructure development
were mainly targeted to road development, water supply and sanitation, and power supply, as these have a
marked impact on the living standards of the rural populations in the RMCs.

Agriculture and rural development lending approvals
during 2004 reached UA 228.9 million for 13 operations,
accounting for 15.1 percent of total lending as compared
to UA 195.2 million (12.3 percent) for 14 operations in
2003. Infrastructure project lending amounted to UA
633.1 million for 15 operations (comprising 9 approvals
for transportation, 4 approvals for water supply and sanitation, and 2 approvals for power supply), representing
41.8 percent of total lending approvals. These approvals
are lower than those in 2003, which amounted to UA
673 million (42.3 percent) for 27 operations. Lending
approvals for the 7 social sector projects amounted to UA
77.9 million (comprising 3 approvals for education and 4
approvals for health), representing 5.1 percent of total
lending approvals as compared to UA 269.0 million (16.9
percent) for 17 operations in 2003.

Financial sector approvals during the year amounted
to UA 174.0 million for 5 operations, accounting for
11.5 percent of total lending as compared to UA 299.7
million (18.9 percent) for 9 operations in 2003. This
support comprised 5 lines of credit to support financial
institutions’ onlending activities to private sector enterprises, including SMEs. Approvals for 12 multisector
projects (which include public sector management, and
institutional support for capacity building and good
governance) amounted to UA 402.5 million, accounting for 26.5 percent of the total as compared to UA
123.8 million (7.8 percent) for 5 operations in 2003.

through one major sector adjustment loan, structural
adjustment loans, and institutional support for capacity
building and good governance. These loans were for
countries pursuing macroeconomic reforms, designed
to encourage private sector-led investments, poverty
reduction projects/programs, and the promotion of good
governance. For those countries that had improved their
budget management framework, the Bank Group's policy-based lending was channeled through Development
Budget Support Loans (DBSLs), which contribute to the
enhancement of harmonization and alignment of donor
assistance to RMCs.

Bank Group Grant Approvals by Sector in 2004
he provisions of ADF-IX financing policy require the
Fund to allocate between 18 and 21 percent of its
resources in the form of grant funding (and up to 27
ercent of the allocations for those low-income countries
whose per capita income falls below US$ 360) for prooor investment projects. These include projects in the
areas of HIV/AIDS interventions, post-conflict reconstrucion, selected investments in education, health, and the
rovision of water and sanitation, and natural disaster
reconstruction, in addition to institutional support and
capacity-building operations.

During the year, Bank Group grant operations increased
substantially in 2004 to UA 216.7 million for 60 operaions, compared to UA 174.5 million for 70 operations in
2003. During 2004, the ADF window grant operations
amounted to UA 213.9 million for 54 operations, comared to UA 170.9 million for 59 operations (excluding
HIPC) in 2003.

 

Grant operations during 2004 continued to focus on the
key sectors of agriculture and rural development, the social
sector and infrastructure development, which together
represented 77.3 percent of total grant allocations. The
multisector category was second with grant allocations
amounting to UA 47.5 million for 12 operations, representing 21.9 percent of total grant approvals. The grants
for multisector operations were principally used for institutional support to countries within the framework of their
sectoral adjustment programs, as well as support for the
promotion of good governance in a bid to strengthen the
Bank’s lead role in this priority area.

 

The social sector, comprising mainly health and education operations, received the largest share of the grant
allocations in 2004 with 22 approvals, amounting to

UA 79.2 million (36.6 percent of total grant approvals),
compared to UA 64.0 million (36.7 percent) in 2003.
This was followed by the multisector category with UA
47.5 million (21.9 percent) in 2004, compared to UA 7.8
million (4.5 percent) in 2003. The agriculture and rural
development sector with 13 operations received UA 45.6
million (21.0 percent of total grant approvals) compared
to UA 40.7 million (23.3 percent) in 2003. Water supply
and sanitation sector with 6 operations was allocated
UA 27.9 million (12.9 percent) compared to UA 40.7
million (23.3 percent) in 2003. The power supply sector
received UA 8.0 million (3.7 percent), transportation UA

percent), UA 9.3 million (5.3 percent), and UA 3.0 million
(1.7 percent) in 2003, respectively.

Project Preparation Facility (PPF)

The Bank introduced the Project Preparation Facility (PPF)
in 2002 to assist RMCs to undertake technical studies to
prepare projects for the Bank’s pipeline, thereby improving their quality at entry and their implementation success rate. Since the PPF inception, 8 operations have been
approved, amounting to UA 2.8 million. During 2004 no
PPF was approved.

Cumulative Bank Group Loan and Grant
Approvals by Sector and Region

During the period 1967-2004, the Bank Group cumulatively approved 2,898 loans and grants amounting to UA
34.95 billion, of which UA 1.20 billion was for grants.
Of this cumulative amount, the ADB resources financed
59.0 percent of the operations while concessional ADF
resources accounted for 40.1 percent and NTF 0.9 percent. Fifty-two countries and several multinational institutions in Africa have received funding of projects and
programs in the sectors of: agriculture and rural development (18.3 percent); transportation (16.7 percent);
multisector (15.2 percent); finance (13.4 percent); social
sectors (11.6 percent); power supply (9.1 percent); water
supply and sanitation (7.5 percent); industry, mining and
quarrying (5.5 percent); and other sectors (2.7 percent).

North Africa region (32.5 percent), West Africa (23.8
percent), East Africa (14.8 percent), Southern Africa (13.8
percent), and Central Africa (12.0 percent). The remaining 3.1 percent of the resources supported multiregional
operations.Programmed Operational Activities in 2005

In line with the Strategic Plan and the ADF-X guidelines,
the operational priorities under ADF-X will remain largely
the same as under ADF-IX. The Bank will target its support principally to the key areas of agriculture and rural
development, education and health, including the fight
against HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases,
private sector development, good governance, regional
economic cooperation and integration, gender mainstreaming, environment and sustainable development,
integrated water resources management, capacity building, and support to post-conflict countries. These areas
will account for about 75 percent of the ADF resources
in 2005.

The global lending objectives of the Bank Group for the
year 2005 amounts to UA 2.25 billion. To achieve these
objectives, the Bank has proposed an indicative work program, the cost of which is estimated at UA 2.84 billion for
2005.The programmed lending under the ADB window,
amounting to UA 1.15 billion, will be allocated to the
strategic areas in line with the Strategic Plan (accounting
for about 84 percent of total ADB operations) as follows:

CAPACITY-BUILDING AND TRAINING
ACTIVITIES IN RMCS

The Bank supports capacity-building activities in its RMCs
through various means: the provision of training; assistance to institutions; and facilitating knowledge dissemination from different sources. Capacity-building activities
implemented by the Bank’s African Development Institute
(ADI) in 2004 included workshops, seminars, and symposia. The Bank also provided support to the Joint
Africa Institute (Al) and helped to organize courses and
seminars to meet the needs of officials and experts from
RMCs. During the year under review, the Bank continued
its support to the African Capacity Building Foundation
(ACBF) as well as managing the implementation of
the Japan Fellowship Program, which is funded by the
Japanese Government. This provides 12 scholarships per
annum to young Africans who wish to pursue a Master's
degree in a field related to economic and social development to the benefit of their home countries.

Project-related Training

Project implementation workshops aim to build skills in
project management and knowledge of Bank procurement, disbursement, and audit procedures for effective resource management. They also facilitate useful
feedback on Bank Group operations as they serve as an
interface between the Bank and its RMCs. In 2004, a
total of 12 workshops attended by 401 participants were
conducted in 11 regional member countries.

In 2004, the Bank continued to support the implementation of the Agricultural Management Training for Africa
program, which is now in its second phase (AMTA Il).
The program seeks to improve the implementation of
agricultural projects financed by IFAD, the ADB, and the
World Bank. A total of 12 countries (9 in Sub-Saharan
Africa and 3 in North Africa) participated in the program
during 2004. In addition, the AMTA Coordination Unit of
the ADB is assisting 12 agricultural projects in countries
that are not participating in the current phase of the
program to organize training activities for their staff,

namely the Gambia, Ghana, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali,
and Senegal.

Development Management Training

The Bank continued to organize several seminars and
conferences in 2004 on issues related to development
management in cooperation with other institutions. The
Annual Meetings Symposium, jointly organized with
UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) in Kampala,
Uganda, was devoted to the theme of “Closing the
Gender Gap: Promoting Gender Equality for Growth and
Development in Africa” (see Chapter 1). It was followed
at these Annual Meetings by a symposium on “ADB's 40
Years of Contribution to the Development of Africa.”
Both symposia attracted over 400 participants. A second
symposium related to ADB's Fortieth Anniversary celebration took place in Tunis in September 2004.

The ADB also co-organized 2 seminars with Euromoney,
namely the “Second African School for International
Law" and “Financial Instruments and ADB Lending
Products.” The Bank also contributed to the organization of the Montreal Conference on “Competing in a
Fast Changing World” (400 participants), the Third Trade
Policy course in cooperation with the ECA and the WTO
(65 participants), 2 meetings for African trade experts
and negotiators in cooperation with ECA (150 participants), and a Forum on “Better Access to Energy for
Africans” in cooperation with the OECD (60 participants).
During the year, the Bank contributed with other MDBs
to 3 activities: a “Regional Harmonization Workshop,”
organized in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania (150 participants),
a meeting on Capacity Building (15 participants), and an
ad hoc meeting on “Volatility and Shocks in Low Income
Countries” (35 participants).

The ADB, IMF, and the World Bank, under the auspices of
the JAI, sponsored 5 seminars that drew on the expertise
and experience of Bank personnel as resource persons.
These seminars focused on a variety of themes: “NEPAD
and Regional Integration” (38 participants), “Treasury
Risk Management Tools” (30 participants), "SME
Development” (30 participants), “Risk Management for
Development Finance Institutions” (66 participants) and
“Franchising” (30 participants). The one-week seminar on “Risk Management for Development Finance
Institutions” was organized in collaboration with the
Development Bank of Southern Africa, the Industrial
Corporation of South Africa, and the Joint Africa Institute
(Al). The program, which was held in Cape Town, SouthTABLE 2.3

COFINANCING LENDING OPERATIONS
IN 2004

Cofinancing of operations continues to play an important
role in the Bank's efforts to mobilize external resources for
its RMCs. In 2004 the Bank Group and its development
partners cofinanced 31 projects and programs, the total
cost of which amounted to UA 2.85 billion, compared
to UA 3.91 billion for 28 projects and programs in 2003.
The Bank Group's contribution to these activities totaled
UA 850.9 million in 2004, compared to UA 734.1 million
in 2003, while that of its partners was UA 1.96 billion in

2004, compared to UA 2.51 billion in 2003. The beneficiary countries contributed UA 42.6 million compared to
UA 70.4 million in 2003. Multilateral partners, principally
the World Bank and the IMF, accounted for about 69.0
percent and bilateral agencies 31.2 percent of the external contribution. The main bilateral cofinanciers during

81.05 billion, with the Bank Group contributing UA 14.5
billion (17.9 percent) from its own resources. Multilateral
and bilateral cofinanciers contributed UA 47.6 billion (58.7
percent), and governments and other local cofinanciers in
RMCs contributed UA 19.0 billion (23.4 percent).

MOBILIZATION OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES

The ADF-X Replenishment Consultations

In December 2003 the Boards of Directors recommended the ADF Boards of Governors to authorize
the commencement of the consultations for the Tenth
General Replenishment of the resources of the African
Development Fund (ADF-X). This entailed 4 separate
meetings during the year, the first of which was held in
Geneva, Switzerland on February 16-17, 2004.

At the first ADF Consultations, the Deputies supported the
broad thrust of Management's preliminary proposal for the
strategic orientation of Fund activities under ADF-X, and
agreed that poverty reduction and the promotion of sustainable economic growth should remain the overarching
objectives of Fund operations. They agreed to retain the
operational priority areas of ADF-IX while underscoring the
importance of selectivity and respecting the parameters
of the agreed priorities, and asked for further clarification
in upcoming meetings and in the draft Deputies’ Report.
With respect to providing assistance to post-conflict countries, Deputies welcomed the initiative and proactivity of
the Fund on the matter. They requested Management to
look further into several aspects, including: the moral hazard issue, unbundling arrears clearance and post-conflict
assistance, and the links to the Enhanced HIPC Initiative.

34 DP ANNUAL REPORT 2004

ee

The second ADF-X Replenishment Consultations were
held in Kampala, Uganda, from May 27-28, 2004.
Ministers from Burundi, Ethiopia, and Zambia took part
in the meetings representing borrowing countries. The
Deputies welcomed the Action Plan to improve the
implementation of ADF operations in response to the
independent external evaluation, and noted that it was
ambitious and comprehensive. They asked for the following: prioritization of the proposed actions; clear indicators to assess results; and the timeframe for each action
to be clearly spelt out. They also requested that it be harmonized with the recommendations of the Independent
Evaluation, and that a revised Action Plan be presented
at the next consultative meeting. Deputies endorsed the
proposal for the decentralization of Bank operations,
but emphasized the need for a prudent approach, one
that would also ensure that the correct mix of staff was
posted in these offices.

There was also strong overall support for the Bank’s Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI) during the
Consultations. However, the Deputies stressed that the
Fund's involvement in water and sanitation interventions
at the country level should be determined through the
PRSP process and channeled through the normal ADF
country allocation system, in coordination with other
initiatives in the sector. In addition, Deputies requested
Management to develop a more comprehensive plan for
the implementation and financing of the Initiative.

Further, Deputies endorsed the proposed Framework
for Clearing the Arrears of Post-Conflict Countries. They
asked Management to make some revisions in line with
the comments and recommendations expressed at the
meeting and to submit the revised proposal at the next
meeting. They also gave a positive initial response to
Management's proposal that UA 50-60 million of cancellations under ADF-IX be used as the initial contribution of
the Fund. This is to enable the Bank to provide assistance
to the early post-conflict countries in advance of the official establishment of the Framework. Deputies encouraged Management to prepare a joint information note
with the other IFls on their coordinated arrears clearance
policies and practices, while noting that this will not be a
condition for moving ahead on the Framework.

The third meeting with Deputies took place at the Bank’s
TRA in Tunis during September 16-17, 2004. On this
occasion, Deputies firmly endorsed the revised Action
Plan to Improve the Implementation of ADF Operationsas providing a sound basis for the Tenth Replenishment.
They also urged Management to continue discussions
with the ADF Board on the implementation and funding
of the Plan, and asked to be kept informed. A consensus
was also reached on the need for an effective debt sustainability framework to help to determine the appropriate financing terms of ADF support to member countries.
Deputies requested that further work be undertaken, particularly on the thresholds and incentives of the emerging
Debt Sustainability Framework and its long-term impact
on the Fund's finances. They requested the Fund to
work closely with the IDA and IMF to ensure that a common framework be established, to reflect the specific
circumstances of the Fund and its borrowers. They also
reaffirmed their support for the further strengthening of
ADF as a key African development institution, in view of
its central role in assisting member countries to accelerate
economic growth and reduce poverty.

During the fourth and final meeting, held on December
16-17, 2004, in Copenhagen, Denmark, Deputies reached
a decision on the Tenth Replenishment of the Fund. In line
with commitments made at Monterrey, Johannesburg,
and at the G8 meetings, and in recognition of the
increased absorptive capacity of a number of ADF countries following wide-ranging reforms implemented by
the Bank and other development partners over the last
decade, the Deputies agreed on a replenishment level of
UA 3.7 billion (approximately US$ 5.4 billion) over the
ADF-X period, 2005-2007. This represents an increase of
about 43 percent over the amount of resources mobilized
under ADF-IX. The Deputies agreed that the terms of
ADF-X financing will be based on each country’s degree
of debt distress, in line with the emerging consensus
on the IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Framework.
However, a stronger emphasis will be placed on grants
for countries with a high risk of debt distress.

The Tenth Replenishment of the ADF incorporates a number of significant new features:

e The share of grants in the overall replenishment was
more than doubled from 21 percent under ADF-IX
to about 44.5 percent. More specifically, for twothirds of the ADF eligible countries (26 RMCs), ADF
assistance will be in the form of grants only, while
for 3 other countries, the allocation of grants will be
increased to 45 percent, and the remaining 11 RMCs
will receive their allocations in loans only.

e In support of the increased commitment shown

 

 

under the NEPAD initiative for regional integration,
the Deputies increased the allocation for multinational projects by 50 percent (from 10 to 15 percent
of total ADF resources).

¢ The Deputies agreed that a substantial share of total
resources would be used in support of the Bank's
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI)
in the context of country priorities.

e Strong support was also provided for the Bank's
Post-Conflict Countries Facility (PCCF) initiative by
including in the replenishment an initial allocation of
UA 100 million (approximately US$ 146 million), with
a commitment to increase this amount as required.

e Deputies also endorsed Management's proposal to
introduce an advanced commitment authority (ACA)
scheme at the ADF, as a mechanism to utilize more
efficiently the commitment capacity emanating from
“internally generated resources.”

Borrowings

The Bank strives to raise funds from the capital markets
at the lowest possible cost to support its lending activities. The top-notch credit ratings enjoyed by the Bank
enable it to issue securities at low interest rates. Its
borrowing activities are guided by client and cash-flow
requirements, assets and liability management goals,
and risk management policies. In order to support these
borrowing activities, the Bank has available for its use an
array of instruments to access the international capital
markets. These include a Global Debt Issuance Facility
and a Euro Commercial Paper Program. These programs
are flexible documentation facilities allowing convenient
and continuous issuance, giving access to a large investor
base in a wide range of capital markets.

In 2004 the Bank was selectively present in several
segments of the capital market. The Bank raised funds
through small-sized structured transactions, executed
with an attached swap, to take advantage of attractive
funding opportunities. The Bank returned to the Samurai
market in Japan through a JPY 5 billion transaction. All
these transactions were swapped into floating interest
rate in US Dollars.

The Bank continued to consolidate its presence in the
public bond markets. After successful global benchmark
dollar bond issues in 2002 and 2003, the Bank launched
in November 2004 a US$ 500 million bond transaction
with maturity in January 2010. The all-in-cost of US$
LIBOR less 20 bps for the bond issue represents the best

ANNUAL REPORT 2004a) Bank Group Operations

level achieved so far by the Bank in the public bond markets and a better appreciation of the Bank's creditworthiness among the investor community.

As of December 31, 2004, the borrowing portfolio of the
Bank stood at UA 5.65 billion. The Bank is well within its
debt policy limits. The key debt ratios are as follows:

© Total debt/total callable capital (max 80 percent):
29.16 percent

© Senior debt/non-borrowing members’ callable capital
(max 80 percent): 58.00 percent

© Total debt/usable capital (max 100 percent): 52.80
percent.

For the year 2004, the ADB Board of Directors approved
in January 2004 a borrowing program of up to UA 1.074
billion. The Bank raised UA 418 million at a weighted
average cost of 6-month US Dollar LIBOR minus 27.4 basis
points and a weighted average maturity of 4.24 years.

Local Currency Funding

The Bank laid the groundwork in 2004 for local currency
bond issues in African domestic markets. Local currency
issues are expected to facilitate the financing of Bank
operations in local currency and to promote the development of domestic bond markets across the continent. The
Bank's borrowers will gain from reduced foreign exchange
risk exposure and the economies of RMCs will benefit from
mobilization of domestic savings, better capital allocation,
and development of an efficient financial sector.

An initial assessment of the continent's capital markets
was undertaken on the basis of a set of criteria and due
diligence. While borrowing opportunities have been identified in several African currencies, following discussions
with potential investors, government officials and regulatory bodies, the progress in each currency will depend on
the set criteria. The Bank will pursue this strategic activity
in the coming years with the objective of pioneering
supranational issuance of bonds denominated in African
currencies.

DEBT RELIEF OPERATIONS UNDER THE
ENHANCED HIPC INITIATIVE

The Bretton Woods Institutions (BWIs), in close cooperation with other development partners, including the Bank
Group, launched the Heavily-Indebted Poor Countries

36 DP ANNUAL REPORT 2004

ee

(HIPC) debt relief initiative in 1996. Following a global
consultative review in 1999, which included NGOs and a
wide spectrum of civil society, the key objectives of the
HIPC Initiative were enhanced to achieve deeper, broader,
and faster debt relief and to link freed-up resources from
debt relief to poverty reduction projects and programs.
This was the first international response to provide
comprehensive debt relief to the 40 poorest and most
heavily indebted countries around the world, including
32 African RMCs.

Under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, an eligible HIPC
reaches its decision point when the Boards of the IMF and
the World Bank determine that its external debt is unsustainable (the threshold criterion being a debt-to-exports
atio of 150 percent) and should be reduced and that the
country, in addition, has formulated a satisfactory interim
r full poverty reduction strategy. In qualifying for debt
elief, a country also agrees to implement satisfactorily its
poverty reduction strategy, maintain macroeconomic stability, and undertake an agreed set of structural reforms.
Progress on these undertakings is assessed after 2-3
years. If it is then determined that the country has fulfilled these undertakings to a satisfactory level, the country is deemed to have reached its “completion point,” at
which time debt relief becomes irrevocable. The major
international financial institutions such as the African
Development Bank, the IMF, and the World Bank begin
o deliver debt relief at the decision point (referred to as
interim relief), while a number of other creditors provide
debt relief only at the completion point.

Decision Point Operations

The impact of HIPC has been considerable, particularly
for the Bank Group and its eligible RMCs. Out of the 32
RMCs that are classified as HIPC, as at end December
2004, 23 countries are now benefiting from the Bank's
debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. Among
the 23 RMCs, 11 are in the interim period, between decision and completion points, namely: Cameroon, Chad,
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), The Gambia,
Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Malawi, Rwanda, SAo Tomé and
Principe, Sierra Leone, and Zambia. Table 2.4 below provides details of the HIPC debt relief cost for these RMCs,
estimated at US$ 1.53 billion in decision point NPV terms,
and equivalent to US$ 2.73 billion in nominal terms.

Maintaining macroeconomic stability remains a challenge
for the RMCs that are still in the interim period. Of the
above-mentioned 11 RMCs, 4 are on track with theirmacroeconomic reforms, namely the DRC, Rwanda, Sierra
Leone, and Zambia. These countries have all made steady
progress in the implementation of their IMF and IDA supported programs and have put in place economic adjustment programs supported by PRGF (Poverty Reduction and

Growth Facility) arrangements. The remaining 7 RMCs,
which reached their decision point in 2000/2001, were
expected to reach their completion point in late 2003 or
in 2004, but have yet to do so. They have experienced difficulties in policy implementation, particularly in the areas of

public resource management and structural reform, political
disturbances, and exogenous shocks. Among these, 3 RMICs
(Cameroon, Chad, and Malawi) have recently encountered
difficulties in the implementation of their programs, mainly
in the fiscal policy area, and are pursuing measures to put
their economic programs back on track. Restoring macroeconomic stability in the other 4 RMCs (Gambia, Guinea,
Guinea Bissau, and Sao Tomé & Principe) will require a major
effort to address obstacles in public resource management
and structural reforms. Furthermore, creating a stable and
favorable democratic environment remains a priority in
Guinea-Bissau and Sao Tomé and Principe.

Completion Point Operations

Five RMCs reached their completion points during 2004,
as approved by the Boards of the IMF/World Bank viz.
Ethiopia, Ghana, Madagascar, Niger, and Senegal. (It
should be noted, however, that Madagascar’s completion point has yet to be officially approved by the Bank
Group; this is scheduled for early 2005.) The 7 RMCs that
had already reached their completion point prior to 2004
are: Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique,
Tanzania, and Uganda. Consequently, 12, or over half of
the 23 RMCs, have now reached the completion point
and have therefore qualified to receive irrevocably all
debt relief committed under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative.
Table 2.4 also provides details of the debt relief cost for

BN “es

the 12 completion point RMCs, estimated at US$ 1.11
billion in decision point NPV terms, and equivalent to US$
1.50 billion in nominal terms.

Grant agreements have been duly concluded between
the Bank Group and the enhanced HIPC Trust Fund.
To date, a total of US$ 2.07 billion has been mobilized
by the HIPC Trust Fund for the Bank Group to finance
interim and completion point debt relief for these RMCs
(see Table 2.5). The Bank has signed debt relief agreements with the respective RMCs, and as a result the Bank
Group has delivered a total of US$ 1.59 billion to these
countries (see Table 2.5).

PARTNERSHIP AND COOPERATION
ACTIVITIES

The Bank Group's 2003-2007 Strategic Plan aims, among
other things, at enhancing and deepening the strategic
partnerships that exist between the Bank and other
bilateral and multilateral development agencies. In line
with this objective, the Bank continued to strengthen its
collaboration with these development partners in 2004.
In particular, the Bank undertook a Trust Fund Reform
Study aimed at reviewing the key issues of management
of trust funds, aid coordination, and resource mobiliza-tion. The Bank also continued to intensify its efforts in
(i) mobilization of non-statutory resources; (ii) enhancing the leverage of the use of mobilized resources; (iii)
developing and strengthening strategic alliances and
partnerships with development agencies and institutions;
and (iv) improving reporting mechanisms on the use of
resources and enhancing the impact of trust funds on the
Bank's operations.

At the end of the year, preparatory work on a
Harmonization Action Plan, based on the inputs of the 4
working groups (Procurement, Environment, Governance,
and Results-based Management) was at an advanced
stage. This Action Plan sets out operational activities to
mainstream the Rome Donor Harmonization Agenda
within Bank Group policies and procedures, as well as in
the RMCs. It also includes the development of indicators
for monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of
this agenda. In November 2004, the Bank organized the
Second Africa Regional Workshop on Harmonization and
Alignment for Development Effectiveness and Managing
for Results in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. This workshop
was preparatory to the Second High-level Forum (HLF-2)
on Harmonization and Alignment to be held in Paris in
February/ March 2005.

At donor level, the Bank cosponsored, together with the
Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Inter-American
Development Bank, the World Bank, and the OECD/DAC
the Second Roundtable on Managing for Development
Results, which was held in February 2004 in Marrakech,
Morocco. During the year, several coordination meetings
were held with UN specialized agencies (UNESCO, UNICEF,
UNFPA, WFP, FAO, UNDP, among others) and the Bank
undertook many joint activities with these agencies, including the identification of operations in the RMCs.

 

The scope of the Bank partnership and cooperation
efforts can be grouped in terms of the following areas:
cofinancing operations, bilateral technical cooperation,
multilateral technical cooperation, and collaboration with
RECs, as outlined below.

ee

projects were in the multisector domain of water and
mineral resources development. The contribution of the
World Bank to these projects amounted to UA 455.1
million, representing 37 percent of the total Bank Group
cofinancing contribution.

Bilateral Technical Cooperation

Bilateral technical cooperation mainly involves mobilization, management, and administration of grant resources
entrusted to the Bank Group by some of its members to
support its institutional building and project-cycle activities in the RMCs. During the year 2004, a total of UA
30.4 million was mobilized from Nigeria and Canada. The
Canadian contribution of C$ 25.0 million was in support
of the African Water Facility (AWF) and Water Partnership
Program (WPP), while the Nigerian contribution of US$
25.0 million was to promote technical assistance services
to RMCs.

In the year 2004 an amount of UA 8.8 million was committed from the bilateral grant resources to finance 93
activities in areas such as capacity building and knowledge transfer, regional integration, agricultural and rural
development, private sector development, governance,
human resources development, and gender. The specific
activities financed included preinvestment studies, training, the provision of long-term experts, and workshops
and seminars.

Austria

During 2004 the Austrian authorities expressed interest in reinforcing their cooperation with the Bank. The
Bank and the Austrian Government have successfully
concluded negotiations on a new Technical Cooperation
Agreement, to be presented to the Board in early 2005.
In December 2004, an Austrian business delegation visited the Bank in Tunis. One of the companies, GEOSAT,
made a presentation to the Bank staff on satellite mapping technology for water and mining.

Belgium

Belgium approved a total of 7 activities funded by the
Fonds d'études (Study Fund) managed by the Bank. Two
technical assistance activities were funded (one shortterm public health expert for € 44,000 and the expenses
of one environmental specialist amounting to € 39,000).
The preparation of 3 gender profiles was also financed
(one study of the border countries of Mali, Guinea, and
Senegal for € 25,000, one study of the border countries of CAR, Cameroon and Chad for € 27,000, andone study of Eritrea for € 29,000). In addition, 2 other
activities were financed from the same fund: one project preparation mission to promote employment in the
Republic of Congo for € 44,000 and one study of the
mining sector in Rwanda for € 400,000.

The Walloon Export Agency (AWEX) has approved
€ 42,000 for a one-year extension of the contract of
the Operations Expert who joined the Bank with funding from the Walloon Regional Technical Assistance
Fund. The implementations of the operations already
approved by the Walloon Region continued throughout
2004.

In October 2004 a top-level delegation of Belgian investors, led by HRH Prince Philippe of Belgium and His
Excellency M. Marc Verwilghen, Minister of Economy and
Foreign Trade, met with the senior representatives of the
Bank in Tunis. Further, a technical meeting between the
ADB group and Belgium was held in December 2004 to
review current activities and to consider areas of possible
future collaboration. The Belgian authorities indicated
their wish to maintain the priorities defined in their current strategy.

Canada

Canada has approved C$ 20 million in total to the
African Water Facility, half of which has already been
made available. The contribution to institutional support is C$ 5 million and the agreement is scheduled to
become operational in 2005. From the existing Canadian
grant, a total of C$ 1.3 million was released for the
financing of 7 institutional and operational activities,
including financial support for: Bank Group case studies
on economic risk analysis; a workshop on franchising;
a study on girls’ education; a contribution to the Bank
Water Week; analysis on needs of training for OPEV; and
participation at the Montreal Conference on “Competing
in a Fast Changing World.”

Canada also provided seed funding amounting to C$
10 million to operationalize the NEPAD Infrastructure

A major area of collaboration between the Bank and the
World Bank during 2004 comprised the hosting by the

ADB of the Strategic Partnership for Africa (SPA) Plenary
Meeting, including the Budget Support Seminar in Tunis in
January 2004. At the SPA meeting in Tunis, participating
countries and organizations renewed their commitment
to increase aid to Africa and scale up poverty reduction
in the continent. For the first time African governments
(Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique,
Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Uganda) were represented by their Finance Ministers as full participants in
the SPA Plenary. The Partnership, which has mobilized
support for economic reform to African economies since
1987, is the principal forum for aid mobilization and
coordination for Sub-Saharan Africa.

Also during the year, the 2 institutions validated the
Action Plan for the consolidation phase (2004-2005) of
the ADB/World Bank Strategic Partnership. The Action
Plan derived from the recommendations of the 2002
independent evaluation of the strategic partnership,
which proposed a sharper focus and renewed emphasis
on operational collaboration between the 2 institutions
at the field level. Collaborative activities therefore focused
on, inter alia: infrastructure development, governance
and capacity building, transportation, and water supply
and sanitation. The 2 institutions also jointly participated
in implementing the good practices and principles of the
Harmonization Technical Working Groups, in document
collaboration efforts in advance of the next High-Level
Harmonization Forum to be held in 2005, as well as in
firming up country/subregional action plans.

Rehabilitation Project in Sierra Leone; and 2 supervision
missions on the Lowland Agricultural Development Program
(LADEP) and Watershed Management Program in The
Gambia and the Ghana Rural Enterprise Project. An independent consultant was recruited by IFAD to carry out an
evaluation to improve the ADB/IFAD ongoing program and
the quality of future cofinancing. Finally, to pave the way for
an enhanced partnership, the Bank Group and IFAD held a
consultative meeting in Rome during the year. It was agreed
to organize regular thematic meetings on common areas of
interest such as NEPAD, microfinance, agricultural training,
operations in ADB countries, and gender.

International Labor Organization (ILO)

To operationalize the MOU concluded in 2003, preparations were initiated in the second semester of 2004 for
the launch of consultative meetings on joint activities and
projects. Due to scheduling constraints, the first consultative meeting was postponed to 2005. However, in the
framework of this partnership, a joint ADB/LO program
to support female entrepreneurs in Ethiopia, Kenya, and
Tanzania was initiated in 2004. Both the ADB and the
ILO will seek to attract other partners to give appropriate
support to very small, small and medium sized companies
owned by female entrepreneurs in Africa.

United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)

Efforts intensified during the year to reinvigorate the collaboration between the 2 institutions in a more strategic
manner. In this regard, a technical-level meeting was
held in 2004 to identify potential joint activities in areas
such as education, HIV/AIDS, conflict management and
rehabilitation of child soldiers, child trafficking, child

2004. The forum aimed to accelerate the implementation
of global commitments for children affected by HIV/AIDS,
as outlined in the MDGs, the UN General Assembly 2001
Declaration of Commitments on HIV/AIDS, and the 2002
document A World Fit for Children.

United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
In 2004 high-level consultations were held between the
ADB President and the UNDP Administrator in New York,
as well as technical-level meetings in Tunis. Discussions
centered on the status of implementation of the MOU
signed in New York in 2001, which was designed to reinvigorate the Cooperation Agreement of 1977. Following
he Fourth Consultation Meeting in Tunis in December
2003, the Associate Administrator visited the Bank on
2 further occasions in 2004. Representatives of both
he UNDP Bureau, including Resident Coordinators, held
working sessions with Bank management and staff. The
ocus of these meetings was identification of priority
areas in line with the visions and strategic plans of the 2
institutions: namely, country-level collaboration especially
or post-conflict countries; poverty reduction; private
sector development; governance; microfinance; environment; and energy. The UNDP placed at the disposal of the
Bank a resource person for the ADB staff “Workshop on
he Economics of Poverty” held in September 2004.

Certain countries were earmarked for closer collaboraion, particularly in the preparation of CGPs, PRSPs, and
CSPs. The UNDP-GEF (Global Environmental Facility)
visited the Bank and discussed possible collaboration
on projects in Tanzania, Namibia, Lesotho, and on the
multinational program for the eradication of T&T (Tsetse
and Trypanosomiasis).

 

 

The UNDP is expected to sign a Delegated Works
Management Agency Agreement with ECOWAS regarding the ADB Peace and Development Support Project. This
concerns the Bank's participation in project management
of the UNDP country offices in the 15 ECOWAS member
states. The Bank is in touch with UNDP regarding col-laboration in support of the Mano River Union Countries
and Céte d'Ivoire HIV/AIDS Program. The UNDP Resident
Representative in Tunisia, accompanied by the Tunisian
Permanent Representative to the UN, visited the Bank to
discuss the creation of the Tunisian Head of State World
Solidarity Fund (Fonds Mondial de la Solidarité). It is envisaged that the Fund would be managed by the UNDP whilst
the Bank would provide advisory and technical support.

The ADB plans to make greater use of the facilities of
UNDP country offices, in parallel with the opening of
its own country and regional offices. The Bank is also
in discussions with UNDP to reactivate discussions on
the integration of the ADB offices and staff into the UN
security system.

United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO)

The Forty-Ninth ADB/UNESCO consultation was held in
Paris in December 2004. The consultation reviewed the
joint work program that had been agreed at the previous
consultation. Also during the 2004 meeting, the Bank
Group and UNESCO agreed to conduct a joint seminar
for their staff on the themes of ICT and distance education respectively. The planned seminars will provide a
forum for staff of both institutions to share their experiences, identify possible areas of future collaboration, and
agree on modalities. UNESCO and the ADB expressed
their common interest to collaborate on world heritage
sites as tools for poverty eradication. The concept of this
collaboration in Sub-Saharan Africa is not one solely of
conservation, but as a way to contribute to poverty eradication and the achievement of the MDG through an integrated approach. The approach includes rehabilitation
of key infrastructures and stimulus of business activities
and local community development, thus improving the
social and economic condition of the populations. It was
agreed that such an approach could be tested throug
joint pilot operation.

a

United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA)
At a technical-level meeting between the Bank and the
UNFPA in December 2003, agreement was reached on
a modest and achievable joint work program for the
year 2004. In pursuit of this goal, during the course of
2004, the 2 institutions collaborated in the following
areas: the PRSP workshop in Senegal, financed by the
Japan PHRDG; joint appraisal of an HIV/AIDS project in
Cameroon; joint appraisal of a capacity-building project
in Sierra Leone; the HIV/AIDS multinational project in the

 

Mano River Region (Cdte d'Ivoire, Liberia, and Guinea);
and the ongoing preparation of the training manual
for the integration of population variables into Bankfinanced projects and programs. The UNFPA Director,
Africa Division, together with the Resident Representative
from Sierra Leone, also visited the Bank to take stock of
the partnership. The next ADB/UNFPA consultation to
identify additional joint activities is scheduled for the first
quarter of 2005.

UN-HABITAT

During the year the ADB and the UN-HABITAT held
high-level discussions on potential areas of collaboration.
The talks focused on how the 2 institutions could move
forward on a number of internationally agreed goals,
including the MDGs and the 2002 Johannesburg Plan
of Implementation on access to safe drinking water and
sanitation, in urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. The 2
institutions earmarked a substantial amount of resources
or their joint operations. They also participated in the
special ADB Water Week in Tunis in July 2004 and initiated partnership arrangements on project-by-project
basis. An MOU is currently under preparation and is due
‘0 be signed in early 2005.

World Food Program (WFP)

n 2004 the Bank Group approved an Emergency Relief
Assistance grant of US$ 0.34 million for the flood victims
in Djibouti. As a means to expand traditional areas of
collaboration, the Bank visited WFP headquarters for the
irst time since the initiation of the partnership in 1999.
The main objectives of this contact were to familiarize the Bank with WFP programs and procedures and
‘oO strengthen the partnership by identifying ways to
extend collaboration beyond the financing of traditional
emergency operations. ADB and WFP discussed possibiliies to jointly address new issues such as school feeding
rograms, “home-grown feeding,” and HIV/AIDS programs.

World Trade Organization (WTO)

During the course of 2004 the Bank Group consolidated its position in the overall debate under the Doha
Development Round. Discussions were initiated with
he WTO and UNCTAD, for a more clearly defined colaborative effort on multilateral trade issues. The Bank
also hosted the Third WTO/ADB/ECA Trade Policy Course
‘or African Countries. More than 40 trade officials and
representatives from regional and subregional organizaions participated in the event. Discussions are underway

between the Bank, the WTO, and sister agencies on how
to organize similar workshops on trade-related development for the benefit of the Bank's RMCs.

Other Multilateral Institutions

Common Fund for Commodities (CFC)
In March 2004 the Bank and the CFC prepared an MOU
to enhance cooperation between the 2 institutions. Later,
in June, they met to exchange ideas on possible joint
future projects. As a follow-up, a Bank delegation visited
the CFC in Amsterdam in September 2004 to agree on a
work program and define the way forward in their future
collaboration, particularly in the area of commodity
development in common member countries.

European Union (EU)
n 2004 the European Union (EU), the ILO, and the
ADB Group pursued their negotiations on a strategic
ri-partnership. The MOU project was at the center of
he discussion when the ADB conducted its consultaion mission to the European Commission in December
2004. The main elements of the proposed partnership
are: collaboration on the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, PRSPs,
regional cooperation, governance, capacity building,
rivate sector promotion, and the management of public
expenditures. The project is framed by the common orientations defined in the Cotonou Convention and those
of the ADB vision (which is also focusing on governance,
he Enhanced HIPC Initiative, regional integration, and a
participative approach to the preparation of PRSPs). The
convergence of the vision of the ADB and that of the EU
should advance progress toward a reinforced strategic
artnership.

 

 

Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie

Activities between the Bank Group and the Secretariat
of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie
increased in 2004, with the Bank participating in a
number of high-level conferences organized by the
Francophone Secretariat, for example, the Symposium
on Access to Financing, which was held in Paris, and
the Tenth Session of the Summit of the Heads of States
and Governments of the Francophonie in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso. The Bank also received a high-level delegation from the Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie
(AUF), with whom a collaborative program is being
discussed.

African Capacity Building Foundation-Partnership for
Capacity Fund

During the year, the ADB Group, the African Capacity
Building Foundation (ACBF), and Partnership for Capacity
Building in Africa Trust Fund (PACT Fund) signed an MOU.
In June 2004, the Executive Secretary of ACBF-PACT led
a high-level delegation to the Bank. Discussions centered
on capacity-building issues in Africa and on the best ways
to achieve a results-based implementation of the MOU.

Arab Maghreb Union (AMU)

During 2004 the AMU and ADB explored ways and means
of operationalizing their first MOU. The MOU covers the
following areas: agriculture and rural development,
human resources and institutional capacities, private
sector development, governance, regional integration,
multisectoral issues, tourism, monetary harmonization,
and development of the financial sector (including insurance, banking, and capital markets), infrastructure (integration of the energy network, water, and transportation
management), and natural resources and environment,
including communication and exchange of access to
databases between the AMU member countries.

The ADB has developed a regional assistance strategy for
the AMU. The 2 parties have exchanged their respective
work programs, which essentially focus on the organization of joint training seminars for the RMCs. In December
2004, the AMU requested Bank technical assistance support in 4 areas: the creation of an electronic solution for
its archives; the creation of a database with economic
and social data; the updating of the AMU website; and
reinforcement of the logistical and human resources of its
General Secretariat. The respective technical and operational departments of the ADB are currently assessing
these requests.

African Union (AU)

The prevailing priority objectives of the AU and ADB continued to be: political stability, the promotion of sustainable economic development and poverty reduction, and
mobilization of capital investment from both domestic
and external resources. The Bank continued to manage
the Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and
Famine in Africa. During 2004 the 2 institutions also
reviewed the progress made on the implementation of
the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community,the Alliance for Africa's Industrialization, the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action, and good
governance.

Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa States
(COMESA)

The ADB cooperation with the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) underwent considerable improvements during 2004, with a number
of projects and programs geared to fostering regional
integration and trade among COMESA member states
as well others designed to enhance common policies in
agriculture, education, transportation, and energy. Most
ADB projects, such as the UA 5.1 million Agricultural
Institutional Strengthening and Marketing Promotion
Project (due for launch in the first quarter of 2005), targeted capacity and institutional building. Another important project submitted by COMESA in 2004 for Bank
Group funding was for the Processing and Marketing of
Leather. The Bank Group closely reviewed the pipeline
of development projects in line with overall priorities of
COMESA and the NEPAD initiative during the year.

Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)

In 2004 the ADB and ECA undertook various followup actions on the 2003 Annual Meetings Symposium,
which they had jointly sponsored on the theme “Poverty
Reduction, Social Development, and the Millennium
Development Goals in Africa.” Consequently, the Bank
continued to collaborate with the ECA in activities relating to research, and on the preparation of studies on poverty reduction programs, as well as good governance. A
number of the activities received funding from the Nordic
Trust Fund, particularly for governance. In 2004, the twin
issues of political stability on the continent and regional
integration were accorded top priority in the collaborative
efforts of the 2 institutions, with several exchange visits
taking place.

Economic Community of Western African States
(ECOWAS)

The ADB and the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) held high-level consultative meetings in Tunis from July 19-22, 2004. During the meetings the 2 institutions undertook a technical review of
ADB-ECOWAS infrastructure projects in telecommunications, energy, transportation, ICT, as well as agriculture,
gender, environment, and water resources. The meetings
also provided a forum for the first joint evaluation of
the implementation issues relating to the ADB-ECOWAS

Cooperation Agreement, which was signed on July 17,
2004. The July meetings resulted in a follow-up strategy for monitoring and reporting the activities under
the Agreement. The ECOWAS delegation included 2
Ministers of Energy from Senegal and Guinea, 4 Chief
Executives of the Electricity Corporations of Guinea
(EDG), Senegal (SENELEC), Burkina Faso (SONABEL), and
Nigeria (NEPA), as well as 4 representatives of ECOWAS
Regional Institutions (EBID, WAEMU, ECOMARINE, and
WAGPA). Following the consultative meetings, the ADB
and ECOWAS made notable progress in a number of
areas, such as the implementation of NEPAD projects
that the ADB had been mandated to undertake by the
ECOWAS Heads of State. There was also encouraging progress in the area of peace and development:
the ECOWAS Peace Fund was established in 2004 and
received the support and pledges of several donors.

Southern African Development Community (SADC)

In 2004 the ADB received a high-level delegation
from the Southern African Development Community
— Development Finance Resource Center (SADC-DFRC),
which included the Chairman and the Chief Executive
Officer of the institution. During the meeting the 2 institutions agreed to collaborate on such strategic sectors
as private sector development, infrastructure, capacity
building, development research, financial management,
as well as sharing best practices in areas such as risk
management, planning, budgeting, and procurement
policies. One major area of future ADB assistance to
SADC will be in the area of financial markets operations
as well as regional and country ratings by international
ratings agencies.

Future Partnerships and Cooperation Activities
In line with the Strategic Plan 2003-2007, the Bank will
continue to deepen its partnerships and cooperation
activities with bilateral and multilateral development
partners. In particular, to address the issue of increasing
its trust fund portfolio, the Bank undertook a Trust Fund
Reform study in 2004, which will be presented to the
Boards in early 2005. The Trust Fund reforms are expected
to contribute to improved administration of trust funds,
increased resource mobilization, and improved reporting
to donors and general aid coordination.

The orientation of future partnerships and cooperation
activities will continue to be aligned with the Strategic
Plan and the ADF-X guidelines. The Bank will scale up its
mobilization of external resources in order to assist RMCS

in their efforts to address poverty reduction and attain
equitable and sustainable economic growth. The institution will seek to enhance its aid coordination, particularly
through its decentralization program of opening new
field offices, and to strengthen its strategic partnerships
with traditional and non-traditional bilateral and multilateral development assistance institutions, RMCs, and
regional agencies and organizations.

This chapter reviews the major activities undertaken
by the various organizational units of the Bank. During
2004, which represented the first full year of operation at
the Temporary Relocation Agency (TRA) in Tunis, the Bank
consolidated and broadened its operations in response to
client circumstances and in line with the Strategic Plan
(2003-2007). During the year the Bank Group also took
account of the need to accelerate the decentralization
strategy of Bank Group operations.

STRATEGIC PLANNING AND BUDGETING

During 2004 the Bank Group's planning and budgeting
function coordinated the implementation of the Bank-wide
strategic planning process and guided the deployment of
the Bank's operational, human, and financial resources in
line with its strategic goals and priorities. Work included:
the first Annual Review of the Strategic Plan (2003-2007);
coordination of the Bank's activities; and consultations
with development partners in respect of the Enhanced
HIPC Initiative. The Bank Group acknowledges the need to
take concerted actions to help its RMCs achieve long-term
debt sustainability and, in particular, to help those RMCs
that are not currently eligible for HIPC debt relief to meet
the necessary criteria. Further work related to strategic
planning included the development and management of
cooperation and strategic partnership arrangements with
key multilateral, bilateral, and regional agencies, discussions on the implementation of the Post-Conflict Countries
Facility (PCCF), and the ADF-X Replenishment.

 

The Bank's key strategic directions in 2004 centered on

the following:

¢ Promotion of regional integration and the development of regional infrastructure, especially through
NEPAD and the Water Initiative;

e |mproved coordination with development partners
through policy harmonization and joint projects at
country and regional level; and

e Decentralization to become more responsive to RMCs’
needs, to enhance policy dialogue, and improve
development effectiveness.

In light of the expanded mandate and in response to
the need to enhance quality, client responsiveness and
effectiveness, the Bank Group is continuing to scale up
its organizational effectiveness. This will be achieved

  

Corporate and Financial Management

through greater selectivity in its operations, increased
field presence and country dialogue, aligning human
resource strategies and policies with the Bank’s operational priorities, leveraging investments in information
systems, and more effective collaboration and harmonization of efforts with external stakeholders.

Alignment of Budgetary Resource Allocation to
the Strategic Plan
Resource allocation within the programming and budgeting framework is now aligned with the major priorities
of the Bank and the commitment to scaling operations
‘oward meeting the Millennium Development Goals. The
2005 Administrative Expenses Budget of UA 165.50 million
and the Capital Budget of UA 7.00 million, approved in
December 2004, provide the necessary resources to implement the 2005 work program, which was based on the
institution's Strategic Priority Objectives (SPOs). The Budget
herefore forms part of the ongoing dialogue between
janagement and the Board of Directors on the implemenation of the Bank's Vision, its Strategic Plan 2003-2007, and
he Bank's financial outlook. The preparation of the Budget
was driven by a number of decisions taken by the Boards of
Governors and Directors and Complementary Action Plans,
as embedded in the Strategic Resource Framework for
institutional Development (SRFID), which provides for the
ollowing major initiatives:

 

e The enhanced and accelerated decentralization
program, which will lead to more effective relationships with the RMCs, donors, and development
partners, and to a deeper knowledge of the local
context, thus raising the quality and impact of the
Bank's assistance;

e The establishment of the office of the Chief
Economist, which is an integral part of the Bank's
effort to enhance its capacity to generate and disseminate knowledge on African development issues
and become a focal research institution for the continent;

¢ Participation in global and regional development initiatives as the Bank continues to be actively
engaged in several African joint partnership development initiatives including: the Water Initiatives,
NEPAD, policy harmonization, and results-based management.

¢ Consolidation of institutional governance
through the creation of enabling structures such
as the Independent Review Mechanism and the
Investigation Unit.

ANNUAL REPORT 2004

Gsoe] Corporate and Financial Management

The Boards have taken note of the SRFID, which is
expected to have a cumulative impact in the Bank's
budget amounting to UA 51.1 million over the 20052007 period. The Boards will decide on the precise level
of allocation on an annual basis, as part of the budgetary exercise. The first tranche of UA 16.10 million was
approved by the Boards in the 2005 Budget. Resource
allocations made within the 2005 budgeting framework
are directed towards corporate priorities, which will
allow the Bank to implement its strategic goals. The
bulk (63 percent) of the budgetary resources have been
allocated to the frontline themes of strategic positioning
(26 percent), development effectiveness (24 percent),
and portfolio alignment (13 percent), as these relate to
operational activities and support.

This alignment is the result of the continued efforts
toward linking the Bank's strategic planning and budgeting functions. This has been implemented through the
vehicle of enhanced Strategic Objective-based Budgeting
developed in 2004. This new approach seeks to ensure
that strategic planning, budget formulation, implementation and control, and program evaluation and review
- including the assessment of outputs and outcomes
through the BSC system and other measurement mechanisms — are fully interlinked. Strategic alignment of the
2005 Budget is assured by anchoring each departmental
business plan and cost center work program to the 21
SPOs. The SPOs are articulated around 6 major strategic
themes or perspectives which spell out how the Bank
intends to pursue its goals in its priority areas of focus,

Design and Implementation of a Balanced
Scorecard (BSC)

The overall objective is to introduce an institutional
BSC coupled with a review system to monitor progress
made in the implementation of the Strategic Plan and
to establish a framework within which to formulate
future strategic budgets. The BSC initiative progressed
in 2004 with a refinement of measurable indicators for
each of the 21 SPOs. The pilot scheme will be rolled out
in mid-February 2005 with a view to having the BSC
corporate-level model operational later in the year. The
precondition for a fully fledged BSC, capable of tracking
performance both at Complex and Departmental levels,
is the existence of an appropriate data support system
such as the SAP-based Data Warehouse (DW). The DW is
currently under development, and the first modules will
be available in mid-2005.

In the medium term, the expansion of the BSC will
continue with the integration of the tool with the DW
and the addition of other relevant indicators down to
Complex and Departmental levels. The long-term goal
remains the integration of this expanded model with the
resource-based allocation process, i.e. to align strategic
planning and budgeting and to link this with the resultsbased management (RBM) processes and activities.

RwandaDecentralization Strategy

Decentralization remains a critical component of the
Bank's drive to improve effectiveness. It is key to the
achievement of the Bank's operational objectives in
respect of project processing, field supervision of projects, country programming, and Bank representation in
key donor coordination meetings at the country level, as
part of managing for development results. The decentralization strategy and accelerated implementation timetable approved by the Boards in September 2004 envisage
that, in addition to the existing 9 field offices, a further 8
will open in 2005, followed by another 8 in 2006.

The opening of new field offices during 2005-2006 will
involve the upgrading of 3 existing NPOs into Regional
(Mozambique) or Country Offices (Chad and Cameroon;
the latter to cover the CAR also). The field offices will
gradually assume responsibility for country dialogue and
aid coordination, and will be given delegated authority
on procurement and disbursement matters commensurate with their staffing resources. Management will
establish and monitor quantifiable indicators to measure
the progress made in the size and quality of the Bank
Group portfolio in the countries covered by the field
offices.

DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH, STATISTICAL
SERVICES, TRAINING AND KNOWLEDGE
DISSEMINATION

The Bank seeks to position itself as a principal knowledge
base and research center for the continent. Its activities
in these areas focus on the generation, dissemination,
and sharing of knowledge on African development
issues. The information is disseminated externally and
internally through the Bank's website (http://www.afdb.
org) and the Bank's library service. In addition, the African
Development Institute (ADI) and the Joint Africa Institute
(JAI), in cooperation with the World Bank and the IMF,
organize seminars, workshops, conferences, and training
programs for capacity building in Africa.

Development Research

The research function of the Bank Group focuses on
knowledge generation and dissemination. It aims to
facilitate research and capacity-building in RMCs and to
disseminate research outputs through various publications, including the annual African Development Report,
the African Economic Outlook, and the biannual African

Corporate and Financial Management

Development Review journal, in addition to economic
and research papers. A further function of research staff
members is to provide Senior Management with economic intelligence and policy briefs.

The African Development Report (ADR) is one of the
Bank's flagship publications and the theme adopted for
2004 was “Africa in the Global Trading System.” The
African Economic Outlook (AEC) is jointly prepared and
published by the Bank Group and the OECD Development
Center. The 2003/04 AEO focused on the theme of energy supply in Africa. In addition, it reviewed the economic
development in 22 African countries and provided key
statistics. Given the increasing popularity of the AEO,
the coverage in the 2004/05 edition will be extended to
30 countries, with the intention of eventually achieving
100 percent coverage. The African Development Review
was published in two issues in 2004, covering a broad
spectrum of development topics.

Statistical Services

In 2004 the Bank continued to provide technical assistance for statistical capacity building in African countries
in the context of the International Comparison Program
for Africa (ICP-Africa). The methodological and technical
aspects of the program focused on the classification of
GDP components, the finalization of a continent-wide
representative list of goods and services to be priced, and
the development of price survey frameworks for data collection in RMCs. The enhanced activities included: scaling up funding for capacity-building activities in RMCs;
assisting RMCs to finalize preparations for the launch of
data collection activities in all the 51 participating RMCs;
and pilot and research studies on various methodological
and technical areas. The Bank also initiated work on the
development of an ICP-Africa user-friendly and interactive website for the benefit of the 51 participating RMCs
and other ICP-Africa stakeholders and regional partners
worldwide.

In this context, the ADF Board of Directors approved
a grant of UA 14.8 million to support the ICP-Africa.
The grant was in addition to UA 3.4 millions of in-kind
contributions provided by the Bank. The total contribution of the Bank Group comprised close to 80 percent
of the budgeted resources for the program. Other cofinanciers included the World Bank, DFID-UK, NORADNorway, and the African Capacity Building Foundation
(ACBF). The Indian Trust Fund provided resources for
the development of the ICP-Africa website and the

During 2004 the Bank continued to strengthen the internal
review process for operational, analytical, and policy documents. In this regard, a checklist of important issues and
aspects of operational documents to be examined closely
at the interdepartmental review stage was prepared, to
facilitate implementation of the new review process. The
Bank further consolidated its commitment to enhancing
development effectiveness by elaborating a framework
for undertaking Quality-at-Entry Assessment (QEA) on an
annual basis. A concept paper and manual for QEA were
developed which set out the process to be followed in
order to promote objectivity in assessments and the ensuing recommendations. The first QEA on Bank operations is
scheduled for implementation in 2005. A concept paper
and manual for an analogous framework to carry out a
Quality-of-Supervision Assessment (QSA) at periodic intervals were also developed. Furthermore, the Bank advanced
its agenda toward results-based management (RBM) by
preparing a conceptual framework for a corporate-level,
results-based framework, in line with the Strategic Plan.

Recommendations to enhance the results-orientation of
the Bank's IT system are now also under examination.
Further, an enhanced results-based Logframe (project
design tool) was developed and introduced to a few
staff. The Logframe is more explicit in its specification;
it requires impact-level indicators, identifies target reach
(beneficiaries), and incorporates risk mitigation actions
directly into the matrix.

The Bank also continued to play an active role in
the Consultative Group on International Agricultural
Research (CGIAR) system, supporting the multilateral
efforts to address the chronic poverty and food insecurity challenges that face the African continent. A
Bank representative participated in the Annual General
Meeting of the CGIAR in Mexico City in October 2004.
During the year, the Bank was nominated to a seat in
the Executive Committee of the Forum for Agricultural
Research in Africa (FARA). The Bank also serves as representative of the Sub-Saharan Africa constituency in the
Executive Council of the CGIAR.

Promotion of Good Governance

Good governance continued to gain recognition in
Africa as an integral part of sustainable development and key to poverty reduction and development
effectiveness. This is, in part, thanks to the growing
portfolio of the Bank’s lending and non-lending activities in support of good governance objectives (see also
Chapter 4). The implementation of the Bank Group
Policy on Good Governance, approved in 2002, continued during 2004 as the Bank intensified its preparation
of Country Governance Profiles (CGPs), through active
dialogue with governments and key stakeholders
in target RMCs and in collaboration with the World
Bank. Eight CGPs, which serve as diagnostic tools
to identify strengths and weaknesses of governance
systems, were prepared for Benin, Cameroon, Chad,
Kenya, Malawi, Mauritania, Senegal, and Swaziland
in 2004. A further 10 are planned for 2005. This was
complemented by work on strengthening financial and
corporate governance.

At the level of external partnerships, the Bank continued its collaboration with the Economic Commission
for Africa (ECA) and the African Union (AU) in organizing the Fourth African Development Forum (ADFIV) in October 2004 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This
was preceded by the publication of a joint African
Governance Report by the ECA and the Bank, which
aims to measure and monitor good governance in 28
African countries. The Bank is supporting the revival of
the African Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions
(AFROSAI) and has been instrumental in the relaunching
of AFROSAI-Francophone (AFROSAI-F).

The Bank continued to mainstream governance concerns

into Bank Group operations. During 2004 a significantly
increased number of Bank operations compared to previ

ous years supported; (i) reforms of public enterprises,
decentralization, and institutional capacity building; (ii)
the participation of civil society organizations; and (iii)
the fight against corruption. Such an approach was
developed in countries such as Burundi, Madagascar, and
Malawi. Technical assistance for capacity building and the
promotion of good governance was also supported in a
number of RMCs, including Congo, Mali, and Uganda.

Microfinance

The main thrust of Bank work in this area in 2004
was geared to implementing the document, Business
Plan: Mainstreaming Microfinance into Bank Group
Operations, as approved by the Boards in 2003. Specific
activities included: a microfinance portfolio clean-up;
preparing the groundwork for policy and strategic orientation toward internationally accepted standards and
principles of microfinance; the recruitment of qualified
microfinance specialists; and consolidating external partnerships with key bilateral and multilateral institutions in
microfinance.

In the process of “cleaning up” the microfinance portfolio, the database of the 75 ongoing projects with
microfinance credit components was updated. Forty-four
action plans were developed for the existing projects, to
be implemented from the start of 2005; these included
midterm reviews, project restructuring, and the reprogramming of funds to support capacity building for
microfinance institutions in RMCs concerned.

n line with best practice standards, Bank work in 2004
aimed to realign the microfinance portfolio, particularly
with regard to the outreach of financial services (e.g.
oans, savings, insurance, leasing, money transfer) to
increase access to the poor while assuring the financial
self-sufficiency of the intermediaries used to provide
hese services. Steps were initiated during the year for
he recruitment of 4 microfinance specialists for the
Operations Complexes. External partnerships in microfinance were cemented through the Consultative Group
‘0 Assist the Poor (CGAP), in particular, through meetings to develop and approve activities of the funding
agency consortium, and the preparation of the Donor
Guidelines on Microfinance. \n this regard, a Bank team
ed by the President participated in the high-level meeting held in February in Paris on the theme “Donor Peer
Reviews.”

EVALUATION OF OPERATIONS

The Bank continues to conduct independent, comprehensive, and objective evaluations of its assistance strategies, policies, operations, processes, and procedures
in order to improve its support to RMCs. The Bank's
Operations Complexes play a vital role in this respect,
to ensure that evaluation findings are disseminated and
used effectively.

The number of key evaluation products undertaken in
2004 was more than double that of the previous year.
The key evaluation products during the period consisted
of 16 project/program performance evaluation reports
(PPERs); the annual review of evaluation results; 14
other reviews including country sector reviews, sector
and thematic reviews; country assistance evaluations for
3 ADF countries and 1 ADB country; reviews of operational processes and procedures; corporate evaluations;
and evaluation guidelines. The progress in thematic and
country sector studies and the reporting on development
effectiveness exceeded the work plan for the year 2004.
Substantial progress was also made in the preparatory
work for several higher-level evaluations to be conducted
in 2005.

The Independent Evaluation of ADF-VIl to IX, which
had been requested by ADF Deputies, was undertaken
during the first half of the year (see Box 3.1). Bank staff
and the consultancy team interacted with focus groups,
Management, and the Board to draw from the findings
and ongoing evaluations in the Bank. The main findings
of the evaluation can be summarized as follows:

e ADF’s compliance with ADF-VII, Vill, and IX undertakings has been fully satisfactory and the Bank has
made important contributions to RMCs’ development
efforts;

e The Bank's performance has been helped by substantial changes in corporate capacities brought about by
deep and broad institutional, policy, and administrative reforms;

e There still remains substantial unfinished business on
all fronts; and

e The main barrier to full implementation and resolution of the unfinished business is inadequacy of
human and financial resources.A feedback workshop was subsequently organized by the
Bank to discuss the findings of the study with representaives from 18 selected RMCs.

he Review of Evaluation Results (RER) for 2001-2002
was also completed in 2004. It covered 59 projects
in 28 countries for which Project Completion Reports
and Project Performance Evaluation Reports had been
repared. The main conclusion was that the tranche of

projects and programs that exited the portfolio in 2001
and 2002 demonstrated an improvement in the overall
performance ratings over those of previous years.

In 2004 there were 2 Country Evaluation Reports
presented to the Bank's Committee on Development
Effectiveness (CODE) and another 2 completed but under
review by peer reviewers. An Evaluation Guideline for
Country Assessment Reports was also prepared. Country

 

BOX 3.1

Independent Evaluation of the African Development Fund

 

The Independent Evaluation of ADF-VIl to IX, which was carried out at the request of ADF Deputies, was published in
2004. The evaluation had as its main objective to assess the
extent to which the ADF has put in place strategic objectives,
organizational structures, policies, lending instruments and
systems capable of delivering development effectiveness on a
continent-wide basis and to provide general recommendations
for the future and specific suggestions for ADF-X.

The major conclusions of the independent evaluation report
noted that the Bank Group, after undergoing intensive and
continuous reform for 8 years - often under difficult conditions
~ had achieved the following:

¢ Established a more effective organization: Within the
resource constraints, the 2 reorganizations carried out by
the Bank have created a focused and effective institution
that has equipped itself as far as possible to meet the development challenges of the 21st century.

¢ Formulated new policies and strategies: The Bank is
now equipped with a high-quality policy toolkit that is based
on current development thinking and that generally reflects
the state of the art in development.

¢ Improved process and quality control mechanisms: The
architecture required for effective and efficient quality control is now in place through the enhancement of Country
Strategy Papers (CSPs).

However, despite these achievements, the Evaluation noted
that much unfinished business remains, such as:

* Organizational and structural responses: Despite the 2
major reorganizations that have been undertaken since 1996,
the Bank Group continues to face difficulties in several areas,
including: serious understaffing; a lessening of country focus;
limited research and knowledge-generating capacity; and
limited progress in decentralizing its operations.

* Policy responses: Approximately 40 major policies and
guidelines approved since 1995 clearly reflect contemporary

 

development thinking. The essential building blocks are in
place and energies should now be concentrated on a phase
of consolidation and application.

* Programming instruments and processes: The CSPs
have become the primary strategic planning document of
the Bank Group and their preparation and their quality have
improved steadily. Despite these advances, the economic
and sector work associated with CSPs remains for the most
part inadequate and in need of upgrading.

* Project design and evaluation methodology and
review process: Despite important advances since 1998,
further attention is required to make the review process
truly interdepartmental, more rigorous and transparent.

The Report concludes that the unfinished business of the
reform effort can best be approached through incremental
steps and fine-tuning. The principal remaining barrier to
full implementation and internal take-up of past reforms is
inadequacy of human and financial resources. With additional
human and financial resources, the Bank Group can indeed
move forward to fulfill its goal of becoming the premier institution for African development.

In response to Deputies’ request and to this Report's recommendations, as well in pursuit of further improvement of the
quality of the Bank Group portfolio and its development effectiveness, Management developed an Action Plan to improve
implementation of ADF projects and programs in 2004. The
actions in the Plan have been prioritized, and several areas are
already being implemented. The Plan has a detailed implementation matrix, spelling out measures and actions to be taken
on key issues, and the target timeframe. The main thrust of
the Action Plan is, therefore, to consolidate the steady trend
of improvements in the key areas of staffing, decentralization/country focus, and disbursement in line with the Bank's
program of reforms (institutional, human, and organizational).
The actions are being implemented within the Bank, at country
level, and at the level of donor coordination and partnerships
with other stakeholders.

 

 

Corporate and Financial Managementoe] Corporate and Financial Management

Assistance Evaluations are prepared to ensure the timely
availability of evaluation findings to Country Departments
for the formulation of new CSPs. Despite the established
practice of project-level evaluations, there have in the
past only existed a few mechanisms for reporting on
aggregate Bank outcomes and Bank performance at
corporate level. A significant milestone in this direction is
the plan to prepare an Annual Review on Development
Effectiveness (ARDE), the scope and content of which
were approved by CODE in 2004. The ARDE is expected
to provide an aggregate assessment of Bank-wide, country, sector, and project-level outcomes.

As part of its effort to strengthen evaluation capacities
in RMCs, the Bank sponsored a technical strand in the
African Evaluation Association (AfrEA) Conference in
December 2004 on the theme of “Evaluation, NEPAD,
and Other Regional Initiatives” with the purpose of
promoting synergy and building a community of practice
around the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM),
which is also actively supported by the Bank.

In 2004 the Bank continued to strengthen knowledge
management and dissemination and to integrate this as
an essential part of the evaluation function. To this end
an online Help Desk is being developed and is due to
become operational by early 2005. Furthermore, preparatory work was started for the dissemination of evaluation findings, lessons, and recommendations through a
dedicated quarterly publication, also due for publication
by early 2005.

HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT

In 2003 the Bank's human resources (HR) management
was primarily concerned with the implementation of the
Bank's temporary relocation exercise and all the changes
this entailed for Bank staff and their families. In 2004, the
focus shifted to the alignment of the Bank's deliverables
as a strategic partner with corporate plans; this would be
achieved by translating business strategies into human
resource priorities. The critical challenges in this area
included:

¢ Filling about 150 professional positions;

e Building and enhancing skills through training and
staff exchange programs;

© Creating an enabling policy environment for career
mobility and advancement; and

62 DP ANNUAL REPORT 2004

ee

© Promoting and developing a framework that places
the Bank as an employer of choice through competitive compensation and benefits.

During 2004 the Bank embarked on the preparation of
a Human Resources Strategy to align human resource
management to business priorities. The strategy is to be
finalized by mid-2005.

Staff Planning and Recruitment

The recruitment campaign that the Bank had launched
in 2002 was suspended as a result of the events of
September 2002 in Céte d'Ivoire and by the subsequent
temporary relocation of the Bank to Tunis. With the
completion of the temporary relocation exercise by the
end of May 2003, the recruitment drive to fill the outstanding vacancies in the Bank (standing at some 150
vacancies in mid-2003) was relaunched and continued
throughout 2004.

One overriding objective has been to attract and hire staff
of the highest caliber, particularly in the newly prioritized
areas of operations, such as governance, water, the private sector, the environment, gender, and results-based
management. In addition, the recruitment campaign seeks
to achieve diversity in terms of geographical distribution,
gender, and age of staff. Emphasis has also been laid on
internal mobility and transparency, whereby incumbent
staff members compete with outside candidates for some
of these vacant positions. At the end of 2004, some 104
posts had been filled, accounting for 69.3 percent of the
total vacancies, with 92 new recruits having assumed duty
in 2004. More than 50 percent of these new posts were in
the Operations Complexes. All new staff received a comprehensive orientation program to foster a positive organizational culture and to effectively integrate them into
their departments. To enhance transparency and quality, a
Recruitment Manual has been produced and made available to all staff. It serves both as a guide to recruitment
and also as a basis for evaluating the recruiting process.

In support of the decentralization exercise, recruitment
was also targeted to filling vacancies in the new field
offices of Uganda and Tanzania. National Program
Officers were recruited for Cameroon, Guinea Bissau,
Mozambique, and Rwanda. In December 2004, interviews were concluded to fill new vacancies in the pilot
offices in Egypt, Ethiopia, and Gabon. A strategy has
already been put in place to recruit staff for the 8 new
field offices that are due to open in 2005.Corporate and Financial Management

Moreover, in its bid to achieve diversity in terms of
geographical distribution, the Bank undertook a series
of recruitment missions to countries in both Africa and
Europe. One noteworthy result has been a significant
reduction in the number of underrepresented countries
on the staffing of the Bank. The goal is to achieve complete representation of all member countries.

At year-end 2004 the staffing of the Bank stood at 1,043
compared to 987 at year-end 2003. Of the total staff
at year-end 2004, 649 were professional level (PL) and
Management (of whom 22.0 percent were female), while
363 were general services (GS) (55.4 percent female),
and 31 were advisers and assistant level (22.6 percent
female) (see Table 3.2). In 2004 the Bank contracted 80
short-term staff (STS) who are deployed in Abidjan-HQ
and Tunis-TRA offices. In addition, the Bank contracted 2
employment agencies in Tunis who have recruited 60 STS
for deployment at the Bank's TRA.

Annual Salary Review and Increase for General
Services (GS) Staff

The Boards of Directors approved the proposals for salary
increases for 2004 (May 2004) with effect from January
2004, and Management proposals for salary increases
for 2005 (November 2004) with effect from January
2005. The objective of the annual salary increase for the
GS staff is to recognize and reward the performance of
this category of staff and to promote greater productivity
as well as to maintain competitiveness in the local labor
market. The Board's approval was based on studies conducted by external consultants who assessed the competitiveness of the current GS staff remuneration against
the 75th percentile market reference point amongst local
market competitors.

The Boards agreed that the 2004 survey comparator
market references for the GS staff salary structure should
remain the 6 international Abidjan organizations usedin past studies and as approved by the Boards. Taking
into account the decision of the Boards of Governors to
extend the temporary relocation period, the study for the
2005 salary increase also made a spot assessment of the
local market at the TRA in Tunis. (TRA limited comparison
checks were conducted among sister institutions at the
TRA to determine validity in the local market.)

As a result of the above, the new salary guide approved
by the Boards includes, effective January 1, 2005: (i) a
salary structure adjustment of 3 percent for the GS staff;
(ii) an actual salary increase of 3 percent; and (iii) a perormance-based bonus award for GS staff whose salaries
all outside the salary guide.

Annual Salary Review for Professional Level (PL)
Staff

n November 2004 the Boards of Directors approved
Management's proposal for a salary increase to take
effect from January 2005 for PL category (Officers and
Executive level). This adjustment was in response to a
study conducted by a leading international consulting
irm that highlighted gaps between salaries at the Bank
and those at sister MDBs. The Bank seeks to ensure
hat the salary structure of its professional staff remains

internationally competitive in order to attract high-caliber
recruits. Many staff at this level possess the competencies
and skills profiles that are in great demand in competitor
markets, and which are essential to the successful implementation of the Bank's Strategic Plan.

In response to the study and the resulting Management
recommendations, the Board approved a salary structure
adjustment for PL staff of 3 percent, and an actual salary
increase of 3.5 percent, effective January 1, 2005, taking
into consideration the average salary structure adjustment implemented by sister institutions for the year.

Training and Staff Development

The Bank recognizes that learning and human capacity
building - both within the institution and in its RMCs
— are prerequisites for the achievement of the Bank's
objectives, as set out in the Strategic Plan (2003-2007).
Consequently, in a rapidly changing and challenging environment, training and staff development featured among
the Bank Group's priorities in 2004. New policies and procedures to facilitate staff learning and programs to raise
the level of staff performance and aid retention were
implemented during 2004, as presented in Box 3.2.

 

BOX 3.2

The Strategic Plan (2003-2007) sets out a range of business priorities designed to meet the challenges of economic
development and poverty reduction in Africa and to achieve
the internationally endorsed MDGs. These priorities include
sectoral and crosscutting themes and initiatives to support
development effectiveness, such as agriculture and rural
development; human resources development; private sector
development; economic integration and cooperation; governance, environment, and gender. Other priority areas identified in the Plan include: increasing the Bank's role in NEPAD;
improving water resources management; combating HIV/AIDS;
mainstreaming microfinance; strengthening Bank portfolio
supervision; decentralizing the Bank's activities for greater
client focus; developing human and knowledge management
resources and strategic staffing; and increasing the Bank's
strategic partnerships with multilateral and bilateral agencies
and key regional partners such as the ECA, NEPAD, and the
African Business Roundtable.

The Plan has enormous implications for staff training and
learning. In many of the priority areas, Bank staff need to

 

The Bank Group’s Training and Learning Priorities

acquire new knowledge and competencies and a better
understanding of RMCs’ requirements. Priority will therefore
be accorded to training in support of the following areas over
the next 2-3 years:

* Decentralization of Bank operations and management of
field offices;

* Management and leadership skills development;

* Strengthening operational skills, in particular project design
and implementation, monitoring and evaluation;

* Sensitizing staff on ways of mainstreaming key crosscutting
themes, particularly the Environmental and Social Assessment
Guidelines (ESAG) and Strategic Impacts Assessment (SIA)
Directives, environment, gender, governance, microfinance,
and poverty;

* Promotion of new development initiatives spearheaded by
the Bank, in particular the Water Initiative, NEPAD, and the
International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa (IPAA); and

¢ Supporting the Bank's aspirations to become a major
research facility for the continent and to facilitate knowledge sharing and capacity building.

A new Presidential Directive on Mobility was introduced
in 2004. The Mobility Program offers staff the chance to
develop new skills and facilitate their movement within
the organization, thereby enhancing their career prospects and job satisfaction. Over 20 staff took advantage
of this opportunity in 2004, some transferring to field
offices and others to positions in other Complexes.

Internal Capacity-building Activities

Over 25 courses were conducted internally during the
course of the year, to train more than 400 staff in
various disciplines, including: Procurement of Goods and
Services; Investment Appraisal; Anti-Money Laundering;
HIV/AIDS; Mainstreaming Gender in Agricultural Projects;
Budget Preparation and Monitoring; Renewable Energy;
Environmental Policies and Guidelines; Motivation;
Country Governance Profiles; Advanced Derivatives and
Interest Rates Swaps; Project Quality in the Education
Sector; Economics of Poverty; Costab and SUMMIT.

In addition, intensive training was conducted for members of the Recruitment and Promotion Board and Panels,
heads of organizational units, and recruitment officers.
This aimed to ensure that those managers and staff who
are involved in recruitment and selection are equipped
with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to conduct
interviews effectively. Senior Management, including the
Vice-Presidents of CMVP, OCVP, PRVP, and FNVP. participated in the training.

Forty staff were sent abroad for specialized training
during the year, while a further 8 were seconded to the
World Bank and IMF for 3-month periods. Seventy-nine
staff registered for second language training, including
Arabic.

Staff Retirement Plan Reforms

At its meeting held in November 2004, the Board of
Directors approved Management's proposal for reforms
in the Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), which will become
effective on January 1, 2005. The first and most significant improvement involves the clarification of the obligation of the Bank towards the Plan. The SRP operates as
a defined benefit scheme. However, the Rules did not
explicitly recognize the Plan as a defined benefit plan.
The approved SRP reforms have clarified and defined
the legal nature of the pension plan. The sponsoring
employer (ADB) will adopt the standard actuarial practice of annual variable cost for contributions in defined
benefit schemes.

66 DP ANNUAL REPORT 2004

ee

The second most important set of proposals aims at
improving the transparency of the Plan and addressing
the embedded weaknesses in the Rules of the Plan. The
key reform improvements include:

e Elimination of the tax factor in future pension benefits computations; a revision of the employee contribution rate from 7 percent of the pensionable salary
to 9 percent of the base salary; and an increase in
the pension accumulation rate from 2 percent of the
pensionable salary to 2.5 percent of the base salary,
per year of participation;

e Denomination of pension benefits in the same cur
rency as the salary of the participant;

e Indexation of all annuities: using the UA and the local
currency inflation rates, with a maximum adjustment
of 4 percent per annum;

e Removal of the marital discrimination in payment of
the death benefit.

The final set of proposals involves harmonizing the
Rules of the SRP with those of the Human Resources
Department of the Bank and allowing more flexibility in
the administration of the pension benefits. Key reforms
include:

¢ Lowering the early retirement reduction factors to 5
percent per year of anticipation (instead of 6 percent)
between 55 and 60 years;

© Increasing child benefits from UA 600 to UA 1,500
per child. The amount, per year and per family,
increases from UA 1,800 to UA 4,500. The child benefits would be indexed and adjusted with COLA, in
the same way as for pensions.

These reforms can be expected to improve the pension
plan, enhance transparency, eliminate discrimination, and
give flexibility to participants regarding their choice of
benefits. Above all, by ensuring that the Bank's staff will
enjoy a commensurate and secure retirement income, the
approved Plan bolsters the Bank's competitiveness as an
employer of choice among MDBs. These improvements
also pave the way for establishing pension transfer agreements between the Bank and its sister organizations.FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

The financial management function has as its principal
objective an efficient utilization of the Bank Group's
financial resources and risk-bearing capacity. In pursuit
of this objective, the Department's activities target 2
areas: first, the formulation of financial and risk management policies, guidelines, and procedures and, secondly,
the monitoring and reporting on compliance thereof.
Organizationally, the Department's operations are divided
into 3 thematic groups: (i) asset and liability management, (ii) credit risk management, and (iii) treasury risk
management.

In 2004 the Bank's asset and liability management
(ALM) activities continued to focus on implementing
the Bank Group’s financial reform program, which had
been launched in 1996. To this end, the Bank concentrated on further strengthening the Asset and Liability
Management Committee (ALCO) control process by
streamlining the Committee's routine decision-making functions such as maintaining alignment with the
interest rate, currency, and liquidity risk benchmarks to
devote more time to its policy development and financial strategic planning role.

During the year, the ALM guidelines for the ADB and the
NTF were revised and a proposal to introduce an advance
commitment authority scheme for the ADF in support
of the ADF-X replenishment was prepared. The advance
commitment authority scheme, endorsed by the ADF
Deputies during the ADF-X Replenishment negotiations,
make it possible to approve more loans and grants for
development, thereby eventually resulting in increased
use of the liquidity of ADF for projects and programs in
eligible member countries.

Credit Risk Management

During 2004 the Bank's credit risk management activities continued to adjust to the growing emphasis on
non-sovereign guaranteed projects in the Bank's lending
program. Credit opinions were submitted to the Board
for all new projects whose risks were principally of a
commercial nature. The credit management team also
contributed to the development of a new Post-Conflict
Countries Framework (PCCF) to assist those countries
emerging from conflict to clear their arrears to the Bank
Group and to qualify for debt relief under the Enhanced
HIPC Initiative. In 2004 the first 2 country cases under the

  

Corporate and Financial Management

new PCC framework (for Burundi and the Congo) were
approved by the Board.

Treasury Risk Management

The Bank's treasury risk management functions during
2004 focused on completing the implementation of
the IT systems to handle straight-through processing of
all treasury transactions. During the year a major quality assurance exercise was completed to validate and
convert the Bank's borrowing and derivatives database.
Models were implemented to produce the necessary
valuations to comply with international accounting
standards.

INTERNAL AUDIT

The Internal Auditing Department (AUDT) seeks to provide
independent, objective assurance and consulting services
to improve the Bank's operations through a systematic
approach to evaluate and enhance the effectiveness of
risk management, control, and governance processes. In
order for the Bank to effectively discharge its mandate as
well as comply with the International Standards for the
Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, AUDT adopts a
proactive and participatory approach in the provision of
consultancy and advisory services and in carrying out traditional auditing, while maintaining its professionalism,
independence, and integrity.

The annual work program of the Internal Audit Department was derived from a risk-based, long-term coverage
lan, which analyzed the Bank Group Complexes by
auditable activities and ranked these into high, medium
and low risk. The work program was devised so as to
rovide reasonable assurance to Management within the
constraints of the available resources.

Planned project audits are becoming an increasing
art of the Bank's auditing functions. Such audits
underscore the importance of good governance and
accountability within the Bank and RMCs. The country
ocus of such exercises aim at providing an overall indication as to the adequacy of the systems of
controls relating to Bank-financed projects instituted
y the Bank, the Borrower, Executing Agencies, and
Project Implementation Units. During 2004, there was
a marked improvement in the submission of annual
audit reports from field projects.

 

ANNUAL REPORT 2004_ Corporate and Financial Management

During 2004 the control environment within the Finance,
Planning and Corporate Complexes was enhanced by
the full implementation of SAP/R3 system. While the
overriding objective of the Bank’s AUDT to concentrate
on high- and medium-risk activities remains unchanged,
the scope of the audit work was influenced by the need
to ensure efficient controls over staff-related benefits.
Approximately 34 percent of the Bank's AUDT effort was
devoted to this area.

Special audits and investigations were another priority area during 2004 to meet the requirements of good
governance in country operations and at corporate
levels. Increasingly, AUDT services are also being sought
for problematic project-procurement matters. Managers
have become more open in recognizing mismanaged
projects while Senior Management has adopted a tougher attitude toward lapses in controls and procedures.
AUDT has been able to identify some lapses in controls,
leading, in some instances, to the suspension of disbursements and a strengthening of the control environment
within the Bank and the RMCs.

Furthermore AUDT, in partnership with PDRE as well
as the Operations Complexes, participated in training
workshops for RMCs. As a resources department, AUDT
provided training in loan accounting systems with an
emphasis on reporting and auditing. This intervention has
assisted in providing the Bank-funded projects with practical guidelines in how to set up project records and in
how to strengthen the accountability of project funds.

During 2004 work progressed on the proposed reorganization of the Internal Audit Department. Following
the Board approval of the Guidelines for Preventing
and Combating Corruption and Fraud in Bank Group
Operations, Management presented to the Boards a
proposal for the establishment of a dedicated anti-corruption and fraud Investigation Mechanism. The proposal
includes the establishment of an Oversight Committee
on Fraud and Corruption (OCCF) which will ensure fair
but effective treatment of any potential fraud cases.
It also includes the creation of an independent, anticorruption and fraud investigation division under the
Office of the Auditor-General, and the renaming of the
existing Internal Audit Department as the Office of the
Auditor-General, with two separate divisions (the Anti
ee

Corruption and Fraud Investigation Division and Internal
Audit Division).

GENERAL COUNSEL AND LEGAL SERVICES

The General Counsel and Legal Services function (GECL)
has at its mandate the safeguarding of the Bank's legal
and statutory provisions and the protection of its legal
interests while providing legal advice to the President and
the Boards as and when needed. Increasingly, it is also
engaged in promoting law for development while enhancing good governance and judicial capacity in RMCs.

In June 2004 an independent compliance review and
problem-solving mechanism, otherwise referred to as the
Bank Group Independent Review Mechanism (IRM), was
established. The mechanism will provide stakeholders
adversely affected by Bank Group-financed projects with
a forum to express any complaints and to seek redress
in the event of the Bank's non-compliance with its own
applicable policies and procedures.

During the year under review, in support of the Bank's
decentralization program, GECL concluded negotiations
with many of the host states. It also developed, with
he Strategic Planning Complex, the hosting arrangement and related documentation for the African Water
Facility Special Fund, which was established by the Board
of Governors in May 2004, and became effective in
December 2004'. GECL also contributed to procuring

The African Water Facility Special Fund is a product of the collaboration between the Bank and the African Ministerial Council on Water (AMCOW), and is dedicated to mobilizing
resources from donors to finance water infrastructure and water investment facilitation activities in RMCS.

68 DP ANNUAL REPORT 2004Another milestone for the Bank Group in 2004 was the
adoption of an integrated Internal Control Framework,
which places the Bank in tandem with international best
practice in internal fiduciary controls and financial reporting. The Bank also continues to make progress with its
governance-related initiatives, including the design and
implementation of country governance profiles, antimoney laundering measures, and preparation of a draft
Bank corporate governance strategy.

A further highlight for the year under review was the
publication in September 2004 of the first issue of
the African Development Bank Law for Development
Bulletin. A major capacity-building initiative also took
place during the year in the form of the cosponsoring by
the Bank of the Second African School for International
Financial Law.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
MANAGEMENT AND
TELECOMMUNICATIONS

During 2004 the Bank's information technology strategy consolidated the upgrading and maintenance of
its IT and telecommunications infrastructure under
the Information Technology and Telecommunications
Modernization Program (ITTMP). By capitalizing on the
substantial investments made in the IT infrastructure in
the recent past, the Bank seeks to ensure that staff will
continue to have access to appropriate software and
equipment and will be fully trained in their use, so that
the benefits of business process reengineering are fully
realized. Furthermore, the IT strategy during the year
continued to address new priorities emanating from the
Strategic Plan (2003-2007).

The SUMMIT application, a fully integrated treasury
system introduced in 2002, was upgraded during 2004
to take advantage of some enhanced features and
SUMMIT/NUMERIX integration. The enhanced new features include straight-through processing, collateral management, and callable bonds amongst others.

Two key new departmental applications came online
during the year. The first was in the Audit Department
and the second in the Bank's Language Services Unit.
The audit application improves the Bank's risk management in scheduled audit programs and serves as a valuable planning and automation tool for key audit activi
ties. The language services application enhances the
localization function of the unit. It provides the users
with a database of pre-translated words and phrases.
Efficiency gains in translation services are expected to
rise from the current level of around 25 percent to
upwards of 70 percent as the number of entries on the
database increases over time.

Following the activation of the Bank's business continuity plan and the temporary relocation exercise in 2003,
a new IT infrastructure with significant changes was
installed at the TRA site and is fully operational. During
the course of 2004 the Bank upgraded the core applications (SAP. DARMS, and SUMMIT) that impact on the
business continuity procedures. Furthermore, in order to
ensure that all the changes implemented at the TRA are
aligned with the IT architecture at the Bank’s business
continuity site in Paris, 2 test missions were carried out.
The success of these missions offers the reassurance that
in the event of any future emergency, all the applications installed and running on the TRA systems in Tunis
could be properly restored and operated at the business
continuity site.

Virtual Private Network (VPN) Linkage and
Satellite Enhancements

The IT networks for the Bank's headquarters in Abidjan,
the TRA, and the operational field offices need to
be linked securely. Consequently, a project has been
launched to construct the linkage through a VPN (Virtual
Private Network) infrastructure. Such a facility will permit all Bank staff and authorized personnel to access
information and applications from any location. Partial
delivery of the equipment was made during 2004 and
installation is due for completion in the first quarter of
2005. The network will be extended to the remaining
field offices as they are opened in 2005 and 2006.

Progress continued during 2004 on upgrading satellite communications systems to provide online access
to HQ systems and video-conferencing capabilities in
the network of field offices. VSAT systems are already
operational in 3 field offices (Egypt, Gabon, Nigeria) and
at the TRA. During the year under review, the satellite
system was installed in 3 more Country Offices (Ethiopia,
Tanzania, and Uganda). For the remaining field offices,
negotiations were held with regulators and the respective
governments to commit to the granting of telecommunications licenses and permits.

Integrated Knowledge Management System
Progress continued during 2004 on building an integrated knowledge management system for the Bank.
he IT strategy actively supported this effort through its
implementation of DARMS (Data Automation Resource
Management System), the Corporate Data Warehouse
Project, the Executive Information System, and the Web
Enhancement System. All Board documents from 1994
‘o date are now available, while pre-1994 documents
(a total of 21,000) are being scanned and imported into
he system. It is estimated that during the first quarter of
2005, all documents will have been scanned.

he Corporate Data Warehouse (DW) Project provides a
consolidated repository of historical internal and external
data related to the Bank's development operations. The
roject implementation started in May 2004 and will produce a single blueprint that will be used to quickly implement the Executive Information System and then proceed
with the Corporate Data Warehouse. The Executive
nformation System is planned for March 2005.

 

0 enhance the Bank's website, the I*NET contract was
signed in December 2004, with the duration of the project scheduled for 19 months. The first phase of the project will consist of requirements definition and scoping
and is expected to be completed during the first quarter
of 2005. The second phase will address improvements
to both the Internet and Intranet web platforms as well
as the implementation of an Extranet. Meanwhile, the
Bank launched in December 2004 a quick-fix solution
that provides the dynamic website, separation of content
management from the web technical administration, and
a better search engine.

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES

With regard to the administration of the Bank's statutory
Headquarters in Abidjan, efforts have been ongoing to
minimize operating and maintenance costs while continuing to safeguard the security of the staff and the
integrity of the Bank's assets.

At the Bank’s Temporary Relocation Agency (TRA) in
Tunis, a process of consolidation took place throughout
the year 2004. In this respect, efforts were ongoing to
fully furbish the offices and office equipment to the highest standards and to provide a favorable working environment for Bank staff. In the course of the second semester,

70 DP ANNUAL REPORT 2004

ee

the administrative services implemented the decision
approved earlier by the Boards, concerning the renting
of additional office space. As a result, new offices have
been rented, fitted out, and made fully operational to
accommodate the increase in personnel and to upgrade
working conditions.

A particular focus at the TRA in respect of staff facilities
has been major improvements, in terms of facilities, to
the staff Medical Center and the Library. Progress is also
being made in the development of a Public Information
Center. Measures have also been taken to scale up
security across the various sites of the Bank. An access
control system has been installed and video-surveillance
equipment is operational in most of the sites.

In respect of staff travel arrangements, ongoing negotiations with airline companies have resulted in more competitive fares, thus effecting substantial savings for the
Bank. Similar cost-saving agreements have been reached
with a satellite operator in respect of communications
costs and with insurance companies to provide bettervalue cover for both property and personnel.

The ongoing implementation of the Bank’s decentralization policy led to the opening in 2004 of two Country
Offices in Uganda and Tanzania and a Regional Office
in Senegal. In coordination with PECOF (Permanent
Committee for Country Offices), Administrative Services
helped to negotiate Host Country Agreements with the
respective governments, identify premises and local capabilities in terms of goods and services procurement, and
assist in operationalizing the field offices.

PROCUREMENT MONITORING SERVICES

The procurement monitoring function of the Bank continued to be executed through the provision of assistance to
the Operations Complexes in the review of procurement
documents throughout the project cycle. Activities included reviewing tender documents and borrowers’ evaluation
reports and participating in about 20 project-cycle missions
covering several projects. About 180 Complex procurement issues were treated during the year, which represents
an increase of 12.5 percent over 2003.

Twelve monthly briefs outlining sensitive procurement situations were prepared for the attention of Management,
while procurement post-review missions were conductedfor 5 ongoing projects that had been identified in the
Annual Portfolio Performance Review (APPR) as projects
at high risk and with procurement problems, for which
disbursement stood at around 50 percent.

Procurement capacity-building support was provided to
the Bank's RMCs through the implementation, jointly
with Research Department (PDRE), of 12 national Project
Implementation Workshops, which were essentially procurement-based in content. Five procurement-training
seminars were also conducted for staff, one of which was
targeted at managers and section heads. In pursuit of
continued dialogue, communication, and interaction with
clients and partners, 8 Business Opportunities Seminars
were conducted externally in various member countries
(Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Portugal, and
Switzerland) while 11 others were undertaken internally
in Tunis for visiting delegations. Also, the first phase of
the migration of the Bank's Consultancy Registration
System (DACON) to the SAP platform was completed,
and website registration by consultants became operational in November 2004.

Harmonization, enhancement, and improvement of procurement policies, procedures, and relations with sister
institutions continued during 2004. Activities included
2 meetings of the heads of Procurement, a meeting
between the MDBs and the International Contractors
Associations, 3 meetings of the Working Group on
the preparation of Master Procurement Document for
Turnkey Contracts, as well as 5 international meetings
dealing with procurement harmonization. The Bank continued to cooperate closely with the World Bank in the
preparation of Country Procurement Assessment Reports
(CPARs) for 3 RMCs. Finally, the Bank was also represented at 5 other international forums; these focused on
fighting fraud and corruption in procurement, e-procurement, and government procurement.

 

CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS

The Bank initiated the development of a corporate
Communications Strategy in 2004. This initiative, which
seeks to enhance the Bank's standing as an information
and research center on African development issues, and
as a multilateral finance and development institution of
choice for the international donor community, are scheduled to continue through 2005.

  

Corporate and Financial Management

External Communications

The 2004 external communications program targeted
3 major events organized by the Bank: the Annual
Meetings held in Kampala, Uganda, in May; the Group's
First Water Week in Tunis in July, and celebrations of the
Fortieth Anniversary of the Bank in September 2004.

A major undertaking during the year involved preparations for the redesign of the Bank's website. This will
improve the home page, introduce a more user-friendly
categorization of development themes, and a powerful
search engine to facilitate site navigation. Content management measures included the designation of departmental Web Coordinators, who were given appropriate
training for enriching site content.

The web is a recognized platform for implementation of
the Bank's revised Policy on the Disclosure of Information.
This policy, approved by the Boards in March 2004,
aims to broaden stakeholder participation and to share
information on Bank activities with those parties that are
most affected. A policy implementation guide is under
preparation and efforts have been made to sensitize staff
on the underlying rationale of the policy.

A further vehicle to enhance the Bank's visibility is the proposed Public Information Center (PIC), which will serve as
an important knowledge-sharing venue. Arrangements
to open a PIC in Tunis are well advanced. An interdepartmental committee has been established to review the
state of Bank publications and to recommend measures
to streamline intellectual production in the institution
and the management of publications stock. The use of
broadcasting and visuals as channels to help publicize the
Bank's activities also received renewed emphasis.

Internal Communications

New measures to improve internal communications are
being implemented using both electronic and print platforms. A completely revamped version of the newsletter,
ADB Dialogue, was launched, featuring a wide range of
institutional and social topics. Modules have also been
developed for staff media training both at the TRA and
in the Country/Regional Offices to enhance project communication. A media guide for field communications has
also been produced. Furthermore, the number of staff on
the communications team has been increased in order to
fully implement the Bank's communications program.

This chapter examines how the Bank in 2004, in conformity with its Vision Statement of 1999 and Strategic Plan
2003-2007, continued to translate its policies, guidelines,
and operational priorities into projects and programs
to foster poverty reduction and sustainable economic
growth in its regional member countries (RMCs).

THE BANK GROUP’S STRATEGIC
APPROACH

During 2004 the Bank continued to focus its interventions on the following priority areas:

e At the country level: agriculture and rural development, infrastructure (including transportation, power
supply, communications, water supply and sanitation), education, health, private sector development,
and good governance;

e At the regional level: economic cooperation and
integration, in particular through its continued support to the New Partnership for Africa's Development
(NEPAD) and the African Peer Review Mechanism
(APRM), as well as the water initiatives;

© Crosscutting activities: promoting sustainable environmental management and gender equity.

The Bank also increased its support for structural reforms
and debt relief operations in line with the Enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.

A number of important policy documents were prepared in 2004, including the Bank Framework for
the ADF-X Replenishment, the revised Action Plan to
Improve the Implementation of ADF Operations and
the Strategic Resource Framework for Institutional
Development (SRFID). The Action Plan presents the overall framework for scaling up Bank Group activities and
sets out clear monitorable indicators to assess progress
in staffing, decentralization, knowledge management,
and disbursements (see Box 2.2). The SRFID comprehensively sets out a global budget and timeframe for
building the Bank's capacity to deliver on its mandate,
including the many pressing demands made by its RMCs
and donors, and its commitments to the broader development agenda.

Operational Priorities and Effectiveness

DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS OF BANK
GROUP OPERATIONS

During 2004 the Bank Group scaled up efforts to improve
the development effectiveness of its operations by
strengthening the review process, and initiating qualityat-entry (QEA) and quality-of-supervision (QSA) assessments. Other measures included improving linkages
between lending and performance, and the alignment of
Bank strategies to country priorities, as defined in RMCs'
Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs). Furthermore,
the Bank has improved operational selectivity, increased
the use of participatory approaches at all projectcycle stages, enhanced supervision, and strengthened its
partnership and coordination with other development
partners at both the corporate and country levels. These
measures form part of an overall drive by the Bank to
optimize its assistance to lower-income RMCs.

In order to remedy the weaknesses of the reporting
process on Bank outcomes and performance at the corporate level, the Bank's Committee on Operations and
Development Effectiveness (CODE) approved in 2004
he scope and content of an Annual Review on (ARDE)
Development Effectiveness with a view to providing an
aggregate assessment of corporate, country, sector, and
roject operational performance. One of the objectives of
his policy framework is to achieve cross-country selectivity based on the enhanced performance-based allocaion (PBA) system of ADF resources, as well as ensuring
selectivity within countries by aligning Country Strategy
Papers (CSPs) with PRSPs. The evaluation of investment
rojects and programs, including policy reforms and
other lending and non-lending instruments at the counry and sector levels, will form the basis of the first assessment of development effectiveness, with its conclusions
expected during the first quarter of 2005.

 

Harmonizing operations with development partners is
another important element in the development effectiveness agenda. In this regard, the Bank collaborates
with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the UK's
Department for International Development (DFID), GTZ,
and the Strategic Partnership for Africa (SPA), among
others, in order to minimize transaction costs to RMCs,
leverage areas of special expertise, and optimize synergistic benefits. The collaboration includes capacity and institution building, cofinancing of programs and projects,

Grassroots participation and dialogue promote country ownership of projects and
thereby enhance development effectiveness.

especially those related to PRSPs and Poverty Reduction
Support Credits (PRSCs), and harmonization of intervenion mechanisms including administrative procedures. In
addition, joint support for the implementation of PRSPs
eatured prominently during the SPA meeting that the
Bank hosted in Tunis in January 2004.

Strengthening dialogue with RMCs through the Bank's
ongoing decentralization program will serve to boost the
Bank's visibility, heighten country ownership of projects
and programs, and improve the monitoring of operaions in the field, thereby contributing to development
effectiveness. The decentralization will accelerate under
he SRFID, as noted by the Boards in December 2004. In
addition to the existing 9 Regional and Country Offices
(Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal,
anzania, Tunis, and Uganda) a further 8 offices will open
in 2005, followed by another 8 in 2006.

Greater Selectivity in Operations

he first Annual Review of the Strategic Plan, published
in 2004, reaffirmed the emphasis on selectivity in Bank
operations. The Bank’s areas of activity have been
streamlined to no more than 3 sectors at country level
‘or those RMCs eligible for ADF resources. In both lowand middle-income countries (MICs), selectivity is to be
achieved through the alignment of the CSPs with the
PRSPs and National Development Plans.

he key criteria guiding the cross-country resource
allocations are income poverty, post-conflict status, and
erformance. Resources are targeted at those countries
where the overall policy environment favors aid effeciveness and where the Bank's presence will yield high

 

73 ™~ ANNUAL REPORT 2004

ee

development impact. At the end of 2004, for example,
hrough the PBA system, high-performing RMCs received
a 28.8 percent allocation of resources against 4.8 percent for non-performing RMCs (see also Box 2.1). Some
development issues such as NEPAD, regional integration,
he water initiatives, and HIV/AIDS are most effectively
addressed at the regional level, but with clear linkages
0 the Bank's strategic objectives and country operational
work.

Results-based Management

he Bank took an active part in organizing the Second
nternational Roundtable on Managing for Development
Results, which was held in Marrakech, Morocco, during
February 4-6, 2004. The Roundtable was co-hosted by
he ADB and the World Bank and attracted more than
50 participants, representing 30 developing countries, 30
donor agencies, the 5 Heads of MDBs, and the Head of
OECD-DAC. The meeting culminated in the signing of the
joint Memorandum of Understanding and Core Principles
on Managing for Development Results. During the year
under review, the Bank took an active role in the OECDDAC-MDB Joint Venture on Managing for Results and is
co-organizing a study on the methods and approaches
‘aken to harmonizing country PRSP reporting systems.

 

n line with the ADF-IX Lending Policy, the Bank Group
designed a Results Measurement Framework (RMF) to
rack the impact of the ADF-financed operations as well
as donor assistance, and implementation of this instrument began in 2004. A further Bank instrument to scale
up its effectiveness is the Balanced Scorecard (BSC),
which was designed to develop, execute, and manage
the Strategic Plan. The BSC is due to be implemented
by mid-2005. During 2004, Management developed
an Action Plan to Improve the Implementation of ADF
Operations, which incorporates key recommendations
of the Independent Evaluation of ADF-VII to IX (see Box
2.2). It promotes a results-based management approach,
including a results-based CSP format and an improved
project design; enhanced Economic Sector Work (ESW);
more efficient procurement and accelerated disbursement; training of officials from RMCs; monitoring and
evaluation (M&E), as well as research and knowledge
building. The Action Plan will be monitored on a regular
basis and progress in implementing its activities will be
reported to the Fund's Board of Directors on a quarterly
and annual basis. These measures are designed to transform the Bank Group into a fully fledged results-based
management (RBM) institution.he Bank prepared in 2004 an Annotated Outline for a
Results-based Country Strategy Paper (RBCSP), which will
be reviewed in early 2005. Based on best practices accumulated by sister institutions, it provides a basis for the
Bank to align its program with RMCs’ PRSPs. The RBCSP
includes a monitorable results-based matrix to be evaluated at the end of its cycle. Also during the year under
review, the Bank developed an enhanced Results-based
Logframe, which requires clearer specification of impactlevel goals, as well as ascertaining risk mitigation and the
identification of beneficiaries within the matrix.

With respect to monitoring and evaluation (M&E), challenges are emerging as the Bank moves toward a
results-based management approach at corporate and
country levels. As the recent review on monitoring and
evaluation shows, there is a need to rectify the gaps in
he tracking systems of performance measurements for
he Bank's lending and non-lending operations at project,
country, and corporate levels. In this regard, the Bank will
undertake a detailed review of the current supervision
system in 2005 and will suggest specific areas for priority
action.

 

During the course of 2004, guidelines and procedures
on quality-at-entry and quality-of-supervision assessments were developed, in addition to the completion of
the 2002-2003 Annual Portfolio Performance Review. |n
order to identify projects that might require additional
monitoring, the Bank revised its projects-at-risk methodology. While the review showed that there was no
significant deterioration in the portfolio, the application
of the new methodology resulted in raising the overall
level of projects-at-risk.

The SRFID will provide the resources needed over the next
3 years (2005-2007) to transform the Bank into a resultsbased management institution. In addition to UA 2.93
million targeted for quality assurance initiatives during
that period, UA 1.02 million has also been earmarked for
the implementation of RBM activities (IT and training).

Donor Harmonization and Alignment

In accordance with the recommendations of the Rome
High-Level Forum on Donor Harmonization, the Bank
prepared in September 2004 the Bank Group Action
Plan on Harmonization, Alignment, and Managing for
Results. This Action Plan analyzes operational activities
aimed at mainstreaming the international harmonization
agenda within the Bank Group and in RMCs, as well as

 

the development of appropriate indicators for monitoring
and assessing the implementation of the Rome Agenda.

In November 2004 the Bank organized in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, a Regional Workshop on Harmonization,
Alignment and Management for Development Results,
in collaboration with the World Bank. At the workshop,
donors reaffirmed their Monterrey and Rome pledges to
increase development assistance on a more predictable
basis to enable countries to meet the MDGs. Other key
conclusions included the importance of donors aligning
development assistance to results-based strategies of
the beneficiary countries as a basis for harmonization.
Furthermore, a consensus was reached on the necessity for developing partner countries to exercise effective
ownership of the development process, including southsouth and regional cooperation in finding solutions to
common development challenges.

At the country level, activities in this area include the
alignment of CSPs with the RMCs’ priorities, as spelt out
in their PRSPs; the harmonization of country programming with other partners; provision of technical/financial assistance to RMCs to finalize their Action Plans
and PRSPs (examples are Uganda, Mozambique, and
Ethiopia); and collaboration on sector and thematic issues
such as HIV/AIDS, NEPAD, water and sanitation, agriculture, infrastructure, and regional integration.

The Bank is also involved in the development of implementation indicators and in the monitoring and reporting
of the progress made at country level, in collaboration
with partner development agencies. As an example, the
Bank has made significant contributions to the World
Bank's Global Monitoring Report 2004, which presents
policies, actions, and initiatives implemented by developing and well as developed countries toward the achievement of the MDGs.

BANK GROUP FOCUS ON POVERTY
REDUCTION

In February 2004 a new Policy on Poverty Reduction was
approved by the Boards. The new policy is informed by a
broadened definition of poverty, best practices in poverty
reduction, concerted approaches toward more effective
support for PRSPs and the MDGs, and the focusing of all

the links between CSPs and poverty diagnostics, sectoral
priorities, and outcome indicators of country-owned
PRSPs.

In line with the new Poverty Reduction Policy, the
new CSPs prepared in 2004 for Botswana, Djibouti,
Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, and Sdo Tomé & Principe
emphasized the importance of clearly and systematically
addressing poverty issues. Thus, key aspects such as propoor growth, public expenditure strategies, strengthening quality-at-entry of projects, and safety net programs
are addressed in the new CSPs. Increased attention is
now being paid to reflect the poverty reduction measures
and sectoral priorities outlined in country-owned PRSPs
with a view to aligning the Bank's interventions with the
aspirations and outcome indicators articulated by the
RMCs themselves.

Poverty Reduction Support

The Bank has been supportive of the PRSP processes
in the RMCs since their inception. In this area, several
countries have benefited from financial support from the
Bank. This is particularly the case with the policy-based
loans designed to facilitate the implementation of PRSPs
in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Tanzania during
the year. The ADF provided Poverty Reduction Support
Loans to the 4 RMCs amounting to UA 147.4 million
during 2004.

In 2004 the Bank approved a loan to Tanzania (UA
50.0 million) to assist in the financing of the Poverty
Reduction Support Program. It also extended to Rwanda
UA 21.9 million to assist in the financing of Phase |
of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Support Program
(2004-2006) and UA 15.5 million to Burkina Faso to
finance part of the cost of the Supplementary Poverty
Reduction Strategy Support Program Il (PCASRP Il - see
Box 4.1). A Poverty Reduction Support Loan amounting to UA 60.0 million was granted to Ethiopia to
help finance the Sustainable Development and Poverty
Reduction Program (SDPRP). The Bank's support for
the Ethiopian project is part of an overall multi-partner
development budget support financing equivalent to
UA 261.8 million.

During 2004 Management continued preparations for a
Progress Report on Poverty Reduction, to cover lending
and non-lending activities during 2001-2002. The report
will be finalized in 2005. In addition, arrangements are
underway to launch the preparation of the Annual
Poverty Reports for 2003 and 2004. These reports will
examine the extent to which the Bank's Policy on Poverty
Reduction is being used to inform Bank operations and
to identify opportunities and constraints during its implementation.

 

BOX 4.1

Bank Support for Burkina Faso’s Supplementary Poverty Reduction Strategy Support Program II

 

This program is comprised of 3 components: (i) accelerated
growth by consolidating the macroeconomic framework and
strengthening competitiveness; (ii) improved access to basic
social services; and (iii) promotion of good governance. The
overall goal of the program is to reduce the incidence of poverty in the country from the 2003 level of 46.6 percent to 41
percent by 2006, targeting in particular the most vulnerable
social groups. The key objectives include the following:

* To attain a 5.2 percent annual growth rate in 2004 compared to an annual average rate of 4.2 percent between
2000 and 2003, while containing the inflation rate at
below 3 percent in 2004, and reducing the current account
deficit from 12.2 percent of GDP in 2003 to 11.8 percent in
2004;

 

© To increase the investment rate from 18.9 percent of GDP in
2003 to 20.5 percent in 2004 and 22 percent in 2006;

* To raise the school enrollment rate from 50/43 percent

(male/female) in 2004 to 70/65 percent (male/female) in

2010;

To improve the male literacy rate from 28 percent in 2004

to 40 percent in 2010;

Boost the DTC3 vaccination rate from 65 percent in 2004

to 87.5 percent in 2006, and thereby improve the Infant

Mortality Rate to 313 per 100,000 births; and

To augment budgetary allocations in the social sectors under

the 2005 Budget Act to 13 percent for education and 13.2

percent for health (including HIV/AIDS), in line with the

Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and reflecting the

PRSP.

 

 

80 2, ANNUAL REPORT 2004AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT

Given that poverty is most acute in rural areas, the Bank
gives special emphasis to agriculture and rural development activities in its portfolio of projects and programs.
In line with its Agriculture and Rural Development Sector
Policy (2000), the Bank assists African countries to develop
comprehensive and realistic plans for rural development
and agricultural modernization. The plans focus on policy,
institutional, and technological changes, food security,
community-based organization programs, and land tenure
security, to effect a transformation in Africa’s rural areas.

During 2004 the Bank Group approved loans and grants
for 26 projects in the agriculture and rural development sector in RMCs, amounting to UA 274.5 million,
representing 15.8 percent of total Bank Group lending
for the year. For the concessional and non-concessional
windows, Bank Group assistance to agriculture and rural
development amounted to UA 251.6 million and UA
22.9 million respectively. As at December 31, 2004, the
cumulative loans and grants approved since 1967 for the
agriculture and rural development sector for the various
operations amounted to UA 6.41 billion, or 18.3 percent
of total Bank Group cumulative lending.

The Bank Group approved in December 2004 a continent-wide
project to counter the menace of tsetse flies in order to eradicate “sleeping sickness.” The Creation of Sustainable Tsetse
and Trypanosomiasis (T&T) Free Areas in East and West Africa
Project forms the first phase of a wider program on the continental level, coordinated by the African Union Pan-African T&T
Eradication Campaign (PATTEC).

The duration of the program is scheduled for 6 years and the
objective is to eradicate T&T from the 37 affected African
countries and so remove the constraint on livestock production and human productivity. It has 4 interrelated components,
namely: (i) suppression and eradication of the tsetse flies, (ii)
human resource developmenticapacity building, (iii) sustainable land management, and (iv) program coordination and
management. The program will be implemented in a sustained
and continuous way through a series of interlinked and coor

dinated projects. The Bank and PATTEC are leading the efforts
to mobilize resources for use in the implementation of the
program. The ADF will provide a loan of UA 44.6 million with
another UA 2.9 million in the form of a grant. The loan and
grant will cover 86.4 percent of the total cost with participating countries and development partners funding the rest.

The project will free 13 million hectares from T&T. It will train
600 technical staff, 1,800 extension staff, 3,600 village technicians, and 1,200 village leaders. It will also enable an estimated
increase in production of crops and livestock by 19,000 mt of
meat, 99,000 liters of milk, 7,000 mt of sorghum, and 15,336
mt of various crops in the project areas. Momentum for action
is building in a number of affected countries to remove the disease. Removal of the constraint of T&T is needed for the success of other programs and particularly for NEPAD initiatives.

capacities in sustainable management of fish resources
and to ensure a secure level of fish stocks. The overall
goal of these agricultural projects is to increase agricultural productivity while mainstreaming environmental
sustainability concerns; improve the living standards and
incomes of rural communities; enhance household food
security; and improve rural infrastructure, such as feeder
roads and irrigation schemes.

Other approved projects and programs for this sector in
2004 included the Farm Income Enhancement and Forest
Conservation Project in Uganda, the Third Line of Credit
and the Tandjieskoppe Green Scheme Project in Namibia,
and the District Agricultural Sector Investment Project in
Tanzania. These all focused on natural resources conservation and management, agribusiness development, and
rural income enhancement. Special efforts were made in
the area of agriculture information dissemination, extension work, and research, which resulted in wide adoption
of agricultural methods conducive to the environment
and biodiversity. Emphasis was also placed on the sustainable management of natural resources, watersheds,
and areas that are sensitive to degradation such as
springs and mountain slopes as well as conservation of
soils and soil erosion control (e.g. in Burkina Faso and
Mauritania). This includes projects for rehabilitation of
basins suitable for flood recession crop cultivation (e.g. in
Mauritania), development of farmland, and management
of river basins.

Rural Infrastructure

Of the total loan and grant approvals for 2004, UA
675.7 million or 39.0 percent was allocated to infrastructure, which includes transportation, communication,
water supply and sanitation, and power supply. Projects
approved during the year included rural roads (e.g. in
Namibia), irrigation schemes (e.g. in Mauritania), and
water supply and sanitation project and studies (e.g.
in Morocco and Nigeria). Most of the road projects
approved for financing through ADB and ADF-IX resources in 2004 will connect agricultural production areas to
markets, reduce transportation costs, boost local and
regional trade, while facilitating access to social services
for the rural populations.

The Bank has also been at the forefront of the Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI) to support
water supply and sanitation projects, particularly in the
rural areas, with the goal of increasing access to a safe
supply of water and sanitation, and thus improve health

82 DP ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

Construction of the Bumbuna dam in Sierra Leone. This will provide electricity to
much of the country in addition to supporting tourism activities

and reduce poverty. The Bank has also been actively
involved in the establishment of the African Water
Facility (AWF) to raise about US$ 616 million to support
small-scale investment operations in the area of water
supply and sanitation. In addition, the Bank is providing
leadership in the NEPAD Water Program for regional
water resources development (see section on “Water
Initiatives” below).

The Bank recognizes that poor financial services also
pose a major constraint to the support of agriculture
and rural development in Africa. Consequently, the Bank
formulated in 2002 the Rural Finance Policy Guidelines
(RFPG), which assist Bank staff and RMCs in the design
and implementation of more sustainable financial services through improved rural financial intermediation.
Since the adoption of the RFPG in 2002, most projects
in the agriculture and rural development portfolio have
included an element of microfinance to provide rural
households, especially women, with credit for their economic empowerment.

SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT

Several developments and natural disasters influenced the
nature of funding and assistance provided during 2004.
First, there was increased availability of grants to support
social development, which targeted the following areas:
emergency assistance to victims of flood, cyclones, and
earthquake; to support HIV/AIDS operations; to support basic education (including adult education); and
for capacity building in both the education and healthsectors. Second, there was a renewed focus on ensuring
that projects and programs financed by the Bank in these
sectors have monitorable indicators, to make it easier
to evaluate or measure the results on ground and their
development effectiveness. A third and recent emphasis
has been support to regional initiatives, given that some
of the worst social development problems facing Africa
today, such as HIV/AIDS, are transboundary issues and
can only be adequately addressed through a concerted
regional effort.

The catalytic role of the social sector in improving the
living standards of the poor, particularly the rural poor,
and in the empowerment of rural women, has long
been acknowledged. The Bank's funding to this sector in
2004 aimed principally to reduce existing huge gender
differential in access to social services. It also targeted
the previously disadvantage individuals and remote rural
population groups (e.g. the migrant population in the
Sahelian region of Northern part of Africa).

During 2004 the Bank Group approved loans and grants
for 29 operations in the social sector amounting to UA
157.1 million, which represents 9.1 percent of the entire
lending for the year. For the concessionary and nonconcessionary windows, approvals to the social sector in
2004 amounted to UA 155.8 million and UA 1.3 million
respectively, which is a 52.8 percent decrease from the
Bank Group approvals to this sector in 2003. In cumulative terms, the Bank Group lending to the social sector
for the period 1967-2004 was UA 4.06 million or 11.6
percent of total lending.

 

Education

Consonant with its Education Policy, the Bank Group
continues to focus support on basic and vocational/adult
education and training. In the area of basic education,
the Bank actively seeks to promote the MDG of universal
primary education by the year 2015, and particularly to
redress the gender disparity in primary school enrollment.
The Bank continues to support the other subsectors of
education such as secondary education, technical and
vocational training. In line with its approved Guidelines
for the Utilization of SWAps, the Bank is progressively
supporting the Education For All-Fast Track Initiative
(EFA-FTI) in many countries, especially in Burkina Faso,
Cameroon, Chad, DRC, Mali, and Niger.

In 2004 the Bank Group approved loans and grants for
9 education projects and programs totaling UA 39.76

million or 2.3 percent of all lending for 2004. The interventions in the education subsector are guided by the
following key objectives:

¢ Improve access to integrated basic education through

enhanced management of schools, improved school

infrastructure and environment, and strengthening
he quality of teachers, as in the Chad Education

Sector Support IV Project (UA 2.4 million), the Cape

Verde Education Sector Institutional Support Project

(UA 1 million), and the DRC Education Sector Support

Project (UA 5.2 million);

e Increase access to quality secondary education,

increase the intake capacity, and improve the equity,

as in the cases of Djibouti Education Ill Strengthening

Project (UA 4.6 million) and the Eritrea Education
Sector Development Project (UA 13.6 million);

e Assist in establishing Open, Distance and eLearning
(ODeL) capacity development centers and connectivity provision at Africa Virtual University (AVU) partner
institutions to support teacher training and development programs and to mainstream gender issues, as
in the AVU Support Project (UA 5.0 million).

 

Health

On the basis of its Health Sector Policy, which embodies
the HIV/AIDS and malaria control strategy, the emphasis
is on access to quality healthcare facilities in both rural
and urban areas, the control of communicable diseases
(e.g. HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs),
malaria, etc.), human resource development and capacity building, and emergency humanitarian assistance to
the victims of natural disasters. In addition to primary
healthcare, attention is focused on nutrition and basic
health counseling, and the supply of essential drugs and
basic equipment.

During 2004 the Bank Group approved 13 projects and
programs in the health subsector for UA 102.0 million,
representing 5.9 percent of total lending for the year. The
13 operations are supported entirely from ADF resources
of which 9 are grants (UA 44.8 million) and 4 are loans
(UA 57.2 million). Overall, the Bank's funding of projects
and programs in the health subsector represents 64.9
percent of all approvals for the social sector. The Bank's
interventions in this subsector are based on a number of
key objectives, namely to:

¢ Provide funding to prevent the spread and transmission
of HIV/AIDS and STIs among refugees and migrant

populations, provide them with access to quality preventive and curative services, and psychological support to those living with HIV/AIDS, as in (i) the 2004
approved multinational grant for the Subregional HIV/
AIDS Program for the Refugees, Internally Displaced
Populations and their Host Communities in the Mano
River Union Countries and Céte d'Ivoire (UA 5.0 million)
and (ii) the multinational grant for the Regional Initiative
for HIV/AIDS/STI Prevention in Member Countries of the
Indian Ocean Commission (UA 6.0 million).

e Reduce the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate in some countries, improve services for testing, counseling and
provision of anti-retroviral drugs, and strengthen
women’s competence vis-a-vis HIV/AIDS, as in the
case of the ADF grant of UA 8.3 million to Mali’s
HIV/AIDS Control Project.

in general, and in particular for the most vulnerable
groups, through the strengthening of district health
systems, the prevention and control of major diseases
and project management, as in the case of the loan

BOX 4.3
The New Private Sector Development Strategy

In 2004 the Boards of Directors of the ADB Group approved
the new Private Sector Development Strategy. The new strategy acknowledges the essential role played by the private
Sector in promoting economic growth and poverty reduction.
Small and medium enterprises, which constitute the majority
of the private concerns, are job-creating and income-generating sources of revenue not only for households, but also for
the government to invest in social development.

The main objective of the strategy is to scale up the capacity and
effectiveness of the Bank Group in promoting the development
of a viable private sector in the RMCs. This requires a Bankwide approach by providing strategic orientations and outlining
responsibilities for the Bank's private and public sector departments. This strategy is consonant with the 3 overarching goals of
the Bank's Strategic Plan, namely: ownership of the private sector development process by the recipient countries; partnership
with development agencies and their economic operators; and
selectivity of sectors of intervention, as defined by the Bank's
Country Strategy Papers (CSPs). The strategy identifies the following key areas for effective private sector development:

* Creating an enabling business environment so as to stimulate a sound investment climate for investors, both local and
foreign, by assisting RMC governments in the reform of their
regulatory and legal frameworks;

* Strengthening financial systems by assisting RMCs to develop sound banking systems, to create or expand capital markets, and to diversify non-banking financial products such as
leasing, franchising, mortgaging, and insurance;

 

* Building competitive physical and social infrastructure which
represents a cornerstone for the promotion of public-private partnerships (PPPs), through the broadening of financial options, supporting training for business skills, and
brokering PPPs for basic services;

¢ Promoting trade by stimulating trade liberalization and
diversification through the removal or reduction of subsidies
and other tariff and non-tariff barriers. Furthermore, the
Bank will be assisting the RMCs’ trade promotion policies
by supporting the financial capacity of local trade financing
institutions and in contributing to finance large, medium
and small export-oriented enterprises.

During 2005-2007 the Bank's Private Sector Development
Strategy will seek to structure its indicative cumulative volume
of approvals according to the following proportions:

Financial intermediation 35%
© Infrastructure and public-private partnerships (PPPs) 29%
* Sector reform 24%
© Direct lending to private enterprises 8%
¢ Advocacy for free market access 3%
Social sector 1%

The strategy focuses on institutional and structural reforms
in this area, rather than simply lending to the African private
sector, as these are mainstreamed in the Bank’s overall operational program (for example, as lines of credit for onlending
to SMEs).

 

 

84 ~\ ANNUAL REPORT 2004© Create sustainable tsetse fly and trypanosomiasis-free
(T&T) areas in 6 countries in Sub-Saharan East and
Western African countries. This is in support of the
eradication of T&T through integrating suppression,
control, and eradication technologies while ensuring
that the reclaimed areas are economically exploitable.
(See Box 4.2.)
In the health subsector, the Bank Group seeks to harmonize its operations in partnership with UN agencies.
In 2004 it collaborated with the UNFPA and UNESCO
to provide funding for the National Reproductive Health
Support Program in Cameroon (UA 12.1 million, or 88.9
percent of the total cost). With regard to the fight against
communicable diseases, the Bank is collaborating with
the UNFPA and other specialized agencies to complement
their work.

PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

With low savings rates, capital flight, inadequate foreign
direct investment, and a private sector that is predominantly informal, Africa presents a daunting challenge to
robust private sector development. Nonetheless, development of the private sector is essential for effective poverty
reduction and, as such, is a key component of the Bank's
Vision and Strategic Plan.

In December 2004 the Boards approved the Private
Sector Development Strategy of the African Development
Bank Group. The strategy of intervention focuses on
creating the conditions and building the capacities (i.e.
institutional, human, legal, and governance structures)
needed to attract investment in the private sector. This
requires, first of all, mainstreaming private sector development considerations into all aspects of the Bank's development activities, whether they be lending or non-lending
operations, directed at the public, private, or public/private
sectors.

Quality-at-entry, backed by due diligence, will govern
each operation supported by the Bank, and these will be
selected on the basis of their development impact and
cost effectiveness. At country and regional levels, the
Bank will assist both the public and private sector working together to address jointly the challenges that the
country or the region is facing. The new SRFID provides
UA 2.8 million for the implementation of the Private
Sector Development Strategy for the period 2005-2007
to be approved by installments annually through the
budgeting process (see Box 4.3).

Operational Priorities and Effectiveness

2004 Bank Funding to the Private Sector

During 2004 the Bank continued to record a high volume
of private sector operations for a total of UA 166.0
million. The approvals included 4 lines of credit (LOCs)
amounting to UA 161.2 million, 1 equity participation
or UA 3.2 million and one grant for UA 1.6 million to
ATMS Ill / AMSCO. South Africa received 2 LOCs of UA
117.1 million, channeled through Nedcor Ltd. One LOC
or UA 112.5 million was for investment in viable private
sector projects in Southern Africa, while the Franchising
Program for UA 4.5 million was to promote franchising
as a business strategy, to develop SMEs amongst previously disadvantaged individuals. Botswana benefited for
he first time since the inception of Bank's private sector
operations from an LOC to the National Development
Bank (NDB) for an amount of UA 34.3 million, including
a technical assistance component for capacity building.
The Bank’s facility is to be onlent to NDB's corporate clients and enterprises in various sectors of the economy.
The fourth LOC was granted to Kenya Commercial Bank
(KCB) for an amount of UA 9.8 million, including technical assistance for capacity building. This medium-term
based facility is to be onlent to KCB’s corporate clients
with the objective to support enterprise expansion and
rehabilitation projects with strong foreign currency
income streams, principally SMEs in various sectors.

 

 

Regarding the private sector equity window, the Bank
extended, with cross-border scope, an amount of UA 3.2
million to increase its share capital contribution in the
Africa Reinsurance Corporation (Africa-Re), a company
involved in the insurance and reinsurance industry in
Africa. The objective of the Bank's additional subscription
is to contribute to the strengthening of the capital base
of the company.

Non-Lending Activities

Under non-lending activities, the private sector window in
2004 took an active part in the preparation of the Bank's
Country Strategy Papers, addressing in particular issues
related to private sector development. Also during the
year, work commenced on Private Sector Country Profiles
for 3 countries (Algeria, Egypt, and Mali) and these will
be completed in 2005. In full partnership between the
Bank's public and private sector windows, a program to
support the structural adjustment of the private sector in
Senegal (PAASP Senegal) was also launched in 2004. In
the near future this type of coordinated approach will be
intensified and developed for other countries, in line with
the new Private Sector Development Strategy.

Operational Priorities and Effectiveness

During the year under review, the Bank continued to
use its concessional resources to help improve SMEs’
Operating conditions. The ADF provided the ATMS/
AMSCO (African Training Management Services/African
Management Service) program with a grant of UA 1.6
million to improve managerial skills in SMEs. In parallel,
work continued to develop specific programs targeting
SMEs to ease conditions under which they may access
inancing, through mechanisms that effectively tackle
he adverse risk perception of local banks. During the
year under review, the first program on “Franchising
‘o Support Previously Disadvantaged Groups of South
Africa” was finalized.

he Bank also carried out jointly with the International
Labor Organization (ILO) an assessment of the business environment for women entrepreneurs in 3 East

ee

African countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania). This
represents the first in a country series exercise, to help
design assistance instruments to foster women entrepreneurship. These assessments will be used in Multisector
Gender Country Profiles as well in the PSCPs and CSPs.
Another initiative for which work is well advanced is the
Corporate Governance Program: this exercise will result
in a strategy and plan of action that will guide Bank
activities in this area.

The ADB is a cofinancier of the SASOL Natural Gas Project in
Mozambique, which was approved in 2003 for implementation over a 21-month period. The Bank is contributing a loan
of UA 55.6 million to the project's total cost of UA 858.9
million. The project involves the upstream development of the
gas fields of Temane and Pande in the northeastern region of
Mozambique, construction of a central processing facility and
an 860-km gas pipeline from Mozambique to South Africa.
The project is in line with the Bank's objective to promote private sector development in Mozambique, particularly the vast
gas resources of the country. It is also in line with its Private
Sector Development Strategy, which focuses on cofinancing
operations with African development finance institutions in
national and cross-border investments.

 

 

Developing Mozambique’s Untapped Natural Resources: The SASOL Natural Gas Project

The project provides strong economic impetus for both South
Africa and Mozambique and contributes to promoting regional
economic integration. SASOL has embarked on the commercialization of the Mozambican natural gas, construction of new
chemical plants, in addition to the expansion and/or optimization of existing production facilities in South Africa.

Economic benefits will accrue to both countries in the form of
revenues, direct and indirect employment creation, and other
spin-offs. Capital investment in the gas project contributes
to higher economic growth for both countries, especially
Mozambique. The gas project is a substantial addition to the
country’s infrastructure, such as access roads to the pipeline,
ancillary infrastructure (roads to the gas fields, potable water
supply, and de-mining of project area, including the pipeline
route), and increased exploration activity.

During the project's expected 25-year lifespan, Mozambique is
expected to earn about US$ 2.1 billion in taxes and royalties,
increasing the country’s GDP by an estimated 10 percent. The
project has also set up a Social Development Fund of US$ 6.0
million designed to provide development assistance to communities within areas in Mozambique that are potentially affected
by the project's infrastructure. The Fund is being used mainly for
the provision of boreholes and clean water, clinics, schools, agriculture, gas and electricity supply, and roads for local communities. In South Africa, SASOL has set up social development funds
for assistance to local communities, in addition to allocating
ownership in the project to black empowerment enterprises.BOX 4.5

Infrastructure, Governance, Banking and Financial Standards
- The ADB Spearheading Progress in NEPAD Implementation

In November 2001, the Heads of State and Government
Implementation Committee (HSGIC) of NEPAD requested the
Bank to assume a lead role and provide technical assistance
and advisory services in support of 2 main areas: (i) infrastructure and (ii) banking and financial standards. To implement its
NEPAD mandate, the Bank has put in place the necessary institutional arrangements, including establishment of a NEPAD
Support Unit within its organizational structure. In addition,
the Boards of Directors approve yearly administrative budgets
of approximately US$ 1.5 million to fund the Bank's technical
and logistic support to NEPAD-related activities.

Support to Infrastructure Development

During the fiscal year 2004, much of the emphasis on the infrastructure sector aimed, in the case of ADB countries, to support
and enhance the economic competitiveness of these countries
and assist them to manage their water resources within an integrated framework. Examples of such projects include the Transport
Sector Adjustment Program in Morocco, the Road Project in
Tunisia, and the Water and Sanitation Project in Morocco. In ADF
countries, emphasis was laid on the provision of basic infrastructure services in rural areas, as illustrated by the road project on
Zanzibar Island in Tanzania, the Small Towns Water Supply and
Sanitation Project in Uganda, and the Rift Valley Water Supply
and Sanitation Project in Kenya. Regional integration and NEPAD
objectives were also promoted through 2 multinational projects
in power and one in transportation, one study in power as well
as through the Kamanjab-Omakange road project in Namibia,
which links the country to Angola. Public-private partnerships
were also strongly supported in several projects, including the
Transport Sector Adjustment Program in Morocco and the
Mineral Resources Management and Capacity-Building Project in
Uganda, which are expected to foster an environment conducive
to private sector investments in both countries.

The Bank has adopted a two-pronged approach to the NEPAD
infrastructure development program: a Short-term Action Plan
(STAP) to be complemented by a Medium- to Long-term Strategic
Framework (MLTSF). The Bank developed the STAP as a first stage
in the prioritization of its infrastructural program under NEPAD,
in consultation with RECs and development partners, namely
the World Bank and European Union. The STAP focused wider
attention on the critical infrastructure requirements of the continent and on the necessary policy, regulatory, and institutional
measures to ensure the efficiency of existing and planned regional
infrastructure assets. This was complemented by about 124 projects and programs (18 for capacity building, 52 for facilitation,
36 investment, and 18 technical studies) for a total financing of
over US$ 8.13 billion. These key projects and programs were proposed by the RECs to kick-start the implementation of the NEPAD
agenda in infrastructure development for the period 2002-2007.

Within the NEPAD framework, during 2002-2004, the Bank
Group financed 12 physical projects, including one private
sector project, and 8 studies for a total amount of US$ 520
million, in addition to mobilizing about US$ 1.6 billion in
cofinancing. For the year 2005, the Bank will be considering
7 physical projects, 1 capacity-building project, and 3 studies estimated at about US$ 500 million. Through the NEPAD
Infrastructure Preparation Facility (with seed funding of C$ 10
million provided by the Government of Canada), RMCs and
regional communities are able to sponsor technical studies for
identification of viable infrastructure projects.

Support to Economic and Corporate Governance

During the first phase of its activities in the area of economic and
corporate governance, the Bank developed the Framework for
the Implementation of Banking and Financial Standards under
NEPAD. The Bank also identified and submitted indicators and
criteria for the assessments of banking and financial standards
to the APRM Secretariat. These served as inputs to the drafting
of the indicators and benchmarks for the African Peer Review
Mechanism (APRM). The second phase of the Bank Group's
support to financial standards consists in the development of
country assessments. In the third phase, the Bank Group will
assist countries to formulate and implement plans of actions to
correct weaknesses in compliance with the standards.

The Bank and the other strategic partners are also providing
basic economic and governance data on the countries of
the APRM to facilitate preparation for the assessments. To
help countries prepare for the self-assessments and technical
assessments, the Bank together with other strategic partners,
is participating in country support missions, which are being
organized by the APRM Secretariat. The missions evaluate the
independence of the process and mechanisms put in place by
the countries to undertake self-assessments and to prepare
their preliminary Programs of Action. They also assess and
advise on the proposed involvement of stakeholders.

As part of its institutional support to the APRM, the Bank is also
financing a position of Corporate Governance Expert at the APRM
Secretariat. It has also made a contribution of US$ 100,000 to
help finance the country assessments of the APRM. Furthermore,
the Bank Group will involve the Association of African Central
Banks in the technical assessments of compliance with banking
and financial standards, as part of its effort to enhance stakeholder ownership of the process. In this connection, the Bank
organized a workshop in Johannesburg from November 29 to
December 1, 2004 on the “Framework for the Implementation
of Capital Adequacy Standards and Good Corporate Governance
in African Banks” with assistance from the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York and the Financial Stability Institute.

reduce poverty. Regional integration and cooperation create larger markets, improve infrastructure and linkages
between producers and customers, and promote economies of scale that will allow Africa to become more competitive in the international marketplace. With the trend
toward regionalism and globalization, regional economic
blocs serve as vehicles to help integrate regional markets
into the larger global trading arena. The Bank operations focus on regional institutional capacity building;
the development of regional infrastructure; policy-based
operations aimed at harmonizing macroeconomic policy;
trade liberalization and creating the appropriate conditions for regional private sector development; and the
promotion of sustainable development at the regional
level. The Bank's allocation of resources for multinational projects serves as a catalyst to mobilize investment
resources from other development partners.

Collaboration with NEPAD and the ECA

NEPAD, which is an African-led initiative to promote
the continent's development, serves as the political and
economic basis for each region's development agenda.
The Bank has been designated as the lead agency for
promoting NEPAD programs in infrastructure development and banking and financial standards (see Box 4.5).
A dedicated NEPAD Support Unit was established within
the Bank's organizational structure in December 2003 to
work full-time on NEPAD-related activities, as well as to
advance the NEPAD ideals in its RMCs and provide support to the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM).

The NEPAD Infrastructure Project Preparation Facility
(NEPAD-IPPF), which was approved by the Bank in
December 2003, has been established with seed funding of C$ 10 million from the Government of Canada.
NEPAD-IPPF is to be transformed into a multi-donor facility, to which the Government of Denmark has already
made a contribution of US$ 500,000. The Guidelines
for the Utilization of the IPPF. which have been prepared
and disseminated to all the regional economic communities (RECs) and to specialized infrastructure development agencies as well as all African countries, were
formally launched during the Tenth Heads of State and
Government Implementation Committee (HSGIC) meeting in Maputo, Mozambique, in May 2004.

The Bank was also requested by NEPAD to collaborate
with the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) on
economic governance issues, and especially on the country assessments. As part of its assistance to the APRM,

the Bank will help countries in drawing up action plans
to address weaknesses in economic and corporate governance. It will also provide technical assistance and financial support (including policy-based loans and grants) to
support the implementation of action plans to improve
economic and corporate governance.

he Boards of the Bank Group approved a total budget of
UA 7.4 million for the implementation of regional initiaives for the 2003-2007 period, to include NEPAD and the
Water Initiative program.

Multinational Operations Approved during 2004
During the year 2004 the Bank Group continued to
extend loans and grants for 24 operations to support
regional integration on the continent in the priority
sectors of agriculture and rural development (9 operaions), infrastructure (transportation, communications,
power, and water supply and sanitation — 6 operations);
social sector (health, HIV/AIDS and education - 4 operaions) and multisector (5 operations). The total amount
approved from the ADF window for multinational projects/ programs rose from UA 129.4 million in 2003 to
UA 217.7 million in 2004, representing an increase of
68.2 percent. This indicates the growing demand for
regional project financing, boosted by major regional
development initiatives as well as demand from RECs.

 

Most of the multinational infrastructure studies and projects financed during the year are within the framework
defined by the NEPAD initiative and accord with the
objectives stated in the NEPAD Short-Term Action Plan
(STAP) for infrastructure. The NEPAD-STAP, which was
prepared by the Bank Group, focuses on integrating and
interconnecting the African infrastructure networks, in
order to boost Africa’s competitiveness in the global market. In this regard, special emphasis has been placed on
projects and programs designed for the development of
international transportation corridors linking landlocked
countries with seaports. The aim of such projects and
programs is to promote seamless transportation while
reducing costs for land-locked countries, such as:

e The multinational project to link, by road, Addis Ababa
and Southern Ethiopia to the port of Mombasa,
through the construction of part of the Isiolo-Moyale
road section (ADF loan of UA 33.6 million; ADF grant
of UA 2.55 million); and

e The Feasibility Study on the Isaka-Kigali Railroad
Project, which aims to open up Rwanda and promote
trade (ADF grant of UA 1.66 million).The improvement of power supply systems through a

regional approach is another area of focus for regional

integration by the Bank Group. In 2004 approvals for

multinational power programs included:

© The interconnection of national power grids, such
as in the Ethiopia—Djibouti Power Interconnection
Project (ADF loan of UA 38.5 million), whereby the
development of power pools is promoted, to allow
countries to benefit from economies of scale and
reduce fuel import costs; and

© The promotion of regional power trade through the
creation of an enabling environment and coordinated
planning and development of power generation and

ransmission interconnection projects, such as Eastern

Nile Power Trade Program (ENTRO) Study (ADF grant

of UA 2.6 million).

Multinational projects and programs in the area of agri
culture and rural development in 2004 focussed on:

© Preserving regional agricultural assets, fisheries devel
opment, and environmental protection, such as the

Project to Support the Lake Tanganyika Integrated

Regional Development Program (PRODAP) (ADF loan

of UA 20.0 million);

e Enhancing food security, such as the Eastern Nile

rrigation and Drainage Study (ADF grant of UA 1.8

million); and

e |mproving agricultural marketing information and

agribusiness opportunities, as in the Agricultural

jarketing Promotion and Regional Integration Project

‘or COMESA (ADF grant of UA 3.74 million).

¢ Building capacity in integrated water management,
as in the Integrated Management of Invasive Aquatic
Weeds in West Africa (ADF loan 10.2 million; ADF
grant UA 2.00 million) which covers 8 countries.

 

During the year, the Bank continued to provide support
for regional social initiatives. In the health subsector, this
was through enhanced participation in the fight against
HIV/AIDS/STIs, as in the Regional Initiative for Indian
Ocean Commission member countries (ADF grant UA
6.0 million) and Mano River Union Basin countries and
the Céte d'Ivoire HIV/AIDS program (UA 5.0 million); also
in the creation of tsetse and trypanosomiasis (T&T) free
areas across 6 countries to help eradicate “sleeping sickness" (see Box 4.2). The latter is envisaged as an eventual
continent-wide program (ADF loan of UA 44.6 million;
ADF grant of UA 2.94 million).

n the education subsector, approval was given in support of Open, Distance and eLearning (ODeL) Capacity
Development Centers at African Virtual University (AVU)
partner institutions. This fulfills the Bank's objective to
help build human capacity for adult learning; a further
component of this project is to assist in teacher training
rograms (ADF grant of UA 5.0 million).

Another vital role that regional cooperation and integration can play in the overall development agenda is
‘o support peace efforts and create a climate that is
conducive to economic growth, social development, and
domestic and international investment. In 2004 the ADF
Board approved UA 10.0 million to support the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Peace and
Development Program. This aims to strengthen the instiutional capacities of ECOWAS and civil society in counries affected by conflict and to assist in the coordination
and implementation of conflict prevention measures.

n 2004 the Bank extended financial support for capacity-building operations in RECs, river basin organizaions, and other sectoral regional associations as well as
‘or countries participating in regional initiatives. These
included: support to RECs such as Autorité du LiptakoGourma (ALG) Institutional Support Project (ADF grant
of UA 1.6 million); Institutional Support Project for the
General Secretariat of the Economic Community of
the Central African States (ECCAS) (ADF grant of UA
2.6 million); strengthening of the capital base of panAfrican insurance company through participation in the
Third Capital Increase of Africa Reinsurance Corporation
(Africa-Re) (ADB loan of UA 3.2 million); and Statistical
Capacity Building in RMCs under the International
Comparison Program (ICP) for Africa (ADF grant of UA
14.8 million). Furthermore, the Bank has also started the
preparation of a Regional Integration Assistance Strategy
(RIAS) in the SADC subregion, to better focus its multinational assistance.

 

WATER INITIATIVES

The development of Africa’s water resources has become
one of the key objectives of the Bank's development
efforts on the continent. African annual renewable
water resources, which are estimated at about 5,400
billion m? per year, are considered to be abundant. These
water resources are characterized by extreme temporal
and spatial variability with over 60 shared water basins

dominating the landscape. However, the exploitation of
water resources is low with only about 3 percent of the
total amount used under managed condition. Africa is
therefore faced with the major challenge of achieving
significant development of its water resources to ensure
sustained economic growth and social wellbeing.

The social cost of Africa's poor exploitation of its water
resources is well documented. Currently about 300 million people in Africa do not have access to safe water and
about 313 million have no access to sanitation. Most of
Africa's population live in rural areas (62 percent) and yet
access is lowest in the rural areas, at about 47 percent for
water and 45 percent for sanitation. Low access to a safe
water supply and adequate sanitation is the root cause
of many diseases that afflict Africa and a contributory
factor to the high infant and maternal mortality rates in
many RMCs. The World Health Organization (WHO) has
reported that approximately 50 percent of all Africans
suffer from one of 6 water-related diseases.

It was in response to the enormity of these challenges
that the African Water Vision for 2025 and the associated Framework for Action were presented at the Second
World Water Forum in 2000. A consensus emerged at
the Forum that a transboundary approach was needed that would incorporate an integrated watercourse
management strategy. This would require considerable
resources and full collaboration and commitment by
the international donor community, RMCs, NGOs, and
bilateral partners.

The Bank Group’s Water Initiatives

The Bank Group has over 37 years accumulated a broad
experience of water resources management in Africa. In
2000 the Bank Group developed an Integrated Water
Resources Management (IWRM) Policy, which drew
from the Bank's experience in this sector. The key lesson that has emerged is the need for a comprehensive
and integrated approach to unlock the full benefits of
sustainable water management for poverty reduction
and economic growth. The IWRM recognizes that water
has an ecological, social, and economic use and that
water management has to be optimized within these
systems. The Bank has been actively involved in a number
of major policy instruments, namely the NEPAD Water
Resources Management Program, the Rural Water Supply
and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI), and the African Water
Facility (AWF). The salient features of these 3 initiatives
are set out in Table 4.1.

Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI)

The Bank conceived the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Initiative (RWSSI) in response to the challenge of supporting the water-related MDGs and the African Water Vision
targets, as well as addressing the problem of low access
to water supply and sanitation in rural Africa. The overall
goal of the RWSSI is poverty reduction through the provision of safe water and basic sanitation to 80 percent of
the rural populations in Africa by 2015, with eventual
100 percent coverage by 2025, as stated in the MDGs.
The attainment of these targets will require cumulative
investments estimated at about US$ 14.2 billion. Theseresources would need to be mobilized from international
sources to cover approximately 80 percent of the overall
requirements (30 percent through ADF replenishment
and 50 percent from other bilateral and multilateral
donors) with the remaining 20 percent financed from
government resources (15 percent) and beneficiaries (5
percent).

The Bank is currently organizing the first International
Donors’ Conference, which will be held with the support
of the French authorities on April 1, 2005 in Paris. The
Bank has undertaken several missions to major donor
countries to seek support and prepare the groundwork
for the conference, whose theme is, “Achieving the
Millennium Development Goals on Water Supply and
Sanitation in Rural Africa.”

African Water Facility (AWF)

The African Water Facility (AWF) is led by the African
Ministers’ Council on Water (AMCOW) and seeks to
improve the enabling environment and strengthen water
resources management so as to attract the massive investments necessary to achieve the regional objectives. The
AWF aims to raise about US$ 615.7 million, of which
some US$ 2.5 million will be allocated to organization and
administration, US$ 170 million to facilitation activities,
and US$ 434 million to capital investments. An indicative
medium-term action program for the period 2005-2009
has been developed to guide this effort. To date, the following pledges and contributions have been made:

 

{Operational Priorities and Effectiveness _}

© Canada has approved C$ 20 million in total, of which
C$ 10 million has already been made available;

© The European Commission has approved a total contribution of € 20 million from its own EU/ACP Water
Facility over approximately 2 years and has indicated
that it is open to additional contributions immediately
thereafter;

e France has approved € 12 million over 5 years;

© Norway has indicated its intention to contribute € 1.5
million per annum for 3 years (this is currently being
submitted for approval);

e Sweden, Denmark, and Austria have given positive signals of their intention to contribute, but no
approval has yet been issued;

e Japan has signaled its intention to make a contribution through its trust fund at the Bank.

The Facility has been established as a Special Water Fund
managed by the Bank. The Bank is preparing the operational documents including the operations manual, work
program, staffing plan, rules and regulations, and model
agreements for contributing donors. Procurement and
disbursement will be conducted by applying fast-track
procedures in accordance with the Rules of the Bank.

NEPAD Water Resources Management Program

At the continental level, NEPAD provides the overarching
framework for directing water resources development
efforts to achieve the strategic goal of ensuring water
security across the whole of Africa. The Bank has the

ead responsibility to assist NEPAD to implement its water
and sanitation infrastructure development program with
a view to enhancing regional integration. A 5-year shorterm action plan (STAP) has been prepared which includes
he development of national integrated water resources
management (IWRM) policies; mitigation of floods and
droughts; meeting basic needs, and management of
ransboundary water resources. The implementation of

STAP has focused on 7 river basins, i.e. the Rivers Niger
and Senegal in West Africa; River Congo and Lake Chad
in Central Africa; River Nile in East Africa; and Rivers
Zambezi and Okavango in Southern Africa. The Bank is
also assisting NEPAD in the formulation of the mediumto long-term strategic framework (MLTSF) for Water and
Sanitation Infrastructure Program.

 

BOX 4.6

The African Development Bank Group hosted its first Water
Week in July 2004, in Tunis. This event testified to the Bank’s
continued commitment to this vital sector, in its drive to meet
the MDG of providing 80 percent access to a sustainable
water supply and safe sanitation by the year 2015, with 100
percent coverage by the year 2025. Progress in this sector is
inextricably linked to the Bank’s twin overarching goals of poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth and will have
synergistic beneficial effects across a range of sectors such as
health, education, energy, agriculture and environment.

In response to the daunting challenges facing the management and development of water resources in Africa, the ADB
has spearheaded a number of water sector activities with the
most significant being the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Initiative, the Africa Water Facility, and the NEPAD Water
Resources Management Program. The Water Week provided
the venue for Bank staff and various stakeholders to come
together and exchange ideas, experiences, and best practices
on the water agenda.

The Water Week attracted 422 participants from 60 countries,
including 17 African Ministers responsible for water resources
development. Participants were drawn from government agencies, water sector professionals from NGOs, universities and
research institutions, river basin organizations, and private and
public organizations. International organizations active in the
water sector, including the WHO, UNICEF UN-HABITAT, the
International Water Management Institute, the Global Water
Partnership, together with multilateral and bilateral donors,
participated in the Water Week. The theme of the event was
“Building Partnerships for Water in Africa”. It aimed to engage
the stakeholders in the African water sector to forge partnerships around the Bank's major initiatives as well as to galvanize
broad support for concerted action to advance sustainable
water resources management and development in Africa.

The highlight of the Opening Session, which was also addressed
by the Bank President, was the official launching of the RWSSI

 

The First Water Week of the Bank Group: “Building Partnerships for Water in Africa”

and the AWE, the 2 major water initiatives in which the Bank
Group takes a leading role. This was followed by the keynote
speech by Dr. Bill Cosgrove, President of the World Water
Council. The rest of the day was devoted to presentations and
far-ranging discussions on how to work toward achieving the
water MDGs in Africa as well as water security challenges and
responses in light of the Infrastructure Action Plans of NEPAD.

The second day was devoted to a series of parallel technical
sessions designed to provide a forum for in-depth deliberation of the 3 main program components of the Water Week:
“Water Supply and Sanitation,” “Financing Water Initiatives”
and “Water Resources Development.” The last day was
devoted to progress reports on major global and African water
programs: The World Water Assessment Program (WVVAP),
the African Water Resources Development Report, and the
Outcome of the Commission on Sustainable Development
(CSD) Conference and its Implications for Africa. Highlights on
preparations for the Fourth World Water Forum were provided
in this session.

A number of conclusions emerged from the discussion sesSions, viz.:

¢ It is vital to secure the engagement and political commitment of the Governments or specialized government agencies during the development of the World Water Assessment
Program (WWAP);

There should be an increased involvement of NGOs and
CSOs in subsequent Water Weeks;

The role of applied research and related topics should be
included in subsequent Water Weeks;

The major challenge facing the water sector is how to close
the gap between the resources that are cited as “available”
and the full delivery of services on the ground.

In addition to ADB resources, the Governments of the
Netherlands, Norway, Canada as well as the UN-HABITAT and
the World Bank Water and Sanitation Program made financial
contributions to the organization of the Water Week.

 

 

92 > ANNUAL REPOWater Partnership Program
The Water Partnership Program was established with
assistance from The Netherlands Government to promote
integrated water management principles and practices
in the RMCs and to support the implementation of the
IWRM Policy in Africa. The implementation of the
Program, which covers 3 years, commenced in 2003 with
a grant of US$ 5.0 million. The grant is being utilized to
(i) enhance the Bank's water operations capacity; (ii) build
awareness and capacity in the RMCs; (iii) develop water
information and public awareness; and (iv) participate
in partnerships and exchange best practices and experiences in RMCs. Canada has agreed to support the water
partnership program by availing C$ 5 million over a 3year period, starting from 2004.

 

The program has enabled the Bank to develop the African
Water Facility and the Framework for the implementation
of the pilot phase program for RWSSI. It has supported
regional and international advocacy work and enabled
the Bank to participate in the collaborative program on
agricultural water use with the World Bank, FAO, IFAD,
and IWMI under the NEPAD framework.

Coordination and Collaborative Activities
The Bank will take a lead role in the implementation of
RWSSI by coordinating the efforts of donors and other
partners around a common program, ensuring a synchronized response in meeting the challenges, and facilitating
a harmonized approach to program implementation. The
Bank will also establish a Water Coordinating Committee
to provide the Secretariat functions for the implementation of the various initiatives.

Coordination at the national level will be primarily achieved
through the PRSPs. The mechanisms for developing the
PRSPs involve discussion of the national programs of the
various institutions, governments, donors, MDBs, and
NGOs and ensuring their accommodation within the
overall country IWRM plan. The coordination of Bank
operations will be ensured through the CSPs and Regional
Assistance Strategy Papers, where Bank commitments to
national and regional programs are determined.

 

The establishment of AMCOW and its involvement in
the AWF has provided a good opportunity to ensure
that all the programs to be supported by RWSSI,
the NEPAD Water Program, and AWF fit into the
national and regional programs of the RMCs, along
with the support programs of the donor community.

Operational Priorities and Effectiveness

The Bank, together with other regional and international partners, has coordinated and participated in
regional and international forums such as the World
Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), the World
Water Forum, and World Panel on Financing Water
Infrastructure. In addition, UN Water Africa will have a
significant coordinating role among UN agencies and
with other stakeholders.

The Bank Group's commitment to water initiatives and
the importance attached to this by the Bank Group,
its development partners, and RMCs, was well demonstrated by the First ADB Water Week, which was held in
Tunis in July 2004 (see Box 4.6). The Water Week aimed
at engaging the stakeholders and partners in the African
water sector, consolidating existing partnerships and
creating new ones, as well as galvanizing broad support
from both stakeholders and the wider international community to advance African water resources development
and management. It was during the Water Week that the
RWSSI and AWF were officially launched.

GOOD GOVERNANCE

Whilst the primary mandate of the Bank is to contribute
to the economic development and social progress of
its RMCs, the Bank is also aware that it cannot fulfill
its objectives without the institutionalization of good
governance throughout the continent. This requires
adherence to the axioms of good governance both within
the development agency itself and also in the countries
of its operations. Consequently, the Bank has embarked
since 1995 on an evolving process of internal reform
with the aim of maximizing both the transparency of its
operations and its development effectiveness. The Bank
Group Policy on the Disclosure of Information, approved
in March 2004, is consonant with this approach.

Over the years, the Bank has also sharpened its focus
on issues pertaining to good governance in RMCs.
Governance issues that are of particular concern to the
Bank include the following:

e Ensuring the accountability of public agencies and
officials through formal transparent processes for
monitoring and reporting;

e Fostering transparency at all levels of government
and public administration, including budgetary transparency;

ANNUAL REPORT 2004

(3Operational Priorities and Effectiveness

© Combating corruption;

e Fostering greater participation and freedom of
speech and association, to enable the beneficiaries
of government programs to participate effectively in
determining and meeting their needs;

e Nurturing an objective and efficient judiciary; and

e Enhancing efficiency within public and private institutions by building both technical and management
capacities.

In operationalizing its agenda for good governance, the
Bank is guided by the RMC’s institutional capacity, and its
social and political situation. The objective in each case
is to help in the development of an enabling environment, taking into consideration all the economic and
non-economic factors, the effects of bad governance
on development performance, the imperative of country
ownership of development programs and policies, and
the commitment to effective partnership among government, private sector, civil society and the international
development community in the implementation of governance initiatives and activities.

The Bank Group Good Governance Policy and its
Implementation Guidelines, adopted by the Board in
1999 and 2001 respectively, provide the basis for
addressing governance issues facing RMCs in the Bank's
programs. It acknowledges the complexity of the governance concept and the interrelated nature of its different
components. Against this background, the Bank also
recognizes the need for a more differentiated approach
among countries. The issue of good governance continues to be a key criterion in the performance-based
allocation of ADF resources, with more resources going
to countries that achieve high governance ratings.

Good governance falls within the multisector category
of Bank operations, together with public sector management (including structural adjustment programs and
debt relief operations), private sector development,
anticorruption measures, institutional support, balance of
payments support, etc. Approvals for multisector operations as a whole amounted to UA 450.0 million in 2004,
or 26.0 percent of total approvals. Of these, 12 were
governance-related programs and projects amounting to
UA 93.7 million, or 20.8 percent of all approvals for the
multisector.

Other Bank activities in the governance subsector during
the course of the year centered on the preparation and

94 DP ANNUAL REPORT 2004

revision of operational policies and guidelines, ESW, and
other support activities to operations, participation in
training workshops, seminars and conferences, and other
collaborative activities.

Bank Group Policies, Guidelines, and Studies
Relating to Good Governance

In March 2004 the Board approved the Guidelines on
Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Bank
Operations. This document identifies areas where and
how corruption and fraud may occur in Bank operations
and delineates standards and procedures on how Bank
staff and other employees of Bank-supported activities
should respond to incidents of corruption and fraud.
Work on the Guidelines for Policy Based Lending in
Governance (PBLG) had begun in 2003 and was completed and approved by the Board in April 2004. The
Guidelines consolidate the mainstreaming of governance
in operations and provide directions on how to identify,
prepare, and appraise PBLG in accordance with the Bank
Group's standard review process and follow its implementation in partnership with the recipient RMC.

As part of the implementation process for its good
governance practices, the Bank Group's Board approved
in 2000 the Guidelines for Financial Management and
Financial Analysis of Projects. During 2004 work began
on revising and updating this policy document. Once
revised, it will become an essential tool that will improve
the efficiency of activities to promote good practice on
the financial governance of projects/programs and to
enhance the contribution of the Bank to RMCs' effort
to reduce poverty.

In 2004, 3 studies were initiated on Enhancing Effectiveness in Customs Administration, Local Service
Delivery and Pro-poor Outcomes, and Local Governance,
Decentralization and Capacity Building for Good
Governance. It is expected that on completion, the outcome of these studies will inform the programming and
activities of Bank operations. Work is also ongoing on
a Concept Paper on Decentralization, which aims to (i)
define the modalities and strategy for program work in
the area of decentralization and local governments and
(ii) enhance the efficiency of pro-poor decentralized and
local government institutions and their responsiveness
in providing basic services.

As part of the Bank's Economic and Sector Work (ESW),
in 2004 Bank officials participated in the conduct ofCountry Governance Profiles (CGPs) for Benin,
Cameroon, Chad, Kenya, Malawi, Mauritania, Senegal,
and Swaziland. The CGP is a Bank diagnostic tool to
identify key structural and institutional weaknesses and
to enter into participatory dialogue with RMC governments. CGPs are used to assess risks to Bank funds
and inform dialogue on governance-based reforms
and capacity-building programs. In 2004 Bank officials participated in the conduct of CGPs for Benin,
Cameroon, Chad, Kenya, Malawi, Mauritania, Senegal,
and Swaziland.

Collaboration on Governance Issues

he Bank collaborates with the World Bank in carrying out Country Financial Accountability Assessments
(CFAAs) to assess and analyze the degree to which
RMC financial management practices comply with
internationally accepted standards. CFAAs are also used
‘0 recommend corrective actions where shortfalls are
ound. In 2004 the Bank undertook joint CFAAs with
he World Bank in Chad and Uganda.

n May 2004 the Bank collaborated with the Center for
Corporate Governance in Africa to provide a residential
raining program on Corporate Governance for Board
members and Chief Executives of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in 15 RMCs from Eastern and Southern
Africa. A similar training program for SOE leaders from
1 francophone RMCs was held in Dakar, Senegal,
in October 2004. During the year the Bank also coninued to support the Public Sector Committee (PSC)
of the International Federation of Accountants. Bank
comments were integrated into the new standard on
Accounting for Development and Human Assistance.
Once implemented, the provisions of this standard are
expected to enhance transparency of financial reporting
by governmental agencies.

 

During the year the Bank co-organized with the ECA
and the AU the Fourth African Development Forum,
which took place in Addis Ababa on October 11-15,
2004. The Bank had earlier cosponsored the ECA's Africa
Governance Project, the outcome of which was presented at the Forum as the Africa Governance Report. The
Forum brought together over 1,000 participants from
the public, private, and civil society sectors, including
key representatives of governments and regional and
international organizations. It is also liaising with other
donors in devising a common approach to assist audit
institutions in Africa at national and regional levels.

 

Work is also ongoing on the drafting of a Bank Strategy
to support Supreme Audit Institutions.

Also in October 2004, the Bank participated in the
meeting organized by the Kenyan Government and the
Transparency International on “New Anti-Corruption
Governments: The Challenge of Delivery”. There was
high-level representation from the 27 participating
countries, including representatives of the donor community and the World Bank. The Bank also chairs
the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Terrorist
Financing (AML/CT) Working Group, in collaboration
with the US Treasury Department and continues to be
active in the Working Group on Anti-money Laundering
Initiatives in Africa.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

The mainstreaming of environmental sustainability concerns in the Bank's operations continued throughout
2004. In January the Boards approved the new Bank
Group Policy on the Environment, which incorporates
and redefines the former policy on environmentally sustainable development in Africa. The new policy acknowledges that to sustain economic growth in Africa, there is
an urgent need to preserve and enhance the ecological
capital that enriches such growth. The main goals of the
new policy are to:

e Promote a long-term view and perspective of economic and social development;

e Reverse where possible and halt the impoverishment
process in Africa by enhancing the access of the poor
to environmental resources;

¢ Help RMCs to build their human capacity and sensitize policymakers on environmental issues and bring
about institutional changes to achieve sustainable
development; and

¢ Reinforce the existing partnerships with international
institutions and network also with regional and subregional organizations to coordinate interventions in
environmental sustainable development.

Two guidelines relevant to the new Policy on the
Environment were completed and disseminated in 2004,
namely the Strategic Impact Assessment Guidelines
(SIA) and the Integrated Environmental and Social
Assessment Guidelines (IESA). The SIA is a systematic
process of evaluating the environmental consequences

(sOOperational Priorities and Effectiveness

of any proposed policy or program. It is also a tool for
assessing social and environmental sustainability of
policy-based lending, structural adjustment, and sector
investment lending. The /ESA Guidelines, on the other
hand, are designed to ensure that both environmental
and social issues are mainstreamed in Bank projects
throughout the project cycle.

In 2004 the Bank developed a 3-year Implementation
Plan (2005-2007) to execute its new Policy on the
Environment. The Plan seeks to ensure that a strong
and diversified economy will continue to take account
of environmental protection, and to guarantee that all
developmental decision-making integrates economic,
social, and environmental considerations. In addition,
the Plan aims to ensure that environmental management tools, like environmental reactive and proactive
assessments, will be used systematically to monitor
environmental performance and encourage community
involvement.

In September 2004 the Bank organized a seminar to
sensitize its staff in the area of renewable energy and
energy efficiency projects. Furthermore, a workshop
was organized for staff and officials of RMCs in the area
of wind energy on October 28-29, 2004. In pursuit of
this program, Bank staff are currently working with 5
experts from different regions of the continent in assessing the current situation vis-a-vis renewable energy in
Africa so as to assess capacity-building needs at the
country level and identify higher impact and visible
alternative projects. It is expected that the findings of
this team will be discussed during a regional consultative workshop planned for February 2005. To enhance
its operations in renewable energy projects, the Bank is
now revising its 1994 Energy Sector Policy with the aim
of incorporating into it a Renewable Energy and Energy
Efficiency Strategy.

GENDER MAINSTREAMING ACTIVITIES

Over the last few years considerable progress has been
made in mainstreaming gender in Bank Group activities.
Recent Bank policies in the areas of education, health,
water resources, agriculture and rural development, and
governance, inter alia, take account of gender concerns.
In 2004 the new Bank Group Gender Plan of Action
(GPOA) was finalized. The Plan builds on the Bank's 2001
Gender Policy and seeks to mainstream gender issues

96 DP ANNUAL REPORT 2004

ee

across a wide range of Bank projects, with the objective of harmonizing Bank priorities with those adopted
by RMCs in the Dakar and Beijing Platforms of Action.
During the recent ADF-X consultations, it was highlighted
that greater focus will be given to defining the scope of
gender activities, enhancing the development effectiveness of operations, strengthening the gender competence of Bank staff and RMC officials, and enhancing
collaboration and coordination with other development
partners on gender issues.

The formulation of operational Guidelines on Gender
Equity continued during 2004, with staff training within
the Bank and in the field planned for 2005. The Bank’s
sectoral guidelines lay out strategies to be adopted for
gender issues across the various stages of the project
cycle, including the need to collect gender disaggregated
data for project appraisal and evaluation.

Multisector Country Gender Profiles (MCGPs) were formulated in 2004 for Mozambique, Tanzania, and Uganda.
These MCGPs will provide scope for the Bank and the
borrowing country to participate in a collaborative process to analyze the gender dimensions of development
and identify gender-responsive policies, programs, and
actions to foster economic growth, human welfare, and
development effectiveness.

The Bank's first Symposium on Gender, organized jointly
by the African Development Bank Group and the ECA,
was held in Kampala, Uganda, in May 2004 in conjunction with the Bank’s Annual Meeting, taking as its theme
“Closing the Gender Gap: Promoting Gender Equity
for Growth and Development in Africa.” The key messages to emerge from the Symposium were the need to:
enhance the empowerment of women through education, including the specification of quotas in favor of girls;
improve data collection and analysis methods in order to
promote a better understanding of the linkages between
gender, growth, and development; promote male education and sensitization in the fight against HIV/AIDS while
addressing gender-based violence; and position women
in strategic positions of responsibility.

 

 

Progress in Mainstreaming Gender in Bank
Group Operations

Several ongoing projects aim to enhance the level of
women's participation, increase their access and control
over project resources, promote their involvement in
decision-making bodies and processes, and improve thesustainability of the benefits. Some projects target key
institutions, which are mandated to spearhead gender
mainstreaming at the national level, and aim to strengthen their capacity to design and implement gender-sensitive policy and development planning interventions.

In the education subsector, the multinational African
Virtual University Project, which supports the African
Virtual University (AVU) in Nairobi and its Open, Distance
and eLearning (ODeL) centers at 10 African universities,
includes a comprehensive range of gender components.
The project's primary objective is to increase enrollment
of female students generally in non-traditional subjects
through scholarships awards. The Eritrea Education Sector
Development Program and the Zanzibar Alternative
Learning and Skills Development Project both focus on
encouraging girls to continue their education.

The Kenya Rural Health Project Ill and two other health
projects in the Indian Ocean (the Multinational Regional
Initiative for HIV/AIDS/STI Prevention in IOC Member
Countries and the Madagascar: Support for the Control
of Communicable Diseases) address the special vulnerability of women to HIV/AIDS infection, while the Zambia
Child Welfare Project aims to increase the welfare of poor
families, many of whom care for AIDS orphans. The Social
Protection Projects in Tanzania and Uganda and the 2
projects currently being implemented in Egypt (the Social
Fund Project and the Women’s Empowerment in the New
Lands) offer microcredit and demand-driven skills and
business and literacy training, together with support to
integrated healthcare, as does the Madagascar Reduction
of Poverty of Women Project, which also targets savings
societies and health concerns.

The District Agriculture Sector Investment Project in
Tanzania seeks to ensure gender-responsive and equitable participation for development planning and implementation and the participation of women and other
disadvantaged groups in project implementation and
community representation and decision-making. Similarly,
the Farm Income Enhancement and Forest Conservation
Project currently being implemented in Uganda is being
designed specifically to address the needs of women,
as they themselves perceive and identify those needs.
Community members and beneficiaries of each site will
be exposed to a social and gender training package.

The objectives of the Institutional Support Project for the
Women's Affairs Office in Ethiopia are to build capacity at

 

various levels for addressing and monitoring progress in
achieving gender equity and related MDGs at the national and federal administration level. Similarly, the Djibouti
Women’s Support Project aims to build the capacity of
he Ministry of Gender and the NGO sector to support
gender equity. In addition, the Capacity Building for
Poverty Reduction Project in Sudan has a specific gender
component, which aims to support the governments in
oth North and South Sudan to formulate and implement Gender Policies and Action Plans and to conduct
aseline surveys on gender.

During the year under review, the Bank also financed a
study on Poverty, Gender and Social Exclusion in Mauritius.
The study was designed to inform the Government on
appropriate interventions in the area of social protection.
n the same vein, the recommendations of the study on
Education for Nomads in Eastern Africa sought to address
he needs of all nomadic children generally and the special needs of girls in particular.

During 2004, the Bank's Private Sector Department
published a study under its African Women in Business
Initiative. The study assesses the constraints and condiions for creating an enabling environment and promoting women entrepreneurial development in Africa. In tandem with this study, the Bank carried out, in collaboration
with the ILO, an assessment of women entrepreneurs in
Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. Based on the conclusions
of the study and the initial findings of the ADB/ILO country assessments, a Plan of Action has been developed to,
among other things, raise awareness among stakeholders and mobilize key players in the field of women and
entrepreneurship promotion, reinforce business capacity
building and networking among businesswomen associations, and promote financial and technical support for
the development of women entrepreneurs in Africa.

Regional Socioeconomic Trends and Bank Group OperationsIntroduction

This chapter addresses socioeconomic developments and
Bank Group operations in regional member countries
(RMCs) in 2004, set within the wider framework of the
changing global economic environment. The discussion
highlights the major dimensions of macroeconomic performance - economic growth, fiscal balance, inflation,
export earnings, current account balance, and foreign
capital inflows - for each of the Bank Group's 5 operational regions: Central, East, North, Southern, and West
Africa. The analysis focuses on major recent macroeconomic trends and reforms, privatization, social indicators,
and regional economic integration and cooperation
issues. The discussion of Bank Group operations examines the historical trends for operations in each region,
their cumulative performance, and approvals made in
2004. The conclusion summarizes the trends and the
short- to medium-term prospects.

THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONTEXT

Global Economic Upswing

The year 2004 witnessed a strong global expansion
and higher demand for commodities, marking a second
year of fairly robust global economic performance. As a
result, global growth rebounded to 5.1 percent in 2004
from 3.9 percent in 2003, the highest level for nearly
30 years. The improved performance was widespread
and well balanced - with strong growth in advanced
countries and exceptionally rapid expansion in emerging
countries, especially China and India. The other reasons
for this global economic upswing include a strong upturn
in industrial production and global trade flows, improved
labor market conditions, and continued strengthening
of investment. A further positive factor was the relative
improvement in domestic macroeconomic management
and reforms. Improved macroeconomic stability in 2004
boosted private sector confidence and investment in
many developing countries and transition economies,
thereby accelerating growth.

However, there were a number of unanticipated economic shocks, including the increase in world oil prices,
changes in exchange rates among major currencies, and
increased prices of many non-fuel commodities. The
largest of these economic shocks was the increase in oil
prices by almost 60 percent in the first 10 months, before
easing toward the end of the year. The second was the

 

continuous appreciation of the Euro and Yen against the
US Dollar. These economic shocks had counterbalancing
effects for most countries, but the overall net effect on
the global economy was beneficial. Furthermore, besides
the tsunami disaster in Asia, which occured at the tail end
of the year, and isolated threats to economic stability in
certain parts of the world, 2004 was largely characterized by fewer geopolitical tensions and uncertainties
compared to 2003. The United States continued to be
the main driver of economic growth in the advanced
economies, attaining a growth rate of 4.1 percent in
2004, up from 2.9 percent in 2003.

In Japan, the world’s second largest economy, economic
recovery accelerated in the first half of 2004 before
gradually subsiding, leading to overall growth of 3.6 percent in 2004 from 2.7 percent in 2003. The Euro Zone
still appears to be the weakest link in the global upturn,
although there was a continuation of recovery to 1.9
percent from 0.5 percent in 2003, fueled by expansion
in exports and fixed investments. In Europe as a whole,
consumer spending has remained lackluster in spite
of a modest growth rate of 2.3 percent during 2004.
Developing countries as a group witnessed a significant
increase in their growth rates in 2004, up from 4.6 percent in 2003 to 6.2 percent. East Asia continues to be
the principal driving force in the developing world, with
its growth rate rising from 6.0 percent in 2003 to 7.2
percent in 2004. China’s growth (at 9.2 percent) continued to play a key role in the performance of the region,
supported by India’s 6.8 percent growth rate.

In Africa real GDP growth rate reached an average of 5.1
percent in 2004, up from 4.4 percent in 2003. However,
this is still well below the 7 percent considered necessary
to meet the principal MDG target of halving the number
of people living in extreme poverty (i.e. on less than US$
1 a day) by 2015. More significantly, the growth rate
in 2004 is the highest recorded for the continent since
1996, and well above the average of 3.7 percent for the
previous 5 years.

Africa's impressive economic performance in 2004 is
attributable to the continent's improved macroeconomic
policies, high oil and non-fuel commodity prices, the
expansionary effects of global economic recovery, and
debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. Other
positive factors affecting growth in Africa during the
year included better weather conditions and post-conflict dividends in a number of countries. In spite of this

ANNUAL REPORT 2004102

Economic and Social Trends

historic growth performance, Africa continues to face
major challenges, including conflicts in some regions, a
high incidence of poverty, and the relentless surge of the
HIV/AIDS pandemic.

Globally, the rate of inflation registered a slight increase
during the year. In the advanced countries it rose from
1.8 percent in 2003 to 2.0 percent in 2004, while in the
developing countries it increased from 5.8 percent to 6.0
ercent during the same period. The inflation statistics
or the developing countries, however, mask considerable
regional variations. The average rate of inflation declined
0 single digits in Africa from 10.0 percent in 2003 to 7.7
ercent in 2004, and for the Western Hemisphere from
10.6 percent in 2003 to 6.6 percent in 2004. The most
significant aspect, however, is that global inflationary
ressures remained low during the year 2004.

Improved Global Trade

he volume of global merchandise trade accelerated from
5.5 percent in 2003 to 10.5 percent in 2004, reflecting
he rebound in global economic recovery and demand
conditions. Much of the trade growth in 2004 originated
in developed countries, particularly North America and
japan; this is in contrast to 2003, when growth was
driven by the developing economies, particularly China
and India. During 2004 both merchandise exports and
imports of developed countries increased significantly
‘0 8.6 percent and 9.0 percent respectively, from 2.9
ercent and 4.4 percent in 2003. Although merchandise
exports in the developing countries also increased from
10.5 percent in 2003 to 13.8 percent in 2004, merchandise imports accelerated at an even greater rate, from
10.5 percent in 2003 to 16.5 percent in 2004.

 

Africa's external trade performance in 2004 mirrored that
of developing countries as a whole. While the average
growth of merchandise exports from Africa decelerated
from 7.2 percent in 2003 to 4.6 percent in 2004, that
of merchandise imports accelerated from 5.8 percent to
7.2 percent over the same period. The growth in Africa's
imports is a reflection of the relative improvement in
its terms of trade, which stood at 6.7 percent in 2004,
compared to 3.8 percent in 2003. In many oil-exporting countries, increased investment to boost productive
capacities and infrastructure development constituted
the main driving force behind import growth. The high
prices for key commodities encouraged transnational
corporations (TNCs) to pursue new exploration projects in

ANNUAL REPORT 2004

ee

African countries, and a large part of the increase in FDI
came from investment in natural resources exploitation.

During 2004 oil and many non-oil commodity prices
rose strongly as a result of increased global demand. Oil
prices, though volatile, in 2004 averaged US$ 38.3/bbl,
a rise of nearly 60 percent from the 2001 level of US$
24.4/bbl. The oil price hike is due more to rising global
demand than to supply-side factors, although supply
constraints in some major oil producers were a further
contributory factor. International prices for most of the
non-oil commodities rose also in 2004 relative to 2003,
except for cocoa, robusta coffee, and groundnut oil,
which registered a drop in price during the year, owing
largely to increases in world production. There was a
significant increase in the price of metals and minerals in
2004 over the 2003 level.

Key Global Policy Developments Affecting
Africa in 2004

A number of key global policy developments affected
the continent in 2004. In the area of trade, progress
was made in the WTO July 2004 Framework, which sets
out modalities for the elimination of protectionist measures. The July Framework by itself does not translate
into tariff cuts or reduction/elimination of subsidies, nor
does it denote the end of the Doha Round. Nonetheless,
by setting out agreed modalities for multilateral trade
negotiations on the key trade issues, it has succeeded in
moving forward negotiations on the Doha Work Program
(DWP), which was stalled by the failure of the Cancun
negotiations in 2003. Two aspects of the July Framework
are worth mentioning: These are issues relating to trade
facilitation and cotton subsidies in the USA, which were
raised by African cotton producers.

Progress was also made in other areas, namely, the
African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) initiative
of the United States and the Everything But Arms (EBA)
initiative of the European Union. The AGOA, announced
in 2000, provides for duty-free access to US markets for
products originating from African countries; by year-end
2004, 38 African countries had qualified for preferential
treatment under this initiative. The EBA initiative, introduced in 2001, allows tariff-free, quota-free access to
imports from the least developed countries (LDCs) into
the EU; currently, 34 African countries benefit from this
initiative.Economic and Social Trends

growth rates of between 3 and 5 percent. It is also
notable that only 3 countries witnessed negative growth
rates, compared with 6 in the preceding year.

In the continent as a whole, the terms of trade improved
significantly to 6.7 percent in 2004. This increase is
partly accounted for by the rise in oil prices and the further
strengthening of the prices of major non-fuel commodities. In addition, the rebound in the global economy along
with strong demand from Asia for the region's primary
export commodities also boosted the continent's exports.
Africa's exports grew by 18.6 percent in value terms and
by 4.6 percent in volume terms. As a result, the continent's
current account improved significantly in 2004, recording
a surplus of over US$ 5 billion, despite an import growth
of 7.2 percent. In addition, improved export performance
and debt relief measures have contributed to a continuing
decline in the debt-service ratio for the continent, which
reached 11.8 percent in 2004, the lowest for 20 years.
Similarly, Africa's total debt in relation to its GDP continued
its decline, from a high of 76 percent in 1994, and 60.4
percent in 1999, to 43.2 percent in 2004 (see Figure 5.3).

The most recent UNCTAD data on foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to Africa indicate that although these
were quite low in 2003, compared to other developing
countries, they increased to 2.7 percent of global FDI
inflows, up from 1.7 percent in 2002. The upturn, from
US$ 19.9 billion in 2002 to US$ 24.3 billion in 2003,
occured against the backdrop of a global economy
recovery and an improved business environment in many
African countries.

In 2004 the average fiscal deficit for the continent stood at
zero percent of GDP, the lowest for over a decade, while
monetary growth, at 15.6 percent, was substantially lower
than the 18.5 percent historical average for the past 5
years. The improvement in the region's fiscal deficit and
tighter monetary policy contributed to its lowest average
inflation rate of 7.7 percent in over 2 decades.

Social Indicators

Africa's population grew by 2.2 percent in 2004, continuing its downward trend from 2.7 percent in 1990.
The average, however, masks considerable differences
among regions. The countries of North Africa, along
with a few others such as Mauritius and Seychelles, have
reduced both fertility and mortality rates and have consequently registered population growth rates of less than

(percentages)

0
1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 20042.0 percent. Other countries, mostly in Southern Africa,
that are heavily affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, have
seen mortality rates increase sharply and their population
growth rates decline steeply to an estimated 1.2 percent.
Estimates for the remaining regions range from 2.4 percent for East Africa to 2.6 percent for Central Africa, with
West Africa at the median of 2.5 percent.

African countries have lagged behind other developing
countries in such areas as life expectancy, school enrollment, and access to basic services. Life expectancy at
birth of 51 years is well below the developing countries’
average of 65 years, and the developed countries’ average of 78 years. The figure is declining further in several
countries due to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Infant mortality
is estimated at 79 per 1,000 live births, which is higher
than the developing countries’ average of 61 per 1,000
live births, and dramatically higher than the 5 per 1,000
live births for developed countries. The maternal mortality rate for Africa is estimated at 661 per 100,000 live
births; again this is far higher than 440 for developing
countries and 13 for the developed world.

cation) are below the developing countries’ averages of
107 percent and 59 percent, respectively. Only about 64
percent of the population has access to potable water,
compared with 79 percent availability in all developing
countries and 100 percent for the industrialized countries. Furthermore, the proportion of population in Africa
that has access to health services is only 67 percent, compared with 100 percent in the developed world.

Domestic Policy Developments

In 2004 the main thrust of most African countries’
domestic policy was macroeconomic stabilization, fiscal
consolidation, private sector participation, economic
diversification, trade promotion, and poverty reduction.
The promotion of foreign direct investment, trade liberalization, and strengthening of regional economic groupings were further areas of renewed attention.

Many African countries adopted a tight fiscal policy during the year toward controlling government expenditure.
Fiscal policy was also directed to revenue enhancement
schemes in some countries, leading to improved tax
collection. The tight monetary policy stance in Africa
witnessed in 2003 continued through 2004, leading to
a slowdown in broad money growth from 18.0 percent
in 2003 to 15.6 percent in 2004. This continental performance is also reflected in the monetary policy stance of a
number of countries, especially the larger ones.

Structural reforms in Africa have evolved in recent years.
Although public sector restructuring (including privatization)
continues to play a major part in the program of reforms,
African governments have also started to pursue more
active policies toward poverty alleviation and employment
creation (with a strong focus on infrastructure, education,
and health) and to push through regulatory reforms to create an enabling environment for the private sector.

Regional Development Policy

Africa's regional development policy is grounded in the
New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).
African Heads of State and Government have continued
to champion NEPAD both in Africa and on the international stage. Several African countries have established
national NEPAD Steering Committees with representation from civil society and business. The support for the
NEPAD initiative continued to grow during 2004. (On

to the preparation of integrated agricultural and rural
development plans.

An important development for NEPAD was the launching of the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) at
the Seventh Meeting of NEPAD Heads of State and
Government Implementation Committee (HSGIC) in May
2003. The APRM Forum held its inaugural meeting in
February 2004, when a 6-member Panel of Eminent
Persons was appointed to take charge of implementing
the mechanism. The APRM is seen as “a system of voluntary self-assessment and constructive peer dialogue and
persuasion,” and aims to ensure compliance by participating States to agree on political, economic, and corporate
governance values, codes, and standards. Twenty-three
member states of the African Union (AU) have signed
the APRM's Memorandum of Understanding to date. It
is hoped that the transparency of the process and its
results will encourage compliance with good governance
standards, especially on the part of the stakeholders in the
country. (See also Box 5.1.)

REGIONAL SOCIOECONOMIC TRENDS
AND BANK GROUP OPERATIONS

CENTRAL AFRICA

Recent Macroeconomic Trends and Reforms

The Central Africa region comprises 10 countries:
Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR),
Chad, Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Rwanda, and Sao Tomé and
Principe. The total population in Central Africa numbered
107.6 million in 2004, equivalent to 12.4 percent of the
continental total.

Although the region’s contribution to continental GDP
increased for the fourth consecutive year in 2004, to 5.8
percent, its share is still the lowest of all the 5 regions.
The growth in Central Africa’s GDP is due to enhanced
peace prospects in the Great Lakes region, and increased
oil exploration and developments in Equatorial Guinea
and Chad. The region was the best growth performer in
2004, with real GDP increasing by 14.4 percent, against a
continental average of 5.1 percent. Central Africa's GDP
per capita rose from US$ 375 in 2003 to US$ 442 in 2004
(see Table 5.2).

 

BOX 5.1
Reforming Public Sector Management in Africa

In Africa, the capacity of the public sector to manage and
guide the development process as well as create an enabling
environment for the private sector is often regarded as one of
the major challenges to economic growth. Since the 1980s,
several countries have undertaken structural reforms, some
of which have involved state structures and public sector
management systems. There have been marked improvements in terms of efficiency, although some problems, such
as corruption and rent seeking, have proved hard to eradicate
entirely from political and state institutions. Public accountability, administrative and public policy-making capacities have
remained weak, while deficiencies still exist in terms of the
capacity and efficiency of fiscal, budgetary, and expenditure
monitoring systems.

In our era of globalization, the state systems need to be made
more effective to cope with challenges of not only securing the
common peace, but also maintaining macroeconomic stability
to enhance both domestic and international competitiveness.
In the African context, this requires the strengthening of public

 

administration systems, adopting and practicing participative
governance, adherence to openness and adaptability, and equitably developing social capital. It also entails adopting flexible
approaches and methods of administration, and strengthening
the voice of African governments in international bodies.

Lessons of recent experience show that for reforms to be
successful, they need to be not only homegrown and demanddriven, but also internally consistent and coordinated on the
national policy level. The Asian model of the developmental
state points to certain vital ingredients for successful public
management: a reliable and effective judiciary, including institutionalization and enforcement of property rights; existence
of the rule of law; a merit-based and highly professionalized
civil service based on competitive entry and promotion; and
competent core economic agencies for planning and management. Leadership at the highest levels is critical, including
political commitment and a willingness to risk political capital
in the interest of growth.Economic and Social Trends

15 Social Indicators

The social indicators for the Central Africa region are se
out in Table 5.3. The Human Poverty Index (HPI) in the
region averaged about 43 percent, which is above the

health services and sanitation in the region is 64 percent
and 37 percent, which is lower than Africa’s average of
67 percent and 42 percent respectively. The statistics for
both the daily supply of calories (DSC) and daily protein
supply (DPS) reveal the existence of a general deficiency
in nutritional status when compared to the previous 2
decades.

In terms of school enrollment, there is an educational
deficiency at both the primary and secondary school levels, particularly for girls. Gross primary school enrollment
of males and females at the regional level is 96 percent
and 83 percent, respectively. This marks, however, an
improvement over the 1980 levels for male/female
enrollment of 94 percent and 69 percent respectively. At
the secondary school level, the enrollment statistics are
even more disappointing at 37/24 percent (male/female),
which is well below the continental levels of 42/41 (male/
female). No country in the region has achieved a secondary male/female enrollment ratio above the continental
average.

Furthermore, it is clear that the limited access of the
population to both health services and sanitation poses
serious implications for related indices like life expectancy,
infant mortality, and maternal mortality in the region.

Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation
The Central African region has 3 regional integration
structures, namely the Economic Community of Central
African States (ECCAS), the Central African Monetary
and Economic Community of Countries (CEMAC), and
the dormant Economic Community of Countries of the
Great Lakes (CEPGL). During the year 2004, ECCAS
and its Council for Peace and Security in Central Africa
(COPAX) continued to work very closely with the UN
Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions
in Central Africa. In December 2004, ECCAS decided
to create a 2,400-strong regional military command to
promote the prevention, resolution, and management of
conflicts within the region.

The regional organization renewed its commitment to
the implementation of the New Partnership for Africa's
Development (NEPAD) at its summit in Brazzaville (Congo)
in January 2004, when ECCAS Heads of State agreed to
set up a Free Trade Zone and a Common Agricultural Policy
by 2008. In the CEMAC region, the action group against
money laundering (GABAC) was inaugurated in March
2004, but plans to introduce T-bills in the region in January
2005 were postponed. Discussions are ongoing among
member countries to create a regional stock market, set
up a CEMAC Development Fund, establish a CEMAC passport, and launch Air CEMAC in the near future.Central Africa: Cumulative Bank Group Loan and

(17.7 percent), and transportation (6.8 percent).

EAST AFRICA

Recent Macroeconomic Trends

The East Africa region is made up of 11 countries:
Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar,
Mauritius, Seychelles, Somalia, Tanzania, and Uganda.
The region registered a combined population of 204.5
million in 2004, representing approximately 23.6 percent
of the continent's population.

After 2 years of subdued economic activity, mostly resulting from the severe drought that hit the Horn of Africa in
2002, East Africa recorded a remarkable economic recovery
in 2004 with a real GDP growth rate of 6.8 percent. This is
far above the average of 2.3 percent achieved in 2003. East
Africa was the second highest regional economic performer
on the continent in 2004 after Central Africa.

The region's GDP per capita remains the lowest in Africa,
averaging US$ 276 in 2004. East Africa's GDP accounted
for 7.1 percent of total Africa's GDP in 2004, making it
the second lowest contributor to the continent's wealth
after Central Africa.

After 4 years of consecutive marginal increases, average
inflation in East Africa declined from 6.4 percent in 2003
to 5.0 percent in 2004 (see Table 5.5 and Figure 5.6),
partly as a result of improved food supply conditions and
an improvement in the conduct of monetary and fiscal
policy in the region.

The average fiscal deficit declined to 3.0 percent of GDP
in 2004, from 3.9 percent in 2003, reflecting continued
efforts by most governments in the region to enhance
revenue and tighten expenditure control. The region's fis

cal deficit nonetheless remained high compared with the
continental average of zero percent in 2004.

The region's domestic investment rate rose to 19.5
percent in 2004, up from 17.9 percent in 2003. This
remained close to the continental average of 20.1 percent. Gross national savings as a percentage of the GDP
decreased, from 15.2 percent in 2003 to 14.7 percent in
2004. Savings shortage and strong aid dependency are
very serious problems in some of East Africa's countries.
East Africa’s current account deficit increased to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2004, compared with a small continental
surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP.

On the other hand, the external debt burden continued to
decline in 2004 as a result of cautious borrowing policies
of many governments and debt relief. However, the total
external debt overhang averaged 55.9 percent of GDP in
2004, which is much higher than the continental average
of 43.2 percent of GDP.

Social Indicators

Using the available statistics of percentage of population
living below the international extreme poverty threshold of
US$ 1 per day, 3 countries of the region stand out with high
concentrations of poverty. The Human Development Index
(HDI) for East Africa is generally low at 0.424, as against
0.485 for the continent. Average life expectancy in the
region, which stands at 47 years, is much lower than the
continental average of 51 years. Life expectancy for most
countries of the region has actually declined since 1970.

Further, infant mortality rate (IMR) for the region is high at
an average 90 deaths per 1,000 live births, while that of the
continent averaged 79 per 1,000 live births. The maternal
mortality rate (MMR) is also very high.TABLE 5.6

The region's nutritional status remains a challenging concern, for while the daily calorie supply per capita (DCS) for
the continent is 2,379, it stands at 1,962 for East Africa.
Both these figures, however, fall below the World Heath
Organization (WHO) benchmark of 2,500 DCS (see Table
5.6). The average proportion of the population in the
region with access to health services and sanitation is only
54 percent and 27 percent, compared to the continent's
average of 67 percent and 42 percent respectively. Gross
primary school enrollment ratio in the region of 89/79
(males/females), compared fairly favorably to the continental average of 99/84 percent respectively.

With respect to secondary education, enrollment was generally low in 2004, although there has been a significant
improvement over the last 10 years. Africa's continental
average stood at 42/41 percent (males/females), while
the East Africa regional average was 22/20 percent. Adult
illiteracy rates in the region remain high at 28/43 percent
(males/females), although this represents a 10-year decrease
from 49 percent for males and 73 percent for females.
Considerable progress therefore seems to have been made
in reducing adult illiteracy of both males and females in the
region. However, for the majority of countries in the region,
poverty and low human development as well as the AIDS/
HIV pandemic, and low female school enrollment represent
serious challenges for their development.

Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation
The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA), the East Africa Community (EAC), and the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) are
the major regional integration organizations in East Africa.
A number of major developments took place in the region
in 2004.

COMESA had planned to launch a Customs Union in
December 2004 but this was postponed in June 2004 to
allow more time for impact assessment studies to be completed and regional consultations to take place. During the
year, Swaziland, which is also a member of the Southern
African Customs Union (SACU), was given a year to join the
COMESA Free Trade Area (FTA). Comoros was accepted as
a member of FTA in December 2004, bringing the number
of COMESA countries in the FTA to 12.

The EAC Customs Union was formally launched in January
2004. The Protocol on the establishment of the EAC
Customs Union was signed in March 2004 and the 3 member countries - Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania — ratified it in
December 2004. The EAC Customs Union aims to: liberalize intraregional trade; promote efficiency in production;
enhance domestic, regional and foreign investment; as well
as promote economic development, diversification, and
industrialization.

NORTH AFRICA

Recent Macroeconomic Trends

North Africa, which comprises 7 countries - Algeria, Egypt,
Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan, and Tunisia - is the
largest contributor to the continent's wealth, accounting
for 36.4 percent of its GDP in 2004. The region is home to
some 190 million people, representing around 22 percent of

2003 and persisted through 2004, is largely due to a robust
export performance in the region's oil-producing countries.
The region’s average per capita GDP income was US$ 1,521
in 2004, which is about twice the continental average.
Except for Mauritania and Sudan, all countries in the region
are classified as middle-income countries (MICs).

Inflation in North Africa has remained relatively stable during
the last 3 years, averaging about 2.7 percent in 2004 —a sig

nificant decrease from 3.7 percent in 2003. This is no doubt
far better than the continent's average of 7.7 percent. The
fiscal position in North Africa is relatively healthy compared
with the rest of the continent. The regional fiscal balance
registered a modest surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2004,
against the continental average of zero percent of GDP.

The region has a high national savings averaging 25.7 percent of GDP during the last 4 years. This could be explained
by strong inflows of foreign exchange earnings from the oil
sector and slow credit growth in the private sector. Gross
domestic investment in the region rose to 21.7 percent of
GDP in 2004, marginally up from 21.6 percent in 2003,
while gross national savings increased to 27.6 percent of
GDP, which was well above the continental average of 19.8
percent (see Table 5.8).

North Africa's external position was strengthened in 2004,
in the face of rising oil prices and improved external
competitiveness. The current account balance, which had
consistently been in surplus for 4 consecutive years (20002003), rose to 5.9 percent of GDP in 2004, up from 5.1
percent in 2003.

The region's external debt burden is the second lowest in
the continent after Southern Africa. The total debt stock
of North Africa stood at an equivalent of 40.9 percent of
its GDP in 2004, which is a significant decline over 45.0
percent for 2003. The region has consistently experienced
a declining debt service ratio since 2000 except for 2002.
The ratio is 12.0 percent in 2004, down from 13.9 percent
in 2003.

nent. Available data on population living under the US$ 1 a
day extreme poverty threshold show that this ranges from
1.8 percent to 3.1 percent of the population. The regional
HPI at 29 percent is below Africa's average of 39 percent,
but its HDI of 0.636 is above Africa's average of 0.485.

The region's average life expectancy is 67 years, which is
well above the continental average. The infant mortality in
the region, which averages 45 per 1,000 live births, is much
below the continental average (see Table 5.9). Maternal
mortality in the region is the lowest in the continent at 233
deaths per 100,000 live births.

The nutritional status of the region is fairly good. The
regional average for daily calorie supply per capita (DCS) is
2,967 which is not only much higher than the continental
average (2,379 DCS) but surpasses the WHO minimum
daily requirement (of 2,500 DCS). Correspondingly, the daily
protein supply per capita (DPS) is high, averaging 85 DPS.
The population with access to health services and sanitation
in the region averaged 88 percent and 64 percent. This is
much higher than the continental average of 67 percent
and 42 percent respectively.

Gross enrollment ratio for primary schooling in the region
is 99/91 percent (males/-females). The region’s male enrollment is at par with Africa's continental level of 99 percent,
but the enrollment ratio for female students surpasses the
continental average of 84 percent. At the secondary school
level, enrollment records are not as robust, but most coun

The adult illiteracy rate for the region (28 percent) is basically
the same as the continental average for males, although
the female ratio at 49 percent is higher than the continental
average of 44 percent (see Table 5.9). Adult illiteracy in the
region is therefore a challenging issue to be addressed.

Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation
In North Africa, the major economic grouping is the Arab
Maghreb Union (AMU). During an extraordinary meeting of
the AMU Council of Foreign Ministers convened in Tripoli in
December 2004, the position of Libya as Chairman of the
organization was ratified for the third consecutive year. In
May 2004, 4 new countries - Céte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Liberia,
and Guinea-Bissau - joined CENSAD, bringing its total
membership to 22 states.

In February 2004 a crucial step was taken under the
EU-Mediterranean Partnership (also called the Barcelona
Process), when Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco signed
a Free Trade Agreement. The EU has agreed to support this
initiative with a € 4 million grant.

Bank Group Operations

Four of the North African countries - Algeria, Egypt,
Morocco, and Tunisia - are ADB-window eligible because
of their relatively high-income status. Mauritania is ADF-eligible. Libya is not a borrowing RMC, while Sudan has been
under sanctions since 1995 because of its default in the
payment of its arrears.

The Bank started operations in North Africa in 1968, a year
later than in other regions. Between 1967 and 2004, North
Africa was the biggest recipient of cumulative Bank Group
approvals, attracting UA 11.4 billion or 32.5 percent of total
loan and grant approvals. Sectoral priorities in this region
varied from the other regions of the continent, with most
of the Bank Group's allocations in North Africa going to
support financial sector reforms and private sector development. The cumulative loan and grant distribution according
to sectors for the period 1967-2004 was as follows: finance

(13.9 percent), transportation (13.6 percent), agriculture
(12.8 percent), social sectors (6.7 percent), water supply
and sanitation (5.3 percent), industry (4.3 percent), and
communication (2.6 percent) (see Figure 5.9).

In 2004 loan and grant approvals to the region totaled UA
516.5 million. This represents a sharp increase from UA
398.5 million in 2003. The funds were allocated to the following sectors: transportation (67.4 percent), multisector
(20.3 percent), water supply and sanitation (10.9 percent),
agriculture (1.3 percent), and social sector (0.1 percent).
With a combination of project loans and lines of credit,
most of the region's Bank approvals in 2004 were directed
towards water supply, electricity, railway, housing, and
road rehabilitation. A humanitarian emergency grant was
approved for Morocco.

SOUTHERN AFRICA

Recent Macroeconomic Trends

Ten countries make up the Southern African region - Angola,
Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South
Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The region is
dominated by South Africa, which accounts for 24.4 percent of the continental GDP. The population in Southern
Africa totaled 121.4 million in 2004, or 14.0 percent of the
continental total.

The region's real GDP growth rate rose from 2.6 percent in
2003 to 4.0 percent in 2004. This was 1.1 percent below
the continental average. The higher rate of regional growth
mostly reflected improved performance in South Africa. The
critical food situation, which was the result of drought and
the spread of HIV/AIDS, continued to take its toll on most of

the countries. Higher economic performance by most of the
countries in the group led to a rise in the region's per capita
income from US$ 1,773 in 2003 to US$ 2,232 in 2004.

Southern Africa has consistently recorded inflation rates
well above the continental average. Inflation in this region,
hough still very high, declined from an average of 36.0
percent in 2003 to 26.4 percent in 2004. This is well over 3
imes the continental average of 7.7 percent. South Africa,
he economic powerhouse of the region, has experienced
a stable inflation rate of 2.6 percent due to tight monetary
policy and fiscal discipline. The relatively high inflation levels in Southern Africa are due to raised inflation levels in
Zimbabwe, Angola, and Zambia.

The region's fiscal deficit increased from 2.8 percent in 2003
(0 3.2 percent in 2004. The gross domestic investment/GDP
ratio inched up to 20.0 percent in 2004, indicating ongoing
investment projects in the region's mining, electricity, transportation, and telecommunications sectors. Gross national
savings meanwhile stood at 15.1 percent of GDP, which
remained low by continental standards.

There was a significant improvement in Southern Africa's
‘erms of trade during the year, rising from 2.2 percent in
2003 to 7.4 percent. This increase is to a large part a reflecion of the continuous rise in non-oil commodity prices
(including gold, diamonds, platinum and copper, and zinc
— and for Angola only, oil). Export performance was mixed
in the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) countries.
Southern Africa is also the least indebted region in the continent, with the region's external debt-to-GDP ratio averaging
29.8 percent in 2004, against a continental average of 43.2
percent.

Social Indicators

On the basis of international extreme poverty line of US$
1 a day, poverty in the region ranged from 11.5 percent
to 64 percent among the countries. The high level of
poverty therefore continues to pose a major challenge to
some countries in the region. The HPI averaged 42 percent
against the continental average of 39 percent. The regional
HDI averaged 0.508, which is higher than the continental
average of 0.485.

(...): data not available.

Life expectancy in the region is the lowest in the entire continent at 40 years against the African average of 51 years. No
country in the region registered a life expectancy level above
the continental average. The low and declining state of life
expectancy is attributed to the increase in the HIV/ AIDS
pandemic. Infant mortality remains high in Southern Africa,
averaging 82 deaths per 1,000 live births. Five countries
have infant mortality rates below the continental average
of 79 deaths per 1,000 live births (see Table 5.12). The
region has the second lowest average MMR (580 deaths per
100,000 live births), after North Africa.

Available data reveal that population with access to health
services and sanitation in the region averaged 48 percent
and 50 percent, compared to the continent's average of
67 percent and 42 percent respectively. Nutrition levels also
remain a development challenge, with an average DCS per
capita of 2,374, against the continental average of 2,379
and also below the World Heath Organization (WHO) daily
minimum requirement of 2,500 DCS. Also, the region's daily
protein supply per capita of only 58 grams is below Africa's
average of 61 grams.

 

 

The region recorded the highest enrollment ratios in the
continent, for both male and female at the primary school
level, averaging 109 percent for males and 102 percent for
females. At the secondary school level, the region registered
near-balanced gender school enrollment ratios of around

51/50 percent for males/females, although there exist significant disparities among the countries. Stepping up enrollment at all levels therefore constitutes a major task facing
these countries. Adult illiteracy rates in Southern Africa are
reasonably low, averaging 17 percent for males and 28
percent for females. These are all below the rates of all the
regions in the continent whose averages are 28 percent for
males and 44 percent for females, respectively.

Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation
Apart from COMESA, the Southern African countries also
belong to the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) and the Southern African Customs Union (SACU).
Madagascar applied to join SADC in August 2004, where
the Dar es Salaam Declaration on Agriculture and Food
Security and the Principles and Guidelines Governing
Democratic Elections in the Region were adopted.

Two major road maps were launched in 2004 - the SADC
Regional Indicative Strategic Plan (RISP) and the Strategic
Indicative Plan for the Organ (SIPO), which focuses on
strengthening political, defense, and security cooperation.
The SADC Business Forum was launched in February 2004,
regrouping regional business organizations in mining, agriculture, small and medium enterprises, railway, banking,
and trade. The mid-review of SADC Protocol on Trade took
place in February 2004, in preparation for a full-blown FTA
in 2008. The first SADC-EU economic partnership agree

ment (EPA) negotiation meeting took place in Brussels in
December 2004. In 2004, SACU continued to negotiate
new Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with its main trading
partners. After 3 years of negotiation, the new SACU
agreement came into force in July 2004. The agreement
seeks to democratize revenue-sharing and decision-making
within the community. A regional FTA between SACU and
South American bloc, Mercosur, was signed in December
2004. Also during the year, the Bank's Regional Assistance
Strategy Paper (RASP) for Southern Africa for the period
2004-2008 was finalized, the first region to benefit from
this initiative.

Bank Group Operations

The Bank Group started its operations in Southern Africa in
1969. Four countries (Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and
Swaziland) are ADB-window eligible, while the remaining 5
(Angola, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia) are
ADF-eligible. Zimbabwe is a blend country, eligible for funding from both the ADB and ADF windows.

Between 1969 and 2004, the region received cumulative
Bank Group loan and grant approvals of UA 4.84 billion
(see Table 5.13). This represents 13.8 percent of the cumulative loan and grant approvals to all RMCs. The cumulative approvals for the region supported the following key
sectors: transportation (17.9 percent), agriculture (16.1
percent), finance (15.0 percent), social (12.8 percent), multisector (11.3 percent), power supply (7.1 percent), water
supply and sanitation (7.0 percent), industry (6.9 percent),
and communications (5.9 percent) (see Figure 5.11).

In 2004 Bank Group loan and grant approvals to the region
stood at UA 267.0 million, which is slightly lower than the

percent), and social sector (5.1 percent). The emphasis on
financing reflects the Bank's expansion of private sector
operations in Southern Africa, where lines of credit were
distributed between infrastructure projects and financial
intermediaries.

WEST AFRICA

Recent Macroeconomic Trends

The West African region consists of 15 countries. Eight
countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Céte d'Ivoire, Guinea
Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) belong to the
CFA Zone, while the remaining 7 countries (Cape Verde,
Ghana, Guinea, The Gambia, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra
Leone) are outside the CFA Zone. Nigeria is the economic powerhouse of the region, accounting for some

55.4 percent of regional output. In 2004, the region's
GDP constituted 16.5 percent of the continent's total, a
contribution higher than that of Central and East Africa
combined.

West Africa's population totaled 247.6 million, or 31.2 per
cent of the continental total, in 2004. With a GDP per capita
of US$ 527, West Africa ranked far behind the North and
Southern regions in terms of living standards, but slightly
better than the Central and East African regions.

Growth in West Africa decelerated sharply from a peak of
7.0 percent in 2003 to 3.4 percent in 2004. This is 1.7 percent below the continental average. Inflation in West Africa
averaged 4.3 percent in 2004, down from 5.2 percent in
2003 as a result of tight monetary and fiscal policies. The
inflation in West Africa was therefore well below the continental average of 7.7 percent in 2004. The fiscal position
in the region improved in 2004, despite the impact of Cote
d'lvoire's crisis on the CFA Zone’s fiscal position. The fiscal
balance moved from a deficit of 2.0 percent in 2003 to a
surplus of 3.7 percent in 2004.

West Africa's external position improved in 2004, with the
current account deficit declining slightly to 5.2 percent of
GDP. against 5.6 percent in 2003. The region's terms of
trade improved from 6 percent in 2003 to 12 percent in
2004, but the growth in volume of export goods was only
1.2 percent (see Table 5.14). West Africa's debt burden
eased in 2004, with the debt GDP ratio declining to 54.4
percent, down from 63.3 percent in 2003. But the debt
service as a percentage of exports grew from 7.1 percent in

it compares favorably with the continent's debt service ratio
of 11.8 percent for 2004.

ANNUAL REPORT 2004Economic and Social Trends

Social Indicators

West Africa remains one of the poorest regions on the coninent. Based on the international extreme poverty indicator
of US$ 1 a day, the poverty incidence ranges from 12.3 percent to 88 percent within the countries of the region. West
Africa’s HP! averaged 40 percent, which is slightly higher
han the continental average of 39 percent. The average
ife expectancy, which stands at 50 years, is slightly below
he continental average (51 years). Infant mortality in the
region is high, registering 84 per 1,000 live births. Similarly,
he maternal mortality rate (MMR) at 843 per 100,000 live
births is higher than the continental average of 661 per
100,000 live births. Access to health services and sanitation
in the region remains a serious problem: an average of 66
percent and 37 percent of the people have access to health
services and sanitation as against 67 percent and 42 percent
or the continental average.

 

Nutrition in the region poses a formidable challenge,
although the regional average of 2,500 DCS is precisely the
WHO minimum daily requirement (see Table 5.15). The daily
protein supply per capita (DPS), on the other hand, was 59,
which is slightly below Africa's average of 61.

Primary school enrollment in the region averaged 95 percent
for males and 76 percent for females. These are below the

TABLE 5.15

continental ratios of 99/84 percent (males/females). At the
secondary school level, the enrollment rates for both males
and females averaged 28 and 19 percent, respectively. Both
are below Africa’s continental averages of 42/41 percent
(male/female). Adult illiteracy rates for both males and
females (33/50 percent) are above the continental averages
of 28 and 44 (males/females). These statistics demonstrate
clearly that the region is educationally disadvantaged in relation to the entire continent.

Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation
There are 3 regional integration organizations in West
Africa: the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), the West African Economic and Monetary
Union (WAEMU), and the Mano River Union (MRU). Main
developments in regional cooperation in 2004 are detailed
below. ECOWAS Heads of State met with World Bank
President James Wolfensohn in March 2004 to agree on
a short-term plan of action on the establishment of a free
trade area and customs union by the end of 2007. In July
2004, the ECOWAS Council of Ministers revived plans to
establish a Court of Justice and approved the launch of
the Intergovernmental Group against Money Laundering in
Africa (GIABA).

ECOWAS and WAEMU signed a cooperation agreement for

Bank Group Operations

Nigeria is the only blend RMC in the West African region
that can borrow from both the ADB and ADF windows. All
the remaining 14 countries are only ADF-eligible. Between
1967 and 2004, the region had cumulative Bank Group
loan and grant approvals of UA 8.31 billion, equivalent to
23.8 percent of the total cumulative allocations to Africa as
a whole. This made West Africa the second largest recipient
of Bank Group operations after North Africa. The cumulative loans and grants were distributed to the following key
sectors: agriculture (22.1 percent), social (16.8 percent),
transportation (14.1 percent), multisector (12.5 percent),
water supply and sanitation (10.6 percent), finance (8.8
percent), industry (7.9 percent), power supply (6 percent),
and other sectors (1.1 percent) (see Figure 5.13).

In 2004 Bank Group approvals to West Africa stood at
UA 133.9 million, which is substantially lower than the
UA 437.0 million approved in 2003 (see Table 5.16). In
accordance with the Bank Group's strategic framework,
loans and grants were distributed amongst the following

Economic and Social Trends

CONCLUSION

Africa's average real GDP growth in 2004 stood at 5.1
percent, the highest economic performance the continent
has witnessed since 1996. The recovery in the global
economic climate, coupled with higher oil and non-oil commodity prices and improved macroeconomic management,
accounted for Africa's growth performance. There is, however, considerable variation in economic performance across
African countries and regions. There were 20 countries that
recorded growth rates above 5 percent, while only 3 of the
remaining 33 countries experienced negative growth.

In terms of the short- and medium-term outlook, Africa’s
improved growth rate is expected to continue in 2005 but
at a slightly lower rate of about 4.7 percent. This projection is based on the premise that the global economy will
continue to expand, regional conflicts in Africa will subside,
while weather conditions and prices of oil and non-oil commodities as well as minerals will remain relatively favorable
to African countries.

There can be no doubt that Africa still faces enormous
challenges. At the Extraordinary Summit of AU Heads of
State in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in September 2004,
African leaders affirmed that reducing poverty and achieving the MDGs would continue to be a central focus of
their development efforts. To halve the number of people

ving in extreme poverty by 2015 would, however, require
more countries to continuously raise their growth rates
‘0 the level of 6-8 percent. Appropriate policies would be
needed to ensure that the anticipated higher growth rates
ranslated into improved livelihoods for the vast majority of
he poor. African countries also need to sustain the prudent
macroeconomic policies that they have begun to implement
and to deepen their reform programs, as these are critical
‘O improving the continent's growth and development
prospects.

IN particular, financial sector and governance reforms
— including legal and judicial reforms and systems to protect
property rights - are critical to creating a more favorable
climate for mobilizing domestic resources and attracting
oreign investment. In addition, in an era of globalization,
it is imperative that regional cooperation and integration
arrangements are also strengthened, particularly in the
context of the NEPAD initiative. African countries will need
‘0 take advantage of the improved external environment
‘0 push through vital reforms. The higher oil and non-oil
commodity prices have resulted in significant windfall earnings for many countries. These countries need to use such
earnings to finance critical reforms as to well as put aside a
large share of these windfalls to enable them to withstand
adverse terms of trade and external shocks that are likely to
occur in the future.PART III

The ADB window is the nonconcessional lending arm
of the Bank that supports development activities in its
creditworthy regional member countries (RMCs) and also
in blend countries, which are eligible for concessional
financing from the ADF window. The Bank mobilizes
funds from the international capital markets to finance
key reform projects and programs to improve the
competitiveness of the economies of the beneficiary
countries. Funds from the ADB window are also used
to finance private sector projects in all RMCs provided
they are financially viable. In addition, the Bank provides
emergency assistance from its Special Relief Fund (SRF) to
support RMCs emerging from situations of conflict and
those affected by unpredictable natural disasters.

During 2004, ADB operational activities increased to UA
1.52 billion from UA 745.8 million in 2003 and UA 1.07

Project aims to achieve broader access to social services in
the project area and to improve connectivity between the
Kunene Region and other parts of the country.

The third project loan was approved for Tunisia’s Road
Network Rehabilitation Project (Phase IV). The project
aims to cut transportation costs by improving the capacity of the classified road network and reducing constraints related to the width of paved roads. The fourth
loan was for Morocco’s Eighth Drinking Water Supply and
Sanitation Project. The aims of the project are (i) to ensure
a sustainable supply of drinking water to several towns
and cities, and the new tourist and port complexes; (ii) to
improve drinking water access and sanitary conditions in
rural areas that are not on the supply network; and (iii) to

With regard to policy-based lending, one sector adjustment loan amounting to UA 207.8 million was approved
for Morocco to support the transportation sector reform
program. The program objectives comprise: (i) liberalizing the transportation market and auxiliary activities;
(ii) upgrading the professional, structural, and organizational capacities of the operators in the sector; (iii) better
allocation of resources and institutional building of the
transportation administration; and (iv) strengthening of
transportation security and safety.

The 2 structural adjustment loans (SALs) amounting
to UA 181.0 million were approved for Gabon and
Morocco. The SAL for Gabon is to help the Government
implement its 2004-2005 Reform Program, which is
widely supported by the international community and
particularly by the IMF and the EU. The objective of the
program is to create the right conditions for generating
sustainable growth that could curb the high level of poverty in Gabon. The loan is also to help address the steady

Special Relief Fund for Emergency Operations
The Special Relief Fund (SRF) resources are used to
support emergency humanitarian relief operations in
countries affected by unpredictable natural disasters and
those emerging from post-conflict situations. In 2004
a total amount of UA 2.82 million was approved for
emergency operations in 4 countries and one multinational. The approvals to Djibouti, Kenya, and Madagascar
were to assist in the alleviation of the suffering of the
victims of flood, drought, and cyclones in these countries
respectively. The humanitarian emergency assistance to
Morocco was to support the February 2004 earthquake
victims. The multinational humanitarian emergency relief
was for the control of desert locust invasion in Northern
Africa, which was to be administered by the FAO.

Private Sector Operations

The Bank recognizes the contribution of the private sector
in facilitating broad-based economic growth leading to
poverty reduction in RMCs. In this regard, the ADB continues to increase its support for private sector activities with
the emphasis on the financial sector, infrastructure, and
small and medium-scale enterprise (SME) development.

In 2004 the Bank approved 4 private sector loans amounting to a total of UA 161.2 million representing 10.6 percent
of ADB total approvals, and one equity participation (in
Africa Reinsurance Corporation) for UA 3.2 million. There
was a decline (21.7 percent) in the private sector operations
in 2004 compared to 2003, when the ADB recorded 8 project loan approvals amounting to UA 205.8 million.

Private sector lending operations continued to support the
inancial sector through lines of credit (LOC). The 4 LOCs
went to 3 financial institutions in Botswana, Kenya, and

ee

South Africa. The LOCs to the National Development Bank of
Botswana and the Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) amounted
to UA 34.3 million and UA 9.8 million respectively. The 2
LOCs approved for South Africa, which are to be channeled
through Nedcor Limited, amounted to UA 117.1 million.
The Bank's equity participation was in the Third Capital
Increase of Africa Reinsurance Corporation (Africa-Re).

Cumulative ADB Loan and Grant Approvals by
Sector and Region

Since the year 1967, when the Bank operations began,
a cumulative total of 902 loans and grants amounting to
UA 20.61 billion have been approved from the ADB window. These include 67 non-publicly guaranteed private
sector operations for a total amount of UA 1.03 billion.

The sectoral distribution of cumulative approvals (see
Figure 6.3) reveals that the finance sector accounted for
the largest share (20.9 percent), followed by the trans

The Ghana Oil Palm Development Project

In December 2002 the Bank approved a loan of UA 5.4 million in cofinancing for the expansion of the Ghana Oil Palm
Development Company Limited (GOPDC). This private sector
project, whose total cost amounts to UA 18.76 million, aims
to expand oil palm cultivation, adopt the concept of sustainable agriculture, and focus on the production of organic oil
palm. The project is establishing a new 2,100 ha organic oil
palm nucleus estate in Okumaning; replanting 2,300 ha of
nucleus estate in Kwae; and developing 5,000 ha outgrower
and smallholder farms in both Okumaning and Kwae. It is also
expanding the capacity of the palm oil mill and the palm kernel
crushing plant, and establishing a new refinery.

The project has had a strong development impact. At the local
level, it injects capital into the economy of Kwaebibirim District
and helps increase the living standards of the rural population. The project employs 300 permanent staff and other
seasonal workers. The project has a strong gender component
in that women constitute about 30 percent of the permanent
workforce and up to 80 percent of the contract employees.
The Company seeks to close the gender gap in education, as
evidenced by gender parity in enrollment at the local school.

At the national level, the project is contributing to the development of the country’s oil palm industry, in particular, by producing more value added products. It is helping the Government
to generate tax revenues in excess of € 357,000 per annum
as well as foreign exchange earnings, thereby improving the
balance of payment position of the country.

 

GOPDC has also put in place a “Workplace HIV Policy”. The
aims of the policy are to (i) provide protection from discrimination in the workplace for people living with HIV/AIDS, (ii) prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS among the workforce, (iii) provide
care, support and counseling for those infected and affected,
and (iv) provide free counseling and testing for workers.

GOPDC is the first certified organic oil palm producer in Africa
and the Company’s strategy focuses on organic farming, which
discourages the use of agrochemicals and employs good solid
and liquid waste management practices. A key feature of the
project is the already
proven outgrower
and smallholder
scheme, which is
consistent with the
Bank's private sector
strategy of supporting linkages between
large private firms
and small /micro
operators in Africa.
The scheme already
involves 7,000 farmers and under the
expansion project,
will be extended by
an additional 1,500.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Subscriptions

As at December 31, 2004, the authorized capital stock
of the Bank remained unchanged at UA 21.87 billion
(2,187,000 shares). The authorized capital is made up of
236,520 paid-up shares (10.81 percent) and 1,950,480
callable shares (89.19 percent), and has been allocated
to regional and non-regional members for subscriptions
in the proportion of 3:2 respectively.

The Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V) became effective
in 1999 after approval by the Board of Governors in 1998.
Members are considered to have subscribed to capital
only when installments are fully paid. A member country’s
payment of the first installment will trigger subscription to
the entire callable capital portion of shares allocated to it.
Members are required to pay for their subscriptions in 8
equal and consecutive annual installments in cash or notes
encashable on demand in freely convertible currencies.

At year-end 2004, cumulative subscriptions stood at UA

21.60 billion (98.77 percent) of the authorized capital,

compared with UA 21.56 billion (98.58 percent) a year

earlier. The net increase in the level of subscriptions is

attributable to:

e Shares subscribed on payment of subsequent installments under GCI-IV and GCI-V;

e Shares withdrawn as a result of nonpayment of installments in arrears of more than 48 months in case of GCIIV, and 90 days in case of GCI-V, in accordance with the
Share Transfer Rules. Consequently, adjustments were
also made to the callable capital of the Bank; and

e Shares subscribed as a result of new allocations under
the Share Transfer Rules.

At the end of 2004, the total callable capital stood at UA
19.37 billion.

Capital Market Operations

During 2004 the Bank raised UA 418 million at a
weighted average cost of 6-month US Dollar LIBOR minus
27.4 basis points and a weighted average maturity of
4.24 years. The Bank has continued to consolidate its
presence in the public bond markets. After successful
global benchmark dollar bond issues in 2002 and 2003,
the Bank issued in November 2004 a US$ 500 million
bond transaction with maturity in January 2010 at the
lowest cost achieved so far by the Bank in the public
bond markets.

The Bank also raised funds through small-sized structured
transactions, executed with an attached swap, to take
advantage of attractive funding opportunities. In addition, the Bank returned to the Samurai market in Japan
through a JPY 5 billion transaction. All these transactions
were swapped into floating interest rate in US Dollars.

In summary, as of December 31, 2004, the borrowing

portfolio of the Bank, excluding embedded derivatives,

stood at UA 5.65 billion. The Bank is well within its debt

policy limits. The key debt ratios are as follows:

© Total debt/total callable capital (max 80 percent):
29.16 percent

© Senior debt/non-borrowing members’ callable capital
(max 80 percent): 58.00 percent

© ‘Total debt/usable capital (max 100 percent): 52.80
percent.

 

Bank Rating

The ratings agencies Standard & Poor's, Moody's, Fitch
Ratings, and the Japan Credit Rating Agency reaffirmed
their AAA and AA+ ratings of the African Development
Bank's senior and subordinated debt respectively, with a
stable outlook. Their ratings reflect the Bank's strong membership support, its preferred creditor status, sound capital
adequacy, and prudent financial management and policies.

Investments

The Bank's cash and treasury investments as of December
31, 2004 totaled UA 4.45 billion, compared to UA 4.07
billion at the end of 2003. Investment income for 2004
amounted to UA 123.6 million, representing a return of
2.9 percent on an average investment of 4.22 billion. ThisFIGURE 6.5a

Effective January 1, 2001, the ADB's liquid assets were
tranched into 3 portfolios, namely operational portfolio,
prudential portfolio, and equity-backed portfolio, each
with a different benchmark that reflects the cashflow
and risk profile of its assets and funding sources. These
benchmarks are one-month LIBID for the operational
portfolio, and 6-month LIBOR, resetting on February 1
and August 1 for the prudential portfolio. The equitybacked portfolio is managed against a repricing profile
benchmark with 10 percent of the Bank’s net assets
repricing uniformly over a period of 10 years.

Loan Portfolio

Loans signed, net of cancellations, as at December 31, 2004,
amounted to UA 15.99 billion. Total outstanding loans, as
at December 31, 2004, amounted to UA 5.22 billion, which
was UA 389.7 million lower than the UA 5.61 billion outstanding at the end of 2003. This decrease was attributable
primarily to prepayments during the year amounting to UA
541.8 million. Undisbursed balances at December 31, 2004
totaled UA 1.52 billion, a decrease of UA 278.1 million
from December 31, 2003. The number of active signed
loans stood at 317 for a total amount of UA 5.22 billion.

Financial Products

Loans

The Bank offers 3 loan products, namely, the variable,
floating, and fixed interest rate loans with a selection of
loan currencies, currently, US Dollars, Euro, Japanese Yen
(JPY) and South Africa Rand (ZAR). To suit the long-term
financing needs of borrowers, loans have a maximum
maturity of 20 years, including a grace period on the
repayment of the principal amount, generally not exceeding 5 years.

For the single currency variable interest rate loan, the
lending rate is determined twice a year, on January 1
and July 1, and is based on the Bank's average cost of a
designated pool of borrowings funding the loans in the
specific currency. The lending rate for the floating interest rate loan is derived from the 6-month market reference rate in the specific currency, for example, LIBOR,
EURIBOR, or JIBAR. The lending rate is reset on February
1 and August 1 each year and applies to the 6-month
period following the reset date. For the fixed interest
rate loan, the lending rate in each currency is the fixed
amortizing swap rate derived from the 6-month market
reference rates. Borrowers may select from a number of
rate-fixing alternatives, including fixing at each disbursement or after all disbursements have been completed.
Prior to rate fixing, the currency-specific floating interest
rate applies.

The pricing formula applicable to all 3 loan products is
the same. The applicable rate of interest is the sum of
the chosen base rate plus a lending spread. Sovereign
and sovereign-guaranteed borrowers benefit from the
Bank's ability to fund itself at levels below the market
reference rates (e.g. sub-LIBOR) since the computation
of lending rates includes a funding margin, which is the
Bank's funding spread relative to the market reference

rate. This funding margin is calculated each semester
and varies with the cost of the Bank's funding for
single-currency floating-rate loans. For sovereign and
sovereign-guaranteed borrowers, the lending spread is
50 basis points. For non-sovereign guaranteed borrowers in both the private and public sector, the lending
spread is computed based on the Bank's risk-based
pricing framework.

The distribution of loans by currency and interest rate
basis since 1997 is shown in Figures 6.6 and 6.7.

Risk Management Products

Risk management products are offered to enable borrowers to manage the market risks associated with their
loans from the Bank, including interest rate, currency, and
commodity price risks. These products assist borrowers to
manage their balance sheets and their changing needs
more efficiently over time. Risk management products
such as interest rate swaps, currency swaps, interest rate
caps and collars are available to borrowers at any time
during the life of the loan.

Guarantees
Through the guarantee product, the Bank seeks to leverage its preferred creditor status to assist eligible borrow-ers to obtain financing from third party lenders, including
the capital markets. Guarantees would also enable borrowers to obtain financing in their own local currency
where the Bank is not able to provide such financing
directly from its own resources.

Equity Participation or Quasi-Equity Products

The Bank's ability to provide risk capital through equity
investment is a key element of its resource mobilization
role. Even though the Bank will not be a majority shareholder in a company, it can participate in a project by
acquiring ordinary stocks, redeemable preferred stocks,
or debentures.

Other Financial Services

In addition to the products described above, the Bank,
through its private sector window, may offer loan syndication and underwriting services.

Risk Management Policies and Processes
Congruent to its role as a development finance institution, the African Development Bank seeks to reduce its
exposure to risks that are not essential to its core business
of providing development finance and related assistance.
To this end, the Bank has adapted its risk management
policies, guidelines, and processes to reduce exposure to
interest rate, currency, liquidity, counterparty, legal, and
other operational risks, while maximizing its capacity
to assume the risks of extending credit to its public and
private sector clients within its approved risk limits.

Credit Risk

Credit risk, the potential default of one or more debtors,
is the largest source of risk for the African Development
Bank and is managed within an integrated framework of
credit policies, guidelines, and processes. The foundation
of the Bank's credit management framework is a systematic credit risk assessment based on a uniform internal
credit risk rating scale that is calibrated to reflect the
Bank's statistical loss expectations.

The Bank manages 3 principal sources of credit risk: (i)
sovereign credit risk on its public sector portfolio; (ii)
non-sovereign credit risk on its portfolio of private sector,
non-sovereign and enclave projects; and (iii) counterparty
credit risk on its portfolio of treasury investments and
derivative instruments.

Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Bank lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the Borrowing Member State. Consequently,
the expected loss rate on the Bank's public sector portfolio is derived from regular assessments of the ultimate
collectibility risk of the sovereign guarantees from the
Borrowing Member States. The credit risk ratings of the
Bank's Borrowing Member States are updated quarterly
by the credit management division.

In 2004 the overall risk profile of the Bank’s sovereign guaranteed portfolio deteriorated marginally. The
portfolio’s weighted-average risk rating showed a marginal weakening from 2.92 at the end of 2003 to 2.97 in
2004. The distribution of the sovereign portfolio across
the Bank's 5 credit risk classes is shown in the table
below.

2000 19% 26% 42% 3% 10%
1999 18% 32% 37% 4% 9%

 

To ensure adequate diversification, the Bank maintains
a prudent distribution of its sovereign guaranteed portfolio through its exposure management policies. For
each eligible public sector borrower, the Bank applies an

 

' The maximum sustainable portfolio is the largest outstanding portfolio that can be supported by the current level of risk capital applying the Bank's capital adequacy policy.

ANNUAL REPORT 2004136

The African Development Bank

exposure limit that reflects the country’s risk rating and
its economic potential subject to a maximum loan equivalent exposure for any single country that is no more than
15 percent of the Bank’s maximum sustainable portfolio.’
The country exposure limits are reviewed annually and
are used as a risk-based benchmark to plan the Bank's
medium-term country assistance strategies.

It is the Bank's policy that if a payment of principal, interest or other charges with respect to any Bank Group
credit becomes 30 days overdue, no new loans to that
member country, or to any public sector borrower in
that country, will be presented to the Board of Directors
for approval, nor will any previously approved loan be
signed, until all arrears are cleared. Further, for such
countries, disbursements on all loans to or guaranteed
by that member country are suspended until all overdue
amounts have been paid. These countries also become
ineligible in the subsequent billing period for a waiver of
0.50 percent on the commitment fees charged on qualifying undisbursed ADB loans.

Although the Bank benefits from the advantages of
preferred creditor status and rigorously applies sanctions
on non-performing sovereign borrowers, some countries
have experienced difficulties to service their debts to the
Bank on a timely basis. In line with best practice, the
Bank makes a general provision for the expected losses
in its sovereign portfolio commensurate with the assessment of the collectibility risk inherent in the portfolio.
The Bank's general provisioning rate of 8.84 percent at
the end of 2004 was within the range of expected losses
for the sovereign portfolio and is considered appropriate
at this time. The Bank will continue to adapt its methodologies for determining provisions in line with the
impairment rules specified in the international accounting standards.”

To cover potential unexpected credit-related losses due to
extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a
conservative risk capital cushion for sovereign credit risks.
The Bank's capital adequacy policy articulates differentiated risk capital requirements for all credit-sensitive assets
(loans and equity investments) plus contingent liabilities
(guarantees and client risk management products) in

each risk class.? At the end of 2004, the Bank’s public
sector portfolio required as backing, 47 percent of the
Bank's total on-balance sheet risk capital.4 This compares
with 51 percent at the end of 2003 and reflects both the
changes in the portfolio size and risk profile as well as
continued strong growth of the Bank’s risk capital base.

Non-Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Bank lends to private sector borrowers or to
enclave projects, it does not benefit from full sovereign
guarantees or the equivalent. The Bank may also provide
financing to creditworthy commercially oriented entities
that are publicly owned, without a sovereign guarantee.
Consequently, the expected loss rate on its non-sovereign portfolio is derived from the assessment of the
ultimate collectibility risk of each project loan, including
any security or guarantees. The credit management division assigns a credit risk rating for all new projects at
entry and the risk ratings on all outstanding projects are
updated quarterly.

In 2004 the non-sovereign loan and equity portfolios
continued to grow. By year-end the weighted-average
risk rating improved from 3.7 in 2003 to 3.4 in 2004.
The distribution of the non-sovereign portfolio across the
Bank's 5 credit risk classes is shown in the table below.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2004 14% 14% 55% 10% 6%
2003 0% 20% 62% 10% 8%
2002 19% 0% 58% 18% 5%
2001 0% 0% 57% 26% 17%
2000 0% 0% 68% 11% 21%
1999 0% 0% 56% 8% 36%

 

 

 

 

To ensure a prudent distribution of its non-sovereign
portfolio, the Bank manages its lending activities within
a framework of country, sector, client, and instrument
exposure limits and risk profile benchmarks. In addition,
the Bank generally requires a range of securities and
guarantees from the project sponsors to partially mitigate
the credit risk for direct private sector loans.

 

 

The Bank is preparing for a possible transition from an “expected-loss” provisioning framework to the “incurred-loss” based model set forth in |AS39.
Reflecting its higher risk operating environment and unavoidable portfolio concentrations, the Bank requires risk capital backing that is three to ten times more conservative than BIS

commercial banking standards. Very low risk = 25%, low risk = 28%, moderate risk = 35%, high risk = 50%, very high risk = 75%, and equity investments = 100%.

The Bank defines risk capital as the sum of paid-in capital, accumulated reserves plus general provisions net of translation adjustments. Reflecting a conservative approach to measuring

capital adequacy for operational planning, the Bank does not include callable capital in its computation of risk capital.

ANNUAL REPORT 2004To cover the expected losses in the performing non-sovereign portfolio, the Bank makes a general provision on the
total loan equivalent exposure based on individual project
risk ratings. For the non-performing portfolio, the Bank
makes a specific provision based on an assessment of the
credit impairment of each loan. At the end of 2004, the
average general provisioning rate in the non-sovereign
portfolio was equal to 3.8 percent of the performing loan
portfolio, whereas the average specific provisioning rate
was 83.8 percent of the non-performing loan portfolio.

In addition to lending, the Bank may make equity
investments in private sector projects either directly or
through investment funds. To the extent possible, equity
investments are carried at fair value. In cases where an
equity investment that is not fair valued is assessed as
potentially non-performing, the Bank may make a provision based on accepted impairment tests measured
against the Bank's carrying cost. At the end of 2004,
the average provisioning rate for equity investments
was equivalent to 2.7 percent of the outstanding equity
portfolio.

To cover potential unexpected credit related losses due to
extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a
conservative risk capital cushion for non-sovereign credit
risks. At the end of 2004, the Bank's non-sovereign portfolio required as backing approximately 4.1 percent of
the Bank's total on-balance sheet risk capital, compared
to 3.1 percent at the end of 2003. This was still well
below the limit of 20 percent for total non-sovereign
operations.

Counterparty Credit Risk

In the normal course of its business, the Bank utilizes
various financial instruments to meet the needs of its borrowers, to manage its exposure to fluctuations in market
interest and currency rates, and to temporarily invest
its liquidity prior to disbursement. All of these financial
instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the
counterparty in the transaction may be unable to meet its
obligation to the Bank.

Reflecting a preference for minimizing exposure to counterparty credit risk, the Bank maintains eligibility criteria
that limit the Bank's financial operations to counterparties with the very best credit ratings. For example, the
minimum rating for counterparties for derivative instruments is AA- or the equivalent.

 

In addition to these stringent rating standards, the Bank
operates a framework of exposure limits based on the
counterparty credit rating and size subject to a maximum
of 8 percent of the Bank's total risk capital for any single
counterparty. Individual counterparty credit exposures
are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) potential exposure methodology and monitored regularly against the Bank's credit
limits after considering the benefits of any collateral. As
a rule, the Bank executes an ISDA master agreement
and netting agreement with its derivative counterparties
prior to undertaking any transactions. As shown below,
the estimated potential counterparty credit exposure of
the investment and derivative portfolios remained largely
unchanged, with a small bias towards AAA credits.

2000 52% 43% 4% 0%
1999 30% 64% 6% 0%

 

 

 

 

 

To cover potential unexpected credit related losses due
to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains
a conservative risk capital cushion for counterparty credit
risks as per the current BIS standards. At the end of 2004,
the Bank’s counterparty credit portfolio including all
investments and derivative instruments required as backing just over 1.7 percent of the Bank's total on-balance
sheet risk capital. This is broadly unchanged from 2003.

Liquidity Risk

As long-term development lender, the Bank holds sufficient liquid assets to enable it to continue normal
operations, even in the unlikely event that it is unable
to obtain fresh resources from the capital markets for an
extended period of time. To achieve this objective, the
Bank computes a prudential minimum level of liquidity
based on the projected net cash requirement for a rolling
one-year period. The prudential minimum level of liquidity is updated quarterly and includes all potential debt
service payments due to early redemption of swaps and
borrowings with embedded options. To enable the Bank
to take advantage of low-cost funding opportunities as
they arise, the Bank's policy permits a judicious increase

The African Development Bank

of liquid resources where there is an economic benefit.
Throughout 2004, the level of liquid assets remained
well above the minimum prescribed by the Bank's liquid
ity policy.

To strike the optimal balance between generating adequate investment returns and holding securities that can
be easily sold for cash if required, the Bank divides its
investment portfolio into tranches with different liquidity objectives and benchmarks. The Bank's core liquidity
portfolio is invested in relatively liquid securities that can
be readily sold if required. In addition to the core portfolio, the Bank maintains a second tranche of liquidity that
is always invested in the most highly liquid securities to
cover its expected operational cash flow needs. Probable
redemptions of swaps and borrowings with embedded
options are included in the computation of the size of
the operational tranche of liquidity. A third tranche of
liquidity, which is funded by the Bank's equity resources,
is held in a portfolio of fixed income securities designated
as “held-to-maturity” investments (HTM). Only HTM
investments with a remaining maturity of one year or less
are considered as liquid investments against the Bank's
minimum liquidity requirements.

Currency Risk

The Agreement Establishing the Bank explicitly prohibits it
from taking direct currency exchange exposures by requiring liabilities in any one currency (after swap activities)
to be matched with assets in the same currency. This is
achieved primarily by holding or lending the proceeds of
its borrowings in the same currencies in which they were
borrowed (after swap activities). To avoid creating new
currency mismatches, the Bank requires its borrowers to
service their loans in the currencies disbursed. However,
to facilitate loan repayment for its borrowers that may not
have easy access to certain currencies, the Bank provides
currency exchange services on an agency basis.

Because a large part of its balance sheet is funded by
equity resources, which are denominated in Units of
Account (equivalent to the SDR), the Bank has a net
asset position that is potentially exposed to translation
risk when currency exchange rates fluctuate. The Bank’s
policy is to minimize the potential fluctuation of the
value of its net worth measured in Units of Account by
matching, to the extent possible, the currency composi
ee

tion of its net assets with the currency basket of the
SDR. In line with this policy, throughout 2004 the Bank's
currency alignment was adjusted within a band of +/- 1
percent of the risk-neutral position in each of the currencies making up the SDR composition. As a result,
despite sharp movements in the values of the major
currencies during the year, the Bank registered only a
minor change in translation adjustments of less than 0.5
percent of net assets.

The distribution of the currencies of the Bank's recurring
administrative expenditures shows a high concentration of
expenses in Euros, CFA, and Tunisian Dinar. For 2004, the
Bank's strategy of purchasing Euros in the forward market
to cover the estimated amount of Euro and Euro-related
expenses during the year partially mitigated the unfavorable
impact of the sharp increase in the value of the Euro.

Interest Rate Risk

The Bank's exposure to interest rate risk can be traced to
2 principal sources: i) the interest rate sensitivity of the
net interest margin between the rate the Bank earns on
its assets and the cost of the borrowings funding those
assets; and ii) the interest rate sensitivity of the interest margin the Bank earns on the assets funded by its
equity resources. The Bank's principal interest rate risk
management objective is to generate a stable overall net
interest margin’. It is understood that as an inevitable
part of managing interest rate risk, the strategies that
would help to stabilize the Bank's net interest margin
(longer duration of equity) would often lead to increased
volatility of the economic value of the Bank's equity on a
mark-to-market basis.

Assets Funded by Debt

Over half of the Bank's interest-rate-sensitive assets are
funded by debt. The Bank seeks to generate a stable net
interest margin on assets funded by debt by matching
the interest rate characteristics of each class of assets
and liabilities.

 

In 1990 the Bank began offering “variable rate loans”,
with an interest rate that resets semi-annually, based on
the average cost of a dedicated pool of the Bank's borrowings. These pools are funded with a mix of fixed rate
and floating rate borrowings to provide borrowers with
broadly stable interest rates that gradually track changes

* A net interest margin that is not overly sensitive to sharp changes in market interest rates yet adequately responsive to general market trends.

ANNUAL REPORT 2004in market interest rates. The cost of funds’ pass-through
formulation incorporated in the lending rates charged on
the Bank's pool-based loans has traditionally helped to
minimize the interest rate sensitivity of the net interest
margin on this part of its loan portfolio. In view of declining demand for this product in favor of market-based
loans, the Bank is carefully managing the gradual winding down of the designated funding pools.

The Bank also offers fixed and floating rate loans where
the interest rate is directly linked to market interest rates.
For the market-based loan products, the Bank's net
interest margin is preserved by using swaps to align the
interest rate sensitivity of the loans with that of the Bank's
underlying funding (6-month LIBOR floating rate). The
Bank may also provide borrowers with risk management
products such as swaps to modify the currency and interest rate terms of its market-based loan products. Although
it prefers to retain the credit risks, the Bank safeguards the
intermediation fee it earns on risk management products
by simultaneously laying off the market risks with an
approved derivative counterparty.

For the portfolio of liquid assets funded by borrowings,
the Bank protects its net interest margin by managing
its investments within duration mismatch limits around
benchmarks that replicate the interest rate characteristics of the underlying funding for each portfolio
tranche. The portfolio of liquid assets funded by borrowings is currently divided into 2 tranches to reflect the
different business purposes and underlying funding. The
core part of the investment portfolio is held to comply
with the Bank's liquidity policy and uses a 6-month
LIBOR floating rate benchmark. The operational liquidity portfolio is managed to meet projected operational
cash flow needs and uses a one-month LIBOR floating
rate benchmark.

 

The Bank diversifies the sources of its funding by issuing debt in a variety of markets and instruments. Unless
fixed rate funding is required for one of its pool-based
loan products, the Bank protects its net interest margin
by simultaneously swapping all new borrowings into
floating rate in one of the Bank’s active currencies on
a standard 6-month LIBOR rate reference. Where the
Bank issues debt with embedded options, the Bank
simultaneously enters into a swap with matching terms
to synthetically create the desired 6-month LIBOR-based
floating rate funding. For risk management purposes,
callable funding is considered as one alternative to issu
 

ing short-term debt such as Euro Commercial Paper. The
Bank manages refinancing risk by limiting the amount of
debt that will mature or is potentially callable within one
year to 25 percent of the outstanding debt portfolio.

Assets Funded by Equity

The second principal source of interest rate risk is the
interest rate sensitivity of the income earned from funding a significant portion of the Bank's assets with equity
resources. Changes in market interest rates in the currencies of the Bank's equity resources (the SDR) affect the
net interest margin earned on assets funded by equity
resources. In general, lower nominal market interest rates
result in lower lending and investment rates, which in
the long term reduce the nominal earnings on the Bank's
equity resources.

The Bank manages the interest rate profile of the
assets funded by equity resources with the objective
of reducing the sensitivity of the net interest margin to
fluctuations in market interest rates. This is achieved
by continuously adjusting the repricing profile of the
assets funded by the Bank's equity resources (fixed rate
loans and investments) to match a repricing profile
benchmark. The Bank's repricing profile benchmark is
a 10-year ladder whereby a uniform 10 percent of the
Bank's assets funded by equity reprice in each year.
Using this benchmark, the Bank's net interest margin on
assets funded by equity tends to track a 10-year moving
average of 10-year maturity SDR interest rates. At the
end of 2004, the Bank's overall repricing profile was
closely aligned to the benchmark in all annual buckets.
For net assets repricing within one year, the Bank had a
manageable gap relative to the benchmark.

In addition to these 2 principal sources of interest rate
risk, the Bank is exposed to prepayment risk on the parts
of its loan portfolio issued before 1997. Although the
Bank is unable to charge a prepayment penalty on these
older loans, in practice the level of prepayments has generally been within acceptable levels. In 2003, however,
driven by low market interest rates, contracting credit
spreads for emerging market borrowers, and enhanced
debt management by several sovereign borrowers, total
loan prepayments increased sharply to UA 471 million.
In 2004, an additional UA 542 million of fixed and poolbased loans were prepaid, representing about 10 percent
of the loan portfolio at the beginning of the year. For all
market-based loans issued since 1997, the Bank protects
itself from prepayment risk by linking the prepayment

penalty to the cost of redeploying the funds at current
market rates.

Operational Risk

The Bank, like all financial institutions, is exposed to many
types of operational risks, including the potential losses
arising from internal activities or external events caused
by breakdowns in information, communication, physical
safeguards, business continuity, supervision, transaction
processing, settlement systems and procedures, and
the execution of legal, fiduciary, and agency responsibilities. The Bank maintains a comprehensive system of
internal controls and back-up procedures designed to
keep operational risk at appropriate levels, in view of the
Bank's financial strength and the characteristics of the
activities and markets in which it operates. These internal
controls are periodically updated to conform to industry
est practice.

n 2004 internal control improvements focused on comleting the implementation of the Bank’s main treasury
management IT systems to reduce the ambient level of
operational risk in the Bank's trading activities and to
acilitate reporting of its financial instruments in compliance with international financial reporting standards. In
addition, the Bank began the process of implementing
COSO, an internationally recognized internal control
ramework, with a view to consolidate and enhance the
existing internal control processes.

Risk Management Process

he processes and procedures by which the Bank manages its risk profile continually evolve as its activities
change in response to market, credit, product, and other
developments. The highest level of risk management
is assured by the Bank's Board of Executive Directors,
which is chaired by the President. In addition to approving all risk management policies, the Executive Directors
regularly review trends in the Bank’s risk profiles and performance to ensure compliance with those policies. An
independent risk management team supports the Bank's
risk management process.

 

The Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) is
the Bank's most senior management forum on risk management issues. ALCO is chaired by the Vice President

ee

(Finance) and meets at least once monthly to perform its
oversight role. Among its key functions, the committee
reviews regular and ad-hoc finance and risk management
reports and projections, approves strategies to adjust the
balance sheet, and confirms country and project credit
risk ratings and the associated expected loss estimates.
ALCO is supported by 7 standing working groups
that report to the committee on specific risk management issues. These working groups cover country risk,
commercial credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk,
financial projections, financial products and services, and
operational risk.

Day-to-day operational responsibility for implementing
the Bank's risk management policies and guidelines is
delegated to the appropriate business units.

FINANCIAL RESULTS

The financial results of the Bank for 2004 are consistent with the objective to earn a level of income that
is adequate to ensure the financial strength necessary
for supporting and sustaining its development activities.
Operating income, defined as the net income before the
unrealized IAS 39 fair valuation adjustments, amounted
to UA 219.9 million for 2004, compared to UA 178.3
million for 2003. The Bank reported a net income of UA
107.4 million for 2004, compared to UA 96.7 million in
2003°. The unrealized fair valuation adjustments (losses)
included in net income for 2004 and 2003 amounted to
UA 112.5 million and UA 81.6 million, respectively. These
unrealized amounts included in net income arise from the
fair valuation of certain non-trading derivative financial
instruments, pursuant to the adoption by the Bank of
International Accounting Standard 39 (IAS 39) “Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”. The derivative financial instruments relate primarily to the Bank's
borrowing transactions and are effective in accomplishing
the desired asset/liability management objectives of the
Bank. Since the underlying borrowing transactions are not
carried at fair value, the gains or losses on these underlying borrowing transactions are not available to offset the
gains or losses on the derivative financial instruments.
Consequently, the unrealized gains or losses from the
derivative financial instruments are deemed to represent

5 Net income for 2003 was restated from the UA 117.4 million previously reported to UA 96.7 milllion, due to a correction to the unrealized net loss on non-trading derivatives - IAS
39 Adjustment. Operating income, the basis for decision-making, was not affected by the restatement.

volatilities, which do not reflect the economic substance
of the underlying transactions and accordingly are not relevant for management decision-making. Other highlights
of the Bank's performance in 2004 include the following:

Net operational income increased from UA 227.1
million in 2003 to UA 253.4 million for 2004. As a
result of lower average outstanding loans, income
from loans decreased from UA 325.5 million in 2003
to UA 310.5 million in 2004. However, the decrease
in loan income was more than offset by an increase
in investment income, which rose by 23.9 percent,
from UA 99.8 million in 2003 to UA 123.6 million in
2004. Interest expense also decreased by 9.4 percent
from UA 219.6 million in 2003 to UA 198.8 million
in 2004. Based on collectibility risk analysis under the
Bank’s loan loss provisioning policy and due to reductions in the level of principal outstanding on public
sector sovereign guaranteed loans, and improvement
in quality of such loans, accumulated provisions for
loan losses decreased, resulting in a net write-back
to income of loan loss provisions of UA 18.2 million
in 2004. There was also a write-back to income of
provision for equity investments of UA 3.5 million in
2004. Administrative expenses also decreased by UA
8.0 million from UA 45.1 million in 2003 to UA 37.1
million in 2004 due to certain one-time expenses
incurred in 2003 relating to the temporary relocation
of the Bank's operations to Tunis.

The Bank continues to maintain a stable risk-bearing
capacity. As a result of the allocation from 2003 net
income approved by the Board of Governors in May
2004, reserves net of cumulative currency translation
adjustments decreased slightly by UA 21.1 million or
1.4 percent, from UA 1.51 billion at December 31,
2003 to UA 1.49 billion at December 31, 2004. Total
reserves (i.e. including accumulated loan loss provisions) at December 31, 2004 amounted to UA 1.94
billion or 37.1 percent of loans outstanding at the end
of the year. Reserves at December 31, 2004 included a
cumulative unrealized net loss on non-trading derivatives (IAS 39 Adjustment) of UA 85.5 million.

 

In 2004 the number of borrowers in non-accrual
status (including the Democratic Republic of Congo)
was 10, compared to 11 in 2003. In 2002, in accordance with the terms of an exceptional arrears
clearance mechanism for the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) coordinated with other multilateral

development finance institutions and approved by
the Board of Directors, the amounts receivable from
DRC less payments received from the DRC and
certain donors in partial satisfaction of the DRC’s
indebtedness were consolidated into new loans.
Following the consolidation, the DRC became contractually current on its loans. However, the loans to
the DRC continue to be maintained in non-accrual
status pending a period of satisfactory performance.
Excluding the previous interest and charges receivable of UA 417.9 million from the DRC now included
in the consolidated DRC loans, the cumulative interest income not recognized by the Bank relating to all
loans in non-accrual status amounted to UA 366.1
million compared to UA 347.8 million at December
31, 2003. Loan income not recognized in 2004 due
to loans in non-accrual status amounted to UA 61.3
million, compared to UA 80.8 million in 2003.

At December 31, 2004, accumulated provision for
losses on public sector sovereign guaranteed loans
represented 8.6 percent of the outstanding balance
compared to 8.4 percent at the end of 2003. The 8.6
percent rate was at the higher end of the range of
probable loss estimates determined by Management
for public sector sovereign guaranteed loans and is
consistent with the Bank's loan loss provisioning policy. Management considers the level of accumulated
provisions at December 31, 2004 to be adequate.
Based on the loan-by-loan review of the collectibility
risk of the non-sovereign guaranteed (i.e. private sector) loan portfolio, a provision of UA 9.2 million was
made in 2004, compared to UA 8.1 million in 2003.

Administrative expenses, net of reimbursement by
ADF and NTF for their share of such expenses,
decreased by UA 8.0 million from UA 45.1 million
in 2003 to UA 37.1 million in 2004. The decrease
in total administrative expenses of the Bank Group
was due to certain one-time expenses incurred in
2003, relating to the temporary relocation of the
Bank to Tunis. The share of administrative expenses
between the Bank, the ADF, and NTF is based on a
predetermined cost-sharing formula driven primarily
by the relative levels of certain operational volume
indicators.

Net income allocation decisions of the Bank are driv
en primarily by the adequacy of reserves. Over the last
few years, the Bank has earned levels of net income

sufficient to enable the Bank, not only to maintain a
stable level of reserves position, but also contribute to
other development initiatives for Africa. In 2004, the
Board of Governors approved allocations of UA 114.6
million out of the 2003 income. The allocation comprised UA 6.0 million to the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) initiative, UA 10.0 million to ADF,
UA 45.0 million to the Post Conflict Countries Facility
(PCCF), and UA 53.6 million to the special fund for
post-conflict assistance to the Democratic Republic of
Congo.

International Accounting Standard 39 (IAS 39), adopted
by the Bank effective January 1, 2001, requires among
other things that all derivative financial instruments
be marked to fair value and reported on the balance
sheet. The Bank uses derivative financial instruments
for asset/liability management purposes to achieve
desired economic hedges and also to achieve lower
borrowing costs. Management believes that the Bank's
current portfolio of derivative financial instruments
achieves such purposes. However, the marking to
fair value of these derivatives without marking to fair
value the related underlying borrowing transactions
introduces volatility in the Bank’s reported earnings
that is not reflective of the Bank's asset/liability and risk

management strategies. To enable Management and
he Board of Directors to make informed judgments,
he results of the asymmetrical marking to fair value
described above are isolated in the line described as
“Unrealized net loss on non-trading derivatives — IAS
39 Adjustment” on the income statement. Further,
0 insulate economic decisions from the volatility in
he IAS 39 Adjustment, the Boards have since 2001
agreed with Management that Operating Income,
hat is, income before the IAS 39 Adjustment, should
be the basis for economic and managerial decisions.
Additionally, the financial performance indicators used
0 assess the financial strength of the Bank exclude the
effects of the IAS 39 Adjustment.

 

n 2003 and 2004, the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB) revised several International
Accounting Standards, including IAS 39, as part of
ongoing efforts to eliminate redundancies or inconsistencies between existing standards. The revised
standards are to be applied for fiscal years beginning
on or after January 1, 2005. The Bank is applying the
revised standards to its financial statements starting
in 2005 and expects certain significant changes, particularly relating to anticipated decreases in provisioning for impairment on loans.~

158 ANNUAL REPORT 2004The African Development Bank

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003

Note A - Operations and Affiliated Organizations

The African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to
the economic and social progress of its regional member states. The Bank finances development projects and
programs in its regional member states, typically in cooperation with other national or international development institutions. In furtherance of this objective, the Bank participates in the selection, study and preparation
of projects contributing to such development and, where necessary, provides technical assistance. The Bank also
promotes investments of public and private capital in projects and programs designed to contribute to the economic and social progress of the regional member states. The activities of the Bank are complemented by those
of the African Development Fund (ADF or the Fund), which was established by the Bank and certain countries;
and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund administered by the ADB. Notably, each of the ADB,
ADF, and NTF has separate assets and liabilities, and the ADB is not liable for their respective obligations. The ADF
was established to assist the Bank in contributing to the economic and social development of the Bank's regional
members, to promote cooperation and increased international trade particularly among the Bank’s members, and
to provide financing on concessional terms for such purposes.

Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The Bank's financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board. The financial statements have been prepared
under the historical cost convention except for fair valuation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities and
all derivative contracts where it adopts the fair value basis of accounting.

The significant accounting policies employed by the Bank are summarized below.
Accounting for Derivatives

The Bank adopted the original International Accounting Standard 39 (IAS 39), “Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measurement”, on January 1, 2001. IAS 39 requires that all derivatives be measured at fair value and reported on the balance sheet. The Bank uses derivative instruments in its portfolios for asset/liability management, cost
reduction, risk management and hedging purposes. Although IAS 39 allows special hedge accounting for certain
qualifying hedging relationships, the application of such special hedge accounting criteria does not make evident
the asset/liability and risk management strategy of the Bank and would result in certain hedged instruments being
carried at fair value, while other similar hedged instruments are carried at amortized cost. Consequently, the
Bank has elected not to define any qualifying hedging relationships, but rather marks all derivatives to fair value,
with all changes in fair value recognized in income. The effect of the adoption of IAS 39 relates primarily to the
derivatives in the borrowings portfolio. No adjustment is required to the investments portfolio held for trading,
since those derivatives were already recorded at fair value, prior to the adoption of the original IAS 39.

Upon adoption of IAS 39, a transition adjustment was made directly to retained earnings. This transition adjustment represented primarily the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the embedded derivatives and derivative instruments as defined in IAS 39 in the borrowing portfolio and loan portfolio as at January
1, 2001, offset by any gain or losses on those borrowings for which fair value exposure was being hedged.

Accounting and Financial Reporting Developments

In 2003 and 2004, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) revised several International Accounting
Standards, including IAS 39, as part of ongoing efforts to eliminate redundancies or inconsistencies between
existing standards. The revised standards are to be applied for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2005.
The Bank is applying the revised standards to its financial statements starting in 2005 and expects certain significant changes, particularly relating to anticipated decreases in provisioning for impairment on loans.

Monetary Basis of Financial Statements

The financial statements are presented in Units of Account (UA). The value of the Unit of Account is defined in
Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank (the Agreement) as equivalent to one Special Drawing
Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF.

Translation of Currencies

The Bank conducts its operations in several currencies, but principally in the basket of currencies that constitute
the SDR of the IMF. Income and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities other than non-monetary items denominated in UA are translated into UA at rates
prevailing at the balance sheet date. Translation differences are debited or credited directly to retained earnings
under Cumulative Currency Translation Adjustment (CCTA) and also reported as part of “Other Comprehensive
Income”. Capital Subscriptions are recorded in UA at the rates prevailing at the time of receipt. This is composed
of the UA amount at the predetermined rate net of the difference between the predetermined rate and the
rate at the time of receipt. Such difference is described in the Financial Statements as Cumulative Exchange
Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS).

When currencies are converted into other currencies, the resulting gains or losses are included in the determinaion of net income.

Revenue recognition

nterest income is accrued based on the terms of the related financial instrument and for the time that such
instrument is outstanding and held by the Bank, using the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate
hat discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial asset to the asset's net
carrying amount. Interest and other charges are not accrued on overdue loans which management considers as
non-performing.

ncome from investment includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading financial instruments and
he amortization of premiums and discounts calculated on the constant yield basis for the held-to-maturity

inancial instruments.

Loans

 

he Bank's loan portfolio comprises loans guaranteed by borrowing member countries as well as certain other
non-sovereign guaranteed loans. Amounts disbursed on loans are repayable in the currency or currencies disbursed
by the Bank or in other freely convertible currency or currencies approved by the Bank. The amount repayable in
each of these currencies shall be equal to the amount disbursed in the original currency. Loans are granted for a
maximum period of 20 years, including a grace period, which is typically the period of project implementation.

The Bank places in non-accrual status all loans to, or guaranteed by a member country, if principal, interest or
other charges with respect to any such loan are overdue by 6 months or more, unless the Bank's management

160 ANNUAL REPORT 2004The African Development Bank

determines that the overdue amount will be collected in the immediate future. Further, management may place a
loan in non-accrual status even if it is not yet overdue by 6 months, if the specific facts and circumstances including consideration of events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date warrant such action. In addition, if
loans made by the ADF or the NTF to a member country are placed in non-accrual status, all loans made to or
guaranteed by that member country are also placed in non-accrual status by the Bank. When a loan is placed in
non-accrual status, all related unpaid interest and other charges are reversed against current income. Interest and
other charges on loans in non-accrual status are included in income only when actually received by the Bank. In
general, loans are returned to accrual status immediately after the related arrears have been cleared. However,
certain loans that have become current may continue to be carried in non-accrual status until after a period of
satisfactory performance.

The Bank may experience delays in receiving loan repayments from certain borrowers. The Bank maintains a
general provision for possible loan losses based on an assessment of the collectibility risk of the disbursed and outstanding public sector loan portfolio for the present value losses associated with such delays. For the private sector
portfolio, the Bank assesses collectibility risk on a loan-by-loan basis and provides for loan losses accordingly.

It is the Bank's practice not to reschedule interest or principal payments on its loans or participate in debt rescheduling agreements with respect to its loans.

Arrears Clearance Operations
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)

In connection with an internationally coordinated effort between the Bank, the International Monetary Fund
(the IMF), the World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) in its reconstruction efforts, the Board of Directors on June 26, 2002 approved an arrears clearance plan for
the DRC. Under the arrears clearance plan, contributions received from the donor community were used immediately for partial clearance of the arrears owed by the DRC. The residual amount of DRC'’s arrears to the Bank and
loan amounts not yet due have been consolidated into new contractual receivables, such that the present value
of the new loans equals the present value of the amounts that were owed under the previous contractual terms.
The new loans carry the weighted average interest rate of the old loans. In approving the arrears clearance plan,
the Board of Directors considered the following factors: a) the arrears clearance plan is part of an internationally
coordinated arrangement for the DRC; b) the magnitude of DRC’s arrears to the Bank ruled out conventional solutions; c) the prolonged armed conflict in the DRC has created extensive destruction of physical assets, such that
the DRC had almost no capacity for servicing its debt; and d) the proposed package would result in a significant
improvement in its repayment capacity, if appropriate supporting measures are taken. Furthermore, there was
no automatic linkage between the arrears clearance mechanism and the debt relief that may be subsequently
provided on the consolidated facility. In June 2004, the DRC reached its decision point under the Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Consequently, the consolidated facility has since that date benefited from partial
debt service relief under HIPC.

A special account, separate from the assets of the Bank, has been established for all contributions towards the DRC
arrears clearance plan. Such contributions may include allocations of the net income of the Bank that the Board of
Governors of the Bank may from time to time make to the special account, representing the Bank's contribution to the
arrears clearance plan. The amount of such net income allocation is subject to the approval of the Boards of Governors
of the Bank, typically occurring during the annual general meeting of the Bank. Consequently, income received on the
consolidated DRC loans is recognized in current earnings and is transferred out of reserves to the special account only
after the formal allocation, in whole or in part, of such amount by the Board of Governors of the Bank. The amount
of income from the DRC consolidated loan included in the reported earnings is disclosed in Note J.

ANNUAL REPORT 2004 161ss) The African Development Bank

Assistance to Post-Conflict Countries

The Bank has established a framework to assist post-conflict countries in clearing their loan arrears to the Bank
Group. The framework entails the setting aside of a pool of resources with contributions from the ADB net
income allocations and contributions from the ADF. Contributions would also be accepted from third parties that
are interested in facilitating the process of re-engaging the post-conflict countries in the development process
and in assisting them to reach the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) decision point. Resources would be
provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine post-conflict countries not yet receiving debt relief to fill financing
gaps after maximum effort by the post-conflict country to clear its arrears to the Bank Group. In this connection,
the Board of Governors by its Resolution B/BG/2004/07 of May 25, 2004 approved an allocation of UA 45 million
from the 2003 net income of the Bank, to the Post-Conflict Countries Fund (PCCF). Contributions received from
ADB will not be used to clear debts owed to the Bank by beneficiary post-conflict countries. The resources of the
PCCF are kept separate and distinct from those of the ADB.

Equity Investments

The Bank may take equity positions in privately owned productive enterprises and financial intermediaries, or
public sector companies that are in the process of being privatised or regional and sub-regional institutions. The
Bank's objective in such equity investments is to promote the economic development of its regional member
countries and in particular the development of their private sectors. The Bank's equity participation is also intended to promote efficient use of resources, promoting African participation, playing a catalytic role in attracting
other investors and lenders and mobilizing flow of domestic and external resources to financially viable projects
which also have significant economic merit.

The Bank's participation in the equity of any institution should not exceed twenty five percent (25%) of the total
equity capital of the institution. The Bank will therefore not seek a controlling interest in the companies in which
it invests but will closely monitor its equity investments through Board representation. In accordance with the
Board of Governors’ Resolution B/BG/2001/09 of May 29, 2001, total equity investment by the Bank shall not
at any time exceed ten percent (10%) of the aggregate amount of the Bank's paid-up capital and reserves and
surplus included in its ordinary capital resources.

The Bank classifies its equity investments as available for sale. Generally, there are no quoted market prices for
the Bank’s equity investments. Consequently, the fair values of the equity investments are estimated if reasonably
determinable; otherwise equity investments are carried at cost. The Bank records changes in fair value through
reserves, as disclosed in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Changes in Reserves, until the investment
is sold, at which time the cumulative profit or loss previously recognized in reserves is included in the income
statement. Equity investments for which fair value cannot be reliably measured are reported at cost less provision for losses for estimated permanent and lasting decline in value. The investments for which fair value cannot
be reliably measured typically relate to sub-regional and national development institutions. Investments in these
institutions are made with a long-term development objective, including capacity building. The shares of such
institutions are not listed and also not available for sale to the general public. Only member states or institutions
owned by member states are allowed to subscribe to the shares of these institutions. Provision for losses on
impaired equity investments are included in the income statement.

Fixed Assets
Land is stated at cost, including charges for reclamation. No depreciation is provided.

Buildings are shown at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated at a rate which is expected
to amortize the cost in equal annual installments over the useful life, which is estimated at between 15 to 20

162 ANNUAL REPORT 2004The African Development Bank

years. Financial charges incurred in connection with funds borrowed for the construction of buildings are capitalized during the construction period. Major improvements are depreciated over the remaining period of the
estimated useful life of the building concerned. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the
remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement.

Fixtures and fittings, furniture and equipment, motor vehicles and computer system software are stated at cost
less accumulated depreciation. Such assets are depreciated on a straight line basis with no salvage values. Fixtures
and fittings are depreciated over periods ranging from 6 to 10 years. Furniture and equipment are depreciated
over periods ranging between 3 to 7 years. Computer system software are depreciated over periods ranging from
3 to 5 years while motor vehicles are depreciated over 5 years.

Accounting For Leases

The Bank has entered into operating lease agreements for its offices in Tunisia and in certain regional member countries. Under such agreements, all the risks and benefits of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor. Payments
made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the
lease. When an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required to be made
to the lessor by way of penalty is recognised as an expense in the period in which the termination takes place.

Borrowings

In the ordinary course of its business, the Bank borrows worldwide in the major capital markets. The proceeds
of such borrowings are used for lending and liquidity purposes. The Bank issues debt instruments denominated
in various currencies, with differing maturities at fixed or variable interest rates. Certain of the Bank's borrowings
contain embedded derivatives that are required under IAS 39 to be separated from the host contract and carried
on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is based on market quotations when possible or on discounted cash
flow models using market estimates of cash flows and discount rates. The models use market-sourced inputs
such as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. Selection of these inputs may require
judgement. All financial models used for valuing the Bank's financial instruments are subject to internal and
periodic external reviews.

In compliance with IAS 39, where it has not been possible to reliably measure such embedded derivatives, the combined contracts associated with these borrowings have been carried at fair value on the balance sheet. Other borrowings are carried on the balance sheet at par value (face value) adjusted for unamortized premiums or discounts. The
unamortized balance of the issuance costs are netted off against borrowings in the balance sheet. Borrowing expenses
include the amortization of issuance costs, discounts and premiums, which is determined on an effective yield basis.

The Bank uses derivatives in its borrowing and liability management activities to take advantage of cost savings
opportunities and to lower its funding costs. These instruments include currency swaps and interest rate swaps.
The derivatives are used to modify the interest rate or currency characteristics of the borrowing portfolio and are
linked to the related borrowings at inception and remain so throughout the terms of the contracts. The interest
component of these derivatives is disclosed as borrowing cost over the life of the derivative contract and included
in the income statement. Prior to the adoption of IAS 39, all borrowings-related derivatives were recorded on a
historical cost basis. However, upon adoption of IAS 39 these derivatives are carried at market value on the balance sheet. The Bank uses trade date for recording its borrowing transactions.

Investments

Investment securities are classified based on management's intention on the date of purchase. Securities which
management has the intention and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at

ANNUAL REPORT 2004 163ss) The African Development Bank

amortized cost. Held-to-maturity and trading investments maturing within three months from their date of acquisition are included in liquidity in the Statement of Cash Flows. Investments in the trading portfolio, recorded on
trade date basis, are carried and reported at market values and related unrealized gains and losses are included in
income.

The Bank uses derivative instruments, such as over-the-counter foreign exchange forwards, currency swaps, cross
currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps, in the management of its trading portfolio. These derivatives
are carried at market value and related gains and losses are included in trading income.

Securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements are reported at
market rates. Securities sold under repurchase agreements were outstanding as at end of the year. The Bank
receives securities purchased under resale agreements, monitors the fair value of the securities and if necessary
may require additional collateral.

Fair Value Disclosure

Unless otherwise specified, financial instruments for which market quotations are available have been valued
at the prevailing market value. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have
been valued using methodologies and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments.
Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or
whether they are actually exchangeable is not readily determinable. Management believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable, however, the values actually realized in a sale might be different from the
fair values disclosed.

The methods and assumptions used by the Bank in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Cash: The carrying amount reported in the Balance Sheet is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted
market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Swaps: Fair values for the Bank's interest rate and currency swaps are based on quoted market prices or pricing
models and represent the amounts that the Bank would receive or pay to terminate the agreements based upon
market quotes.

Borrowings: The fair values of the Bank's borrowings are based on quoted market prices, where available or at
par where market prices are not available.

Equity Investments: The underlying assets of the Bank's equity investments carried at fair value are periodically
fair valued both by the fund managers and independent valuation experts using appropriate approaches. Where
such underlying assets represent investments in listed enterprises, fair values are based on the latest available
quoted bid prices. On the other hand, where the underlying assets represent investments in unlisted enterprises,
fair values are assessed using appropriate methods, for example, discounted cash flows. The fair value of the Bank's
investments in these funds is estimated as the Bank's percentage ownership of the net asset value of the Funds.

Derivative Financial Instruments: The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on market
quotations when possible or on discounted cash flow models using market estimates of cash flows and discount
rates. The models use market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option
volatilities. All financial models used for valuing the Bank’s financial instruments are subject to both internal and
periodic external reviews.

164 ANNUAL REPORT 2004The African Development Bank

Loans: ADB currently does not sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The
estimated fair value of loans is calculated as detailed in Note J for the various types of loans .

Post-Retirement Benefits

The Bank maintains a defined benefit pension plan for its employees which provide benefit payments to participants upon retirement. Actuarial gains or losses that arise on post retirement benefits are recognized in the
income statement in accordance with IAS 19. At the beginning of the reporting period, the unrecognized net
actuarial gains or losses are compared with the greater of 10 percent of the present value of the defined benefit
obligation and 10 percent of the plan assets. Any excess is recognized in the income statement as an actuarial
gain or loss over the expected average remaining working lives of the employees participating in the plan.

With effect from January 2003, the Bank revised its Staff Medical Benefit Plan. The revised Plan provides medical
coverage for staff members and their dependants, certain retired staff members, survivors of staff members and
staff on disability. Under the Plan, staff members or retirees contribute a percentage of their salary or pension
toward the financing of the plan. The Bank also contributes twice the total staff contribution toward the medical
plan. A medical benefits plan board, composed of selected officers of the Bank and representatives of retirees
and the staff association, oversees the management and activities of the benefit plan. The contributions from the
Bank, staff and retirees are deposited in a trust account.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting equity that, under International
Financial Reporting Standards, are excluded from net income. For the Bank, comprehensive income comprises
currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains or losses on equity investments carried at fair value and net
income. These items are presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Changes in Reserve.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards requires
management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from such estimates.
Significant judgment has been used in the estimation of fair values of loans, borrowings and equity participation
and in the determination of the accumulated provision for loan losses and equity participations.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications of prior year's amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current
year. These reclassifications did not have an income statement impact.

Restatement of prior year financial statements

During 2003 the Bank issued certain deep-discounted bonds, the proceeds of which were immediately swapped
into other currencies. Interest expense on these borrowings was correctly reported in 2003. However, a total of
UA 20.73 million, representing the amortization of the discount on the swap side of the transaction, was omitted from the calculation of the unrealized net loss/gain on non-trading derivatives (IAS 39 Adjustment) for 2003.
Accordingly, the IAS 39 Adjustment as well as the borrowings amount in the Balance Sheet for 2003 have been
restated to correct such omission. There is no effect in 2004.

Note D - Special Funds

Under Article 8 of the Agreement Establishing the Bank, the Bank may establish or be entrusted with the administration of special funds. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the following funds were held separately from those
of the ordinary capital resources:

1. The Nigeria Trust Fund was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement)
between the African Development Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement stipulates that the
Fund shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from the date of the Agreement and that the resources of the
Fund shall be transferred to Nigeria upon termination. However, the 30-year sunset period may be extended by
mutual agreement between the Bank and Nigeria. The initial capital of this Fund was Naira 50 million payable in
two equal installments of Naira 25 million each, in freely convertible currencies. The first installment, equivalent to
US$ 39.90 million, was received by the Bank on July 14, 1976, and payment of the second installment, equivalent
to US$ 39.61 million, was made on February 1, 1977.

During May 1981, the Federal Republic of Nigeria announced the replenishment of the Fund with Naira 50 million. The first installment of Naira 35 million (US$ 52.29 million) was paid on October 7, 1981. The second installment of Naira 8 million (US$ 10.87 million) was received on May 4, 1984. The payment of the third installment
of Naira 7 million (US$ 7.38 million) was made on September 13, 1985.

The resources of the Nigeria Trust Fund at December 31, 2004 and 2003 are summarized below:

 

(UA thousands) 2004 2003
Contribution received 128,586 128,586

2. The Special Relief Fund (for African countries affected by drought) was established by Board of
Governors’ Resolution 20-74 to assist African countries affected by unpredictable disasters. The purpose of this
fund was subsequently expanded in 1991 to include the provision of assistance, on a grant basis, to research
institutions whose research objectives in specified fields are likely to facilitate the Bank's objective of meeting the
needs of regional member countries in those fields.

The resources of the Fund consist of contributions by the Bank, the African Development Fund and various member states.

ANNUAL REPORT 2004 167ss) The African Development Bank

The summary statement of the resources and assets of the Special Relief Fund (for African countries affected by
drought) as at December 31, 2004 and 2003 follows:

At December 31, 2004, a total of UA 1.77 million (2003: UA 5.22 million) had been committed but not yet
disbursed under the Special Relief Fund.

3. The Staff Retirement Plan (the Plan), a defined benefit plan established under Board of Governors’ Resolution
05-89 of May 30, 1989, became effective on December 31, 1989, following the termination of the Staff Provident
Fund. Every person employed by the Bank on a full-time basis, as defined in the Bank's employment policies, is eligible to participate in the Plan, upon completion of 6 months service without interruption of more than 30 days.

The Plan is administered as a separate fund by a committee of trustees appointed by the Bank on behalf of its
employees. In November 2004, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved certain revisions to the Plan, including simplification of the calculation of the employee contribution rate, more explicit reference to the Bank's
residual responsibility and rights as the Plan sponsor, changes in survivor child benefits and an increase in the
pension accumulation rate from 2 percent to 2.5 percent for each year of service. The past service cost associated with these changes amounted to UA 1.64 million and has been recorded in the current year. Participants of
the Plan as of the December 31, 2004 were given up to April 30, 2005 to make the election on either to remain
in the former Plan or switch to the revised Plan, which is effective January 1, 2005. Staff joining the Bank after
January 1, 2005 can benefit only from the revised Plan. Most participants are expected to switch to the Plan.
Under the revised Plan, employees contribute at a rate of 9 percent of regular salary. The tax factor used in the
previous Plan has been eliminated. The Bank typically contributes twice the employee contribution, but may vary
such contribution based on the results of annual actuarial valuations.

All contributions to the Plan are irrevocable and are held by the Bank separately in a retirement fund to be used
in accordance with the provisions of the Plan. Neither the contributions nor any income thereon shall be used for
or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive benefit of active and retired participants or their beneficiaries or
estates, or to the satisfaction of the Plan’s liabilities. At December 31, 2004, virtually all of the investments of the
Plan were under external management and these were invested in indexed funds, with the following objectives:
a) Equity portfolio — to track as closely as possible, the returns of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World
Index as well as hedging the currency exposure of the Plan's anticipated future liabilities; b) Bond portfolio - to
track as closely as possible, the returns of the Citigroup World Government Bond Index as well as hedge the
currency exposure of the Plan's anticipated future liabilities.

Note E - Trust Funds

The Bank has been entrusted, under Resolutions 11-70, 19-74 and 10-85 of the Board of Governors, with the
administration of the Mamoun Beheiry Fund, the Arab Oil Fund, and the Special Emergency Assistance Fund for
Drought and Famine in Africa. These funds, held separately from those of the ordinary resources of the Bank,
are maintained and accounted for in specific currencies, which are translated into Units of Account at exchange
rates prevailing at the end of the year.

1. The Mamoun Beheiry Fund was established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 11-70 of October 31,
1970, whereby Mr. Mamoun Beheiry, former President of the Bank, agreed to set up a fund which could be used
by the Bank to reward staff members who had demonstrated outstanding performance in fostering the objectives of the Bank.

2. The Arab Oil Fund (contribution of Algeria) was established following Board of Governors’ Resolution 1974 of July 4, 1974. Under a protocol agreement dated November 15, 1974, the Bank received the sum of US$ 20
million from the Government of Algeria to be kept as a Trust Fund from which loans could be granted to member
countries affected by high oil prices. On August 11, 1975, an amount of US$ 5.55 million was refunded to Algeria
upon request, leaving a balance of US$ 14.45 million, from which loans refundable directly to Algeria have been
made. At December 31, 2004, a total of US$ 13.45 million (2003: US$ 13.45 million) had been so repaid.

3. The Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa (SEAF) was established
by the 20th Meeting of Heads of State and Government of member countries of the African Union formerly
Organization of African Unity (OAU) held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from November 12 to 15, 1984, under
Resolution AHG/Res. 133 (XX), with the objective of giving assistance to African member countries affected by
drought and famine.

Note F - Reserves and Net Income Allocations

The total reserves of the Bank comprise General Reserves, net income for the current year to be allocated by the
Board of Governors of the Bank and translation gains or losses. The General Reserve represents retained earnings,
after allocations of net income by the Board of Governors. In addition, the General Reserve includes a transition
adjustment of UA 10.80 million relating to the adoption of IAS 39 on January, 2001. On May 25, 2004, the Board
of Governors of the Bank approved certain allocations of the Bank's net income for 2003. Such allocations are
summarized in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Changes in Reserves.

At December 31, 2004, the total reserves of the Bank included UA 39.90 million (2003: UA 53.64 million) representing income recognized on the restructured loans to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) but not yet
formally allocated to the DRC special account. Under Article 42 of the Agreement establishing the Bank, the
authority for the allocation or distribution of the net income or part thereof of the Bank is vested in the Board
of Governors. Management has proposed for the consideration of the Board of Directors an allocation of the
UA 36.74 million to the DRC Special Account. The decision of the Board of Directors on this proposal will be
considered by the Board of Governors at the Annual General Meeting of the Bank.

Note G - Capital Stock

The Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V) was approved by the Board of Governors of the Bank on May 29,
1998 and became effective on September 30, 1999 upon ratification by member states and entry into force of
the related amendments to the Agreements establishing the Bank. The GCI-V increased the authorized capital
of the Bank by 35 percent from 1.62 million shares to 2.187 million shares with a par value of UA 10,000 per
share. The GCI-V shares, a total of 567,000 shares, are divided into paid-up and callable shares in proportion of
six percent (6 %) paid-up and ninety-four percent (94%) callable. The GCI-V shares were allocated to the regional
and non-regional members such that, when fully subscribed, the regional members shall hold 60 percent of the
total stock of the Bank and non-regional members shall hold the balance of 40 percent.

Prior to the GCI-V, subscribed capital was divided into paid-up capital and callable capital in the proportion of
1 to 7. With the GCI-V, the authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 10.81 percent paid-up shares and
89.19 percent callable shares.

The subscribed capital increased from UA 21.56 billion as at December 31, 2003 to UA 21.60 billion at December
31, 2004.

Total unsubscribed shares at December 31, 2004 amounted to UA 272.11 million, comprising UA 128.45 million for shares to be issued upon payment of future cash installments, UA 104.83 million for shares available for
reallocation, and UA 38.83 million representing the balance shareholding of the former Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia (former Yugoslavia) after allocating UA 9.09 million to treasury shares. Since the former Yugoslavia
has ceased to exist as a state under international law, its shares (composed of UA 41.93 million callable and UA
5.99 million paid-up shares) are currently held as treasury shares of the Bank in accordance with Article 6 (6) of
the Bank Agreement. In 2002, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved the proposal to invite each of the
successor states of the former Yugoslavia to apply for membership in the Bank, though such membership would
be subject to their fulfilling certain conditions including the assumption pro-rata of the contingent liabilities of
the former Yugoslavia to the Bank, as of December 31, 1992. In the event that a successor state declines or
otherwise does not become a member of the Bank, the pro-rata portion of the shares of former Yugoslavia,
which could have been reallocated to such successor state, would be reallocated to other interested non-regional
members of the Bank in accordance with the terms of the Share Transfer Rules. The proceeds of such reallocation will however be transferable to such successor state. Furthermore, pending the response from the successor
states, the Bank may, under its Share Transfer Rules, reallocate the shares of former Yugoslavia to interested

472: ANNUAL REPORT 2004The African Development Bank

non-regional member states and credit the proceeds on a pro-rata basis to the successor states. In 2003, one of
the successor states declined the invitation to apply for membership and instead offered to the Bank, as part of
the state’s Official Development Assistance its pro rata interest in the proceeds of any reallocation of the shares
of former Yugoslavia. The Bank has since accepted the offer.

Prior to the fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), payments on the share capital subscribed by the nonregional member countries were fixed in terms of their national currencies. Under GCI-IV, payments by regional
and non-regional members in US$ have been fixed at an exchange rate of 1 UA = US$ 1.20635. As a result of
these practices, losses or gains could arise from converting these currencies when received to Units of Account.
Such conversion differences are reported in the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions account.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions was made up as follows:

 

(UA thousands) 2004 2003
Balance at 1 January 145,330 141,991
Net conversion losses on new subscriptions 1,873 3,339
Balance at December 31 147,203 145,330

Note H - Non-negotiable Instruments

Prior to May 1981, all payments on paid-up capital had been made in convertible currencies. However, for the
capital increases authorized in May 1979 (but effective December 1982) and May 1981, regional members had
the following two options for making their payments:

a) Five (5) equal annual installments, of which at least 50 percent is payable in convertible currency and the
remainder in the local currency; or

b) five (5) equal annual installments, of which 20 percent is payable in convertible currency and 80 percent in
non-negotiable, non-interest bearing notes. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in installments commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

Non-regional members were required to make their payments solely in convertible currencies.

The paid-up portion of subscriptions, authorized in accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolution in Note G
above (GCI-IV), is to be paid as follows:

a) Regional members - 50 percent in five (5) equal annual installments in cash in freely convertible currency or
freely convertible currencies selected by the member state, and 50 percent by the deposit of five non-negotiable, non-interest bearing notes of equal value denominated in Units of Account. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in five (5) equal annual installments commencing on the fifth
anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

b) Non-regional members - five (5) equal annual installments in their national currencies, where such currencies are freely convertible or in notes denominated in freely convertible currencies encashable on demand.

Under GCI-V, there is no distinction in payment arrangements between regional and non-regional members. Each
member is required to pay for the paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in eight (8) equal and consecutive

ANNUAL REPORT 2004 173ss) The African Development Bank

annual installments. The first installments shall be paid in cash and in a freely convertible currency. The second to
the eighth installments shall be paid in cash or notes encashable on demand in a freely convertible currency.

Note J - Loans

The loans of the Bank are for the purpose of financing development projects and programs and are not intended
for sale. Further, management does not believe that there is a comparable secondary market for the type of loans
made by the Bank. The fair values of loans reported in these financial statements represent management's best
estimates of the present value of the expected cash flows of these loans. The types of loans currently held by the
Bank are described below:

Multi-Currency Fixed Rate Loans: For all loans negotiated prior to July 1, 1990, the Bank charges interest at
fixed rates. Fair values were estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on a discount rate comprising
the fixed rate loan spread plus the year-end estimated cost of funds.

Multi-Currency Variable Rate Loans: Effective from July 1, 1990, the Bank introduced variable rate loans in a
bid to reduce its interest risk. The variable interest is reset twice a year and is based on the Bank’s own cost of
qualified borrowing plus 50 basis points, resulting in a pass-through of average borrowing costs to those lenders
that benefit from the Bank’s loans. The estimated fair value is considered to approximate carrying value, adjusted
for credit risk.

Single Currency Variable Rate Loans: The Bank introduced single currency variable rate loans on October 1,
1997. The lending rate is based on the average cost of the Bank's pool of specific borrowings for each currency
comprising mostly medium- to long-term fixed rate borrowings. It is reset semi-annually and also carries a spread
of 50 basis points. The estimated fair value is considered to approximate carrying value, adjusted for credit
risk.

Single Currency Floating Rate Loans: The Bank introduced LIBOR-based single currency floating rate loans
with effect from October 1, 1997. The lending rate is tied to 6-month LIBOR or (EURIBOR) in the currencies of
the borrower's choice. The lending rate provides a direct pass-through of the Bank's cost of funds, and is reset
annually with a spread of 50 basis points. The estimated fair value is considered to approximate carrying value,
adjusted for credit risk.

Single Currency Fixed Rate Loans: Fixed rate loans were reintroduced with effect from October 1997 in the
form of single currency fixed rate loans. The lending rate is based on the amortizing swap rate, that is, single
fixed rate equivalent of 6-month LIBOR in the loan currency for value on the rate fixing date. It is based on the
Bank's cost of borrowing for funding these loans in the loan currency plus a market risk premium and the Bank's
standard spread of 50 basis points. The estimated fair value of single currency fixed rate loans is considered to
approximate carrying value.

Conversion of Multi-Currency Pool-Based Variable Rate Loans: Borrowers were offered the choice to convert the disbursed and undisbursed amounts of their multi-currency pool-based variable rate to single currency
variable terms or retain the terms of their existing multi-currency pool-based variable rate loans. The conversion
dates were October 1, 1997 and March 1, 1998. The other terms and conditions of converted loans remained
the same as in the original loan agreements. The estimated fair value is considered to approximate carrying value,
adjusted for credit risk.

The Private Sector Loans: These loans are made at market terms and are at variable interest rates and their
carrying values are considered to approximate fair value.

(2003: UA 301.58 million) was overdue, were in non-accrual status. If these loans had not been in non-accrual
status, income from loans for the year ended December 31, 2004 would have been higher by UA 61.30 million
(2003: UA 80.85 million). The cumulative non-accrued income on loans at December 31, 2004 was UA 784.00
million (2003: UA 703.32 million).

178 ANNUAL REPORT 2004The African Development Bank

Effective July 1, 2002, the outstanding balance and accumulated arrears on interest and charges to the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) were restructured into two (2) new consolidated loans. The disbursed and
outstanding balances were consolidated into loan “A”, while the accumulated arrears on interest and charges
were consolidated into a loan “B”. Whilst the consolidation of the interest previously due (loan B) had resulted
in an increase of UA 361.19 million in receivables outstanding and contractually due from the DRC, the balance
sheet exposure to the DRC (loan A) remained unchanged, due to the deferral of the recognition of such interest
and charges which were in non-accrual status prior to the restructuring (loan B). The consolidated loans carry
interest at the rate of 8.97 percent, representing the weighted average interest rate on all the DRC loans prior to
the consolidation. The final maturity of the consolidated loan is 20 years, which includes a 2-year grace period.
The previous loans had final maturities extending to 2010. Although the consolidated DRC loans are contractually
current, they remain in non-accrual status, to allow for a period of satisfactory performance. As at December 31,
2004, the balances outstanding on loans ‘A’ and ‘B’ were UA 343.47 million and UA 417.90 million, respectively.
Income for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes UA 39.90 million (2003: UA 53.64 million) recognized
on a cash-basis on the DRC consolidated loan.

Guarantees

The Bank may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to the borrowers or other parties for
goods and services to be financed under loan agreements. At December 31, 2004, irrevocable reimbursement
guarantees issued by the Bank to commercial banks on undisbursed loans amounted to UA 14.94 million (2003:
UA 9.86 million).

Also, the Bank has provided guarantees for securities issued by an entity eligible for the Banks’ loans. Guarantees
are regarded as outstanding when the borrower incurs the underlying financial obligation and are called when a
guaranteed party demands payment under the guarantee. Outstanding guarantee of loan principal of UA 15.38
million at December 31, 2004, representing the maximum potential risk if the payments guaranteed for the entity
are not made, was not included in reported loan balance.

Loan Hedges
In addition to the swaps on borrowings disclosed in Note N, the Bank has entered into interest rate swaps which
transform fixed rate income on loans in certain currencies into variable rate income. The fair value of interest rate

swaps are included in the Balance Sheet under Accounts Receivable.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003 the carrying and estimated fair values of interest rate swaps on some of the
Bank's loan portfolio were as follows:

 

(UA thousands, 2004 2003
Contract or Estimated Contract or — Estimated
Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value
Interest Rate Swaps 683,834 (19,787) 728,196 (22,783)

Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative

he Bank participates in a multilateral initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as Heavily
ndebted Poor Countries (HIPCs). Under this initiative, creditors provide debt relief for eligible countries that
demonstrate good policy performance over an extended period to bring their debt burdens to sustainable levels.
Under the original framework of HIPC initiatives, selected loans to eligible beneficiary countries were paid off by
he HIPC Trust Fund at a price equivalent to the lower of the net present value of the loans, as calculated using
he methodology agreed under the initiatives, and their nominal values.

Following the signature of a HIPC debt relief agreement, the relevant loans were paid off at the lower of their
net present value or their carrying value. On average, loans in the ADB's portfolio carry higher interest rates than
he present value discount rates applied and therefore the net present value of the loans exceeds the book value.
Consequently, affected ADB loans were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at book values.

he HIPC initiative was enhanced in 1999 to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was
achieved by reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much
earlier than under the original framework. Under the enhanced framework, where 32 African countries are eligible,
he debt relief is delivered through annual debt service reductions; and release of up to 80 percent of annual debt
service obligations as they come due until the total debt relief is provided. In addition, interim financing between
he decision and completion points, of up to 40 percent of total debt relief is provided whenever possible, within a
15-year horizon. At December 31, 2004, the Board of Directors had approved relief for 17 ADB borrowing countries,
of which 8 had reached the completion point. During the year ended December 31, 2004, debt relief of UA 129.48
million (2003: UA 71.69 million) was received on behalf of the ADB borrowing countries.

Note K - Equity Participations
The Bank's participation in the equity of African Development Fund and other institutions was as follows:
African Development Fund

The African Development Fund (ADF or the Fund) was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist
the Bank in contributing to the economic and social development of the Bank's regional members, to promote
cooperation and increased international trade particularly among the Bank’s members, and to provide financing
on concessional terms for such purposes. The Fund's original subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the
original State Participants to the ADF Agreement, and State Participants acceding to the Agreement since the
original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the form of Special
General Increase and General Replenishments.

The ADF has a 12-member Board of Directors, made up of 6 members selected by the African Development Bank
and 6 members selected by State Participants, which reports to the Board of Governors made up of representatives of the State Participants and the ADB. The ADB exercises fifty percent (50%) of the voting powers in ADF
and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

To carry out its functions, the Fund utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank,
for which it pays a management fee. The management fee paid by the Fund to the Bank is calculated annually
on the basis of a cost-sharing formula, approved by the Board of Directors, which is driven in large part by the
number of programs and projects executed during the year. Based on the cost-sharing formula, management
fees incurred by ADF for the year ended December 31, 2004 amounted to UA 103.06 million (2003: UA 101.66
million), representing 69.64 percent (2003: 66.19 percent) of the shareable administrative expenses incurred by
the Bank. The accounts of the ADF are kept separate and distinct from those of the Bank. As at December 31,
2004, the Bank's subscriptions to ADF amounted to UA 111.74 million.

Note M - Administrative Expenses

Total administrative expenses relate to expenses incurred on behalf of the ADF, the NTF and for the operations of
the Bank itself. The ADF and NTF reimburse the Bank for their share of the total administrative expenses, based
on an agreed upon cost-sharing formula, which is driven by certain selected indicators of operational activity
for operational expenses and relative balance sheet sizes for non-operational expenses. However the allocated
expenses to NTF shall not exceed 20 percent of the gross income of NTF. The administrative expenses comprised
the following:

The average number of staff (including short-term staff) included in personnel expenses for 2004 was 1,057.
(2003: 1,192). The number of staff (regular and short-term) at December 31, 2004 was 1,085 (2003: 1,096).

To insulate the Bank from possible significant increases in administrative expenses that could arise from an appreciation of the principal currencies of administrative expenditure i.e. EUR, GBP and USD vis-a-vis the UA, the Bank
executed forward exchange transactions to hedge its administrative expenses. These transactions were entered
into with a zero lock-in cost. The nominal value of the forward transactions as at December 31, 2004 amounted
to UA 65.00 million with an unfavorable market value of UA 0.13 million.

Included in general administrative expenses is an amount of UA 3.18 million (2003: UA 2.47 million) incurred
under operating lease agreements for offices in Tunisia and certain other regional member countries.

At the balance sheet date, the Bank had outstanding commitments under operating leases, which fall due as

 

follows:

(UA thousands) 2004 2003
Within one year 1,778 2,329
In the second to fifth years inclusive 192 1,100
Total 1,970 3,429

Leases are generally negotiated for an average term of one (1) to three (3) years and rentals are fixed for an
average of one (1) year.

Note N - Borrowings

The Bank's borrowing strategy is driven by three major factors, namely: timeliness in meeting cash flow requirements, optimizing asset and liability management with the objective of mitigating exposure to financial risks, and
providing cost effective funding. In addition to long- and medium-term borrowings, the Bank also undertakes
short-term borrowing for cash and liquidity management purposes only.

The Bank has entered into currency swap agreements with major international banks by which proceeds of a
borrowing are converted into a different currency and simultaneously a forward exchange agreement is executed

providing for the future exchange of the two currencies in order to recover the currency converted.

The Bank has also entered into interest rate swaps, which transform a floating rate payment obligation in a
particular currency into a fixed rate payment obligation or vice-versa.

ANNUAL REPORT 2004 187ss) The African Development Bank

The Bank has a potential risk of loss if the swap counterparty fails to perform its obligations. In order to reduce
such credit risk, the Bank only enters into long-term swap transactions with counterparties eligible under the
Bank's Assets and Liability Management Guidelines, which include requirement that the counterparties have a
minimum credit rating of AA-/Aa3. The Bank does not anticipate that any of its counterparties will fail to perform
their obligations under such agreements.

At December 31, 2004, borrowings with embedded callable options amounted to UA 533.96 million
(2003: UA 409.62 million). These options can be exercised annually on interest payments dates from the time the
bond is first callable until its maturity date.

Itis the Bank’s policy to limit senior borrowing and guarantees chargeable to the Bank's ordinary capital resources to
80 percent of the callable capital of its non-borrowing members and also to limit the total borrowing represented by
both senior and subordinated debt to 80 percent of the total callable capital of all its member countries. At December
31, 2004, total borrowing, excluding embedded derivatives, amounted to UA 5,649.89 million comprising senior
debt and subordinated debt amounting to UA 4,948.69 million and UA 701.20 million, respectively. As of the
same date, the ratio of senior debt to the non-borrowing members’ callable capital of UA 8,532.00 million was
58.00 percent. Also at December 31, 2004 the ratio of total outstanding borrowings to the total callable capital of
UA 19,374.63 million was 29.16 percent.

Note P - Liquidity Position

The Bank's liquidity policy ensures that it has the resources to meet its net disbursement and debt service obligations while at the same time allowing the flexibility in deciding the appropriate time to access the capital markets.
The Bank's liquidity policy requires that it holds liquid assets in a target zone, above the required prudential minimum level of liquidity (PML) and less than the operational level of liquidity (OLL). The PML is computed as the
sum of the debt service payment for the next year, the projected net loan disbursement for the next year, the loan
equivalent value of signed guarantees and the undisbursed equity investments. As an operational guideline, the
OLL is computed as the prudential minimum level of liquidity (PML) plus 50 percent of the stock of undisbursed
loans. The table below provides an analysis of assets, liabilities and members’ equity into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to contractual maturity date. It is presented
under the most prudent consideration of maturity dates where options or repayment patterns allow for early
repayment possibilities. Therefore, in the case of liabilities, the earliest possible repayment date is shown, while
for assets, it is the latest possible repayment date. Assets and liabilities that do not have a contractual maturity
date are grouped together in the “Maturity undefined” category.

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest
rates. The length of time for which the rate of interest is fixed on a financial instrument indicates to what extent
it is exposed to interest rate risk. The table below provides information on the extent of the Bank’s interest rate
exposure based either on the contractual maturity date of its financial instruments or, in the case of instruments
that reprice to a market rate of interest before maturity, the next repricing date. Securities that comprise the
Bank's dealing portfolio are assumed to reprice within the “Up to and including 1 year” category

NNUAL REPORT 2004

Note R - Financial Risks

In the normal course of its development banking business, the Bank may be exposed to the following types of
financial risk:

Country Credit Risk: Country credit risk includes potential losses arising from a country’s inability or willingness
to service its obligations to the Bank. The Bank manages country credit risk through financial policies and lending
strategies, including individual country exposure limits and overall creditworthiness assessments. These include
the assessment of the country’s macroeconomic performance as well as its socio-political conditions and future
growth prospects. Potential losses from country credit risk are considered in the determination of the accumulated provision for loan losses.

Commercial Credit Risk: In the ordinary course of business, the Bank uses a variety of financial instruments,
some of which involve elements of commercial credit risk in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet.
Commercial credit risk exposure represents the maximum potential accounting loss due to possible nonperformance by counterparties under the terms of the contracts. Additionally, the nature of the instruments involve contract value and notional principal amounts that are not reflected in the basic financial statements. For securities,
the Bank limits trading to a list of authorized dealers and counterparties with the highest credit ratings. Credit
risk is controlled through application of eligibility criteria and limits for transactions with individual counterparties,
based on their credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 10 percent of the Bank’s total risk capital for any
single counterparty. The Bank may require collateral in the form of cash or other approved liquid securities from
individual counterparties in order to mitigate its credit exposure.

Market Risks: Market risks encompass funding, liquidity, currency and interest, and exchange rate risks. Such
risks are managed through the pricing of loans and the Bank's overall asset and liability management practices.
The Bank's liquidity policy ensures that it has the resources to meet its net disbursement and debt service obligations and allow it flexibility in deciding the appropriate time to access the capital market. To achieve this objective,
the Bank operates on a prudential minimum as well as an operational level of liquidity established by this policy.
The prudential minimum level of liquidity is based on the debt service payment of the next year, the projected
net loan disbursement for the next year, the loan equivalent value of signed guarantees and the undisbursed
equity investments. All potential debt service payments due to early redemption of swaps and borrowings with
embedded options are included in the determination of the debt service payment of the next year. To enable the
Bank to take advantage of low-cost funding opportunities as they arise, the Bank's policy allows it to build up
liquid resources above the prudential minimum level. The maximum level of liquidity is limited to the total of the
minimum plus 50% of the stock of undisbursed loans. The Bank maintains interest rate limits for each internally
managed or externally managed active currency portfolio. The borrowing cost pass-through formulation incorporated in the lending rates charged on the Bank's recent loans, has helped to limit the interest rate sensitivity
of the net spread earnings on its loan portfolio. The Bank holds or lends the proceeds of its borrowings in the
same currencies borrowed (after swap activities). Also, to avoid currency mismatches, borrowers are required to
service their loans in the currencies disbursed by the Bank. Furthermore, in order to minimize exchange rate risks,
the Bank matches its borrowing obligations in any one currency (after swap activities) with assets in the same
currency. The Bank also offers loans with interest rates directly linked to market interest rates. For such marketbased loan products, the Bank's net margin is preserved by using swaps to align the interest rate sensitivity of the
loans with that of the Bank's underlying funding (6-month LIBOR floating rate).

Note S - Grants

The Bank administers grants on behalf of donors, including member countries, agencies and other entities.
Grant resources are restricted for specific uses, which include the co-financing of the Bank's lending projects,
debt reduction operations, technical assistance for borrowers including feasibility studies and project preparation, global and regional programs and research and training programs. These funds are placed in trust and are
not included in the assets of the Bank. In accordance with Article 11 of the Agreement establishing the Bank,
the accounts of these grants are kept separate from those of the Bank. The undisbursed balances of the grant
resources at December 31, 2004 and 2003 comprised the following:

Note T - Segment Reporting

Other than the private sector lending operations, which at December 31, 2004 accounted for about 6 percent of
the lending operations of the Bank and therefore considered to be insignificant to make a meaningful segment
reporting, Management believes that the Bank has only one reportable segment, because it does not manage its
operations by allocating resources based on a determination of the contribution to net income from individual
borrowers. With regards to loans made to, or guaranteed by member countries, given the nature of the Bank,
the risk and return profiles are sufficiently similar among borrowers that the Bank does not differentiate between

powers of the Bank are vested in the Board of Governors, which consists of the Governor appointed by each
member of the Bank, who exercises the voting power of the appointing member country. Member country
subscriptions and voting powers are disclosed in Notes W and X. The Board of Directors, which is constituted by
eighteen (18) Directors elected by the member countries, is responsible for the conduct of the general operations
of the Bank, and for this purpose, exercises all the powers delegated to it by the Board of Governors. The Bank

The GCL-IV refers to the fourth capital increase. Shares are issued only upon payment of cash installments or deposit of notes. The difference between the Paid-up shares

and the Paid-in shares corresponds to the shares to be issued on payment of subsequent installments. (The ratio of the Paid-up to the Callable Capital is 1:7).

The GCL-V refers to the fifth capital increase. Shares are issued only upon payment of cash installments or deposit of demand notes. The difference between the Paid-up shares
and the Paid-in shares corresponds to the shares to be issued on payment of subsequent installments. (The ratio of the Paid-up to the Callable Capital is 1:15 2/3).

“Total Shares” gives the sum of Pre-GCI-IV total shares subscribed and that of GCI-IV shares subscribed.

In accordance with the decision of the Board of Directors of April 3, 2002, the shares held by the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) have been transferred to
the Bank, consistent with Article 6(6) of the Bank Agreement, and are considered Treasury Shares. In this connection, and as directed by the Board of Directors, the Bank initiated
discussions with the successor states of SFRY, to determine whether they would be interested in becoming members of the Bank. The Republic of Slovenia (which is one of the
successor states) has advised that it would not be considering membership in the Bank, and has therefore offered the Bank, as part of its Official Development Assistance (ODA),
the value of its pro rata interest in the shares of SFRY. Accordingly, 909 shares held by SFRY, corresponding to Slovenia’s pro rata interest in such shares, will be offered for
re-allocation under the Share Transfer Rules.

Slight differences may occur in totals due to rounding.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

We have audited the financial statements of the African Development Bank (the Bank) for the year
ended 31 December 2004 which comprise the Balance Sheet, the Statement of Income and Expenses,
the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Changes in Reserves, the Statement of Cash Flows and
the related Notes A to X. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies
set out therein, for the purpose of submitting approved and audited financial statements to the Board of
Governors as required by Article 32(d) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank.

This report is made solely to the Bank’s Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Article 32(d)
of the Agreement Establishing the Bank. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to
the Bank’s Board of Governors those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the Bank and its Board of Governors as a body, for our audit work, for this report,
or for the opinions we have formed.

Respective responsibilities of management and auditors

The Bank’s management is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards.

Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing.

Basis of audit opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those Standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes assessing the
accounting policies used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Bank as at 31 December 2004 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then
ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

The African Development Fund (ADF) window is the concessional lending arm of the Bank Group for the 38 RMCs
that are unable to borrow at market rates under the ADB
window. The 2 blend countries (Nigeria and Zimbabwe)
are also entitled to the concessional borrowing from the
ADE. The window provides funding in the form of highly
concessional loans and grants to low-income RMCs for
investment in basic economic and human development
projects. Allocation of resources is fundamentally based
on several criteria, which include country creditworthiness, per capita GNP, and country performance. ADF
resources are made available to the 38 Category A
countries (countries deemed not creditworthy enough
for non-concessional borrowings and corresponding to
IDA-only countries) and 2 Category B countries (eligible
for blend financing). In accordance with established rules,
the allocation of resources for planned operations in ADF
borrowing countries must reflect each country's policy
and institutional performance, as well as its record in
terms of project implementation. The resources of the
ADF are designed to accelerate a broad-based, equitable,
and sustainable economic growth as well as promote

social development, with a special focus on poverty
reduction.

Total approvals from the ADF window amounted in 2004
to UA 1.26 billion for 99 operations in 27 countries and
18 multinational projects (UA 217.7 million), as compared
to 112 operations in 25 countries and 16 multinational
projects amounting to UA 998.0 million in 2003. The 26
percent increase in ADF allocations is due to the pursuit
of full operations under this window following the conclusion of the consultations for the Ninth Replenishment
of the Fund (ADF-IX) in September 2002, with the year
2004 representing the third and final year of the ADF-IX
funding cycle. The resources mobilized under ADF-IX are
expected to be fully utilized by the end of 2004. In this
regard, ADF donors completed the consultations in midDecember 2004 on the Tenth Replenishment of the Fund
(ADF-X), which will be covering the Fund's operations
throughout the 2005-2007 period.

Project loans represented more than one-third of ADF
approvals in 2004, accounting for 38.7 percent of the
total. The loans went to 28 operations totaling UA 487.2
million. In 2004 the Fund also provided financing for 7

Approved in October 1999, the Rice Rehabilitation Project
was aimed primarily at reducing poverty and promoting food
security in the Lower Mangoky area of southern Madagascar.
The project's specific objective is to develop and increase rice
production in the area by rehabilitating hydro-agricultural
infrastructure and feeder roads. The project focuses on rehabilitation of irrigation facilities, support to perimeter upgrading,
and project management. The project’s total cost amounted to
UA 17.0 million and was financed by ADF for UA 10.0 million,
while the remainder was covered by the OPEC Fund and the
Government for UA 3.1 million and UA 1.1 million respectively.
The project was approved by the ADF in October 1999.

The project has made a positive impact on the target rural
communities. The good results achieved by farmers are
noteworthy, since the average yield has reached 4 tons per
hectare. During an agricultural contest held in 2003, the
Lower Mangoky farmers were awarded the 1st and 3rd prize
for best producer in the country, with an astounding yield of
12,700 tons per hectare. Also, before the start of the project,
women seldom owned production plots. Adding to the scarcity

 

Rice Rehabilitation Project in Lower Mangoky, Madagascar

of plots, women suffered from specific problems that kept
them from fully participating in the development of the perimeter. The project will contribute to lift constraints and foster
women's access to credit and land property.

With the upgrading of nearly 8,400 ha, the project has favorably impacted on the livelihood of between 500 and 600
families. Additional production, expected to reach 35,580
tons of paddy rice a year, will contribute to food security and
increase the farmers’ incomes. Thanks to a new rural financing
scheme, farmers now have access to credit to meet their needs
in the areas of storage, processing, and trading of agricultural
products. The promotion of income-generating activities and
crop diversification (maize, manioc, and peas) is also helping
farmers to secure their income generation capacities. The
securing of land tenure for peasants is underway within a partnership with the Department of Domains and Land services.
As a result, 4,804 plots have already been delineated, out of
the 4,519 ha to be used to that end, and 3,850 land contracts
have been attributed to beneficiaries, including women.

debt and debt service reduction which represented the
second largest share of ADF approval with an amount of
UA 342.7 million representing 27.2 percent of the total.
The 5 operations were all geared toward HIPC debt
relief and 2 post-conflict debt relief grants (UA 41.3
million). Grants constituted the third largest approvals
of ADF resources, with some 54 operations accounting
for 17.0 percent of total approvals (UA 213.9 million),
of which 33 operations were for technical assistance
(UA 100.0 million) and 21 operations related to project
grants (UA 113.9 million). Policy-based lending targeted
10 operations representing 17.0 percent of the total
approvals and amounting to UA 214.2 million. This
amount funded 9 structural adjustment loans for UA
211.7 million and 1 sector adjustment loan for UA 2.5
million.

A new feature of Fund operations in 2004 was the significant increase in the debt and debt service reduction
instrument, which disbursed UA 301.4 million.

sector, transportation, and multisector activities, all of
which impact significantly on economic growth and the
livelihood of poor people, contributing consequently
to poverty reduction. These 4 sectors accounted for 88
percent of total ADF sector lending in 2004.

The continued focus on agriculture and rural development and the social sector as the main target of Bank
intervention reflects the importance of these sectors
in the drive to improve output growth and raise living
standards, thus contributing significantly to reducing
poverty and social alienation in the recipient RMCs.
Ten operations, amounting to UA 198.2 million and
representing 28.3 percent of total loan approvals, were
allocated to the agriculture and rural development sector. These operations were mainly aimed at promoting
broad-based rural growth, strengthening food security,
enhancing agricultural productivity of poor rural households, improving production techniques, and strengthening linkages between research, extension, farmers
and private business. They also aim at expanding stakeholder participation and access to basic services. The
social sectors, including health and education, which
are critical to poverty reduction and to addressing basic
needs, were allocated UA 77.9 million (11.1 percent of
the total ADF approvals for 2004), to help finance 7
operations.The Fund earmarked more loan resources to the multisector activities in 2004 because of their great impact on
economic reforms. The multisector which comprises, inter
alia, support activities in favor of public sector management, including structural adjustment programs and debt
relief operations, private sector development, and good
governance and institutional support, is vital for consolidating institutional and economic reforms in RMCs. In this
regard, the multisector was allocated UA 221.5 million in
loan approvals (31.6 percent of total loan approvals), to
fund 10 operations. This is to ensure that growth is broadbased and equitably distributed in eligible RMCs and that
economic and social development becomes sustainable.

Infrastructure development, which includes power supply, transportation, and water supply and sanitation,

and maintenance, in the drive to reduce poverty and
strengthen the access of the rural poor to farm and
industrial production areas.

Policy-based Lending

In 2004 some 10 policy-based loans amounting to UA
214.2 million, and representing 17.0 percent of total
loan, were approved to support 9 structural adjustment
programs totaling some UA 211.7 million and 1 sector
adjustment operation amounting to UA 2.5 million.

GRANT-FINANCED OPERATIONS

Grant financing has increased considerably under ADF-IX,
being part of the effort to address the special challenges
facing low-income Fund countries. ADF grants represented almost one-third of the total amount allocated as
loans. Besides technical assistance and capacity-building
initiatives, grant resources are being used to fund priority activities such as HIV/AIDS interventions; post-conflict
reconstruction and natural disaster prevention; education
and health; water and sanitation; environmental protection; as well as technical assistance and capacity-building
support for agriculture.

Total ADF grant approvals in 2004 increased substantially
to reach UA 213.9 million for 54 operations, compared to
UA 170.9 million in 2003 and an annual average of UA
170 million over the past 3 years.

Eleven grants amounting to UA 47.4 million were
approved for multisector activities to support growth
acceleration and institutional strengthening in recipient
RMCs, and the remaining grants went to support the
newly established project grant operations eligible for
grant financing under ADF-IX Guidelines.

In 2004, 22 countries benefited from grant financing
amounting to UA 143.0 million, while the remaining UA
70.9 million (33.1 percent of the total) was approved
for multinational projects and programs in support of
regional economic cooperation and integration; private
sector development, good governance, and institutional
support.

Grants Financed by Sector in 2004

Consonant with the Fund's strategy to curb poverty and
promote broad-based growth, grant operations in 2004
focused on the priority sectors of agriculture and rural
development, the social sector, and water supply and
sanitation, as well as on the multisector. The social sector
comprising education and health projects accounted for
the largest share (36.4 percent) for 18 operations. The
multisector accounted for the second largest share (22.2
percent) with 11 operations, while agriculture and rural
development ranked third with 20.7 percent of total ADF
grants for 12 operations. Infrastructure attracted UA
42.7 million, of which UA 27.9 million (13 percent) was
allocated to 6 projects to improve water supply and sanitation facilities, particularly in rural areas, while 1 grant
amounting to UA 1.7 million was directed to support
environmental studies and programs.FIGURE 7.3

Grant Financing for Technical Assistance

Project grant financing for technical assistance is an
important instrument to assist RMCs in designing, developing, and implementing development projects and
programs and to strengthen national institutions and
regional agencies. In 2004 a total of 33 grants amounting to UA 100.0 million were approved for this category,
of which 10 grants totaling UA 22.2 million went to
fund project-cycle activities and 23 grants amounting to
UA 77.7 million were allocated to institutional support,
including private sector development.

Project Grant Financing

Grant financing was an innovative step taken in 2003
under the ADF-IX Guidelines to support activities in priority areas such as HIV/AIDS interventions, post-conflict
reconstruction, investments in education, health and
water supply and sanitation, and natural disaster reconstruction. In 2004, 21 project grants were approved for a
total amount of UA 113.9 million.

Post-Conflict Debt Relief Grant

In 2004 the ADF contributed a total of UA 55 million
to the Post-conflict Countries Facility. During the year 2
countries were allocated grants, totaling UA 41.3 million
from this facility.

HIPC Debt Relief

The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative was
set up to reduce poor RMCs’ indebtedness, bring it to
sustainable levels, and direct debt service savings toward
poverty reduction activities. Resources made available
under HIPC are devoted to finance key pro-poor growth
programs that are listed in the recipient countries’ PRSPs.
In 2004, 5 operations amounting to UA 301.4 million
were approved within this framework.

ADF-X are scheduled to start in 2005.

Investments

ADF cash and investments amounted to UA 1.54 billion
at December 31, 2004, compared to UA 1.30 billion
in 2003. Investment income for the year amounted to
UA 48.2 million, a return of 3.2 percent, on an average
investment of UA 1.53 billion compared to an income of
UA 23.6 million in 2003 for a return of 1.8 percent on an
average investment of UA 1.29 billion.

Loan Portfolio

Cumulative loans and grants signed, net of cancellations,
at December 31, 2004, amounted to UA 12.16 billion,
compared with UA 11.48 billion at end of 2003. At the
end of 2004, there were 1,873 active signed loans and

FINANCIAL RESULTS

The ADF reported a surplus of UA 0.9 million for 2004,
compared to a loss of UA 26.2 million for 2003. Income
from investment more than doubled in 2004, increasing from UA 23.6 million in 2003 to UA 48.2 million in
2004, due mainly to the change in the Fund's investment
policy during 2004, which included investment in higher
yielding held-to-maturity securities. Income from loans
increased by 18.9 percent from UA 53.9 million in 2003
to UA 64.1 million in 2004 due primarily to the exit from
non-accrual status of a borrower and an increase in the

The African Development Fund

average balance of disbursed and outstanding loans.
Administrative expenses, which represent the Fund's
share of the total shareable expenses of the ADB Group,
increased by UA 1.4 million from UA 101.7 million in
2003 to UA 103.1 million in 2004. The Fund's proportion
of the total shareable expense of the ADB group is based
on a predetermined cost-sharing formula, which is driven
primarily by the relative levels of certain operational volume indicators.

According to the Fund's non-accrual policy, service
charges on loans made to, or guaranteed by a regional
member country are excluded from loan income if principal repayment and service charges are in arrears for 6
months or more. As a result of this policy, an amount of
UA 0.4 million representing net non-accrued loan income
for the year was excluded from 2004 income compared
to an amount of UA 6.7 million of non-accrued income
in 2003.

NOTES TO THE SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003

Note A - Purpose, Organization and Resources
Purpose and Organization

The African Development Fund (ADF or the Fund) was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist
the African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) in contributing to the economic and social development of the
Bank's regional members, promote cooperation and increased international trade, particularly among the Bank's
members, and to provide financing on concessional terms for such purposes.

The ADF has a 12-member Board of Directors, made up of six (6) members selected by the Bank and six (6)
members selected by State Participants. The Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors, which is made
up of representatives of the State Participants and the ADB. The ADB exercises fifty percent (50%) of the voting
powers in ADF and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

The ADB, the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund administered by the ADB and the ADF are collectively referred to as the Bank Group. The assets and liabilities of the ADB and of the NTF are separate and
independent of those of the ADF. Furthermore, the ADF is not liable for their respective obligations. Transactions
with these affiliates are disclosed in the notes that follow. The principal purpose of ADB is to promote economic
and social development in its regional member countries. The ADB finances development projects and programs
in its regional member states. The ADB also participates in the selection, study and preparation of projects conributing to the development of its member countries and where necessary provides technical assistance. The NTF
was established under an Agreement between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria to further support
he development efforts of ADB regional member countries, particularly the lesser-developed countries.

Resources

he resources of the Fund consist of subscriptions by the Bank, subscriptions by State Participants, other resources
received by the Fund and funds derived from operations or otherwise accruing to the Fund. The initial resources
of the Fund consisted of subscriptions by the Bank and the original State Participants to the ADF Agreement.
hereafter, the resources have been replenished through Special and General Increases of subscriptions.

Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Due to the nature and organization of the Fund, these special purpose financial statements have been prepared
or the specific purpose of reflecting the Net Development Resources of the Fund and are not intended to be
a presentation in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. These special purpose financial
statements have been prepared to comply with Articles 35(1) and (2) of the Agreement Establishing the Fund,
which requires that the Fund circulates, at appropriate intervals, a summary of its financial position and income
and expenditure statement showing the results of its operations.

 

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Fund's financial statements are as follows:
Monetary Basis of Special Purpose Financial Statements

The special purpose financial statements are expressed in Units of Account. Article 1 of the Agreement Establishing
the Fund (the Agreement) defined a Unit of Account as having a value of 0.81851265 gram of fine gold.

262 ANNUAL REPORT 2004The African Development Fund

On April 1, 1978, when the second amendment to the Articles of the Agreement of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) came into effect, gold was abolished as a common denominator of the international monetary system.
Computations relating to the currencies of IMF members were from that date made on the basis of the Special
Drawing Right (SDR) for purposes of applying the provisions of the Articles of the IMF. The Fund's Unit of Account
was therefore based on its relationship to the SDR at the time of establishment of the Fund. This was 1 Unit of
Account equal to SDR 0.921052.

Subsequently, on November 16, 1992, the Board of Governors decided by Resolution F/BG/92/10 to redefine
the Fund's Unit of Account to be equivalent to the Unit of Account of the African Development Bank (the Bank)
which is for the time being defined as equivalent to the Special Drawing Right of the IMF. In compliance with
this Resolution, the Board of Directors on June 22, 1993, adopted January 1, 1993, as the date for the entry into
effect of the Resolution, and the Fund's Unit of Account has since then been defined as equal to the Bank's Unit
of Account.

The Fund conducts its operations in the currencies of its State Participants. Income and expenses are converted
into Units of Account at the rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities are translated
into Units of Account at rates prevailing at the Statement of Net Development Resources date. Translation differences are debited or credited to the Cumulative Currency Translation Adjustment. Translation gains and losses on
subscriptions received are credited or debited to the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions. Where
currencies are converted into any other currency, the resulting gains or losses are included in income.

The rates used for translating currencies into Units of Account at December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows:

2004 2003
1 Unit of Account equals:
Argentinian Peso 4.595360 4.308620
Brazilian Real 4.121060 4.292080
Canadian Dollar 1.869200 1.920470
Danish Krone 8.462960 8.820990
Euro 1.140160 1.176540
Indian Rupee 67.680100 67.775000
Japanese Yen 161.161000 158.575000
Korean Won 1,608.290000 1,/79.890000
Kuwaiti Dinar 0.456488 0.437915
Norwegian Krone 9.377960 9.918860
Pound Sterling 0.804085 0.832619

Swiss Franc 1.757380 1.838000
United States Dollar 1.553010 1.485970

No representation is made that any currency held by the Fund can be or could be converted into any other currency at the crossrates resulting from the rates indicated above.

ANNUAL REPORT 2004 263es) The African Development Fund Be

Participants' Subscriptions

Subscriptions committed by State Participants for each replenishment are recorded in full as subscriptions receivable from participants, upon submission of an instrument of subscription by the participants.
A replenishment becomes effective when ADF receives instruments of subscriptions from participants
for a portion of the intended replenishment level as specified in the Replenishment Resolution. The portion of subscribed amounts for which payments are not yet due from State Participants, are recorded as
installments on subscriptions not yet payable, and are not included in the Net Development Resources
of the Fund. The subscriptions not yet payable become due throughout the replenishment period (generally 3 years) in accordance with an agreed payment schedule. The actual payment of subscriptions
when they become due from certain members is conditional upon the respective member's budgetary
appropriation process.

The subscriptions receivable are settled through payment of cash or deposit of non-negotiable, non-interest
bearing demand notes. The notes are encashed by the Fund as provided in an encashment program agreed
to at the time of the replenishment.

For the ADF IX replenishment, participants were given the option of an early payment of cash in an amount
equivalent to the net present value of their entire subscription and contribution. Upon receipt of such cash
payments, participants are credited with the full face value of their entire subscriptions, and in agreement
with the Fund, such cash amounts received are invested and the income generated thereon is retained
by the Fund. A discount, calculated as the difference between the face value of the subscriptions and the
cash amount received, is initially recorded to represent the interest expected to be earned to the credit of
the state participant. Such discount is amortized over the projected encashment period, to recognize the
effective contributions to capital by the relevant participant over and above the initial cash advanced.

Maintenance of Value of Currency Holdings

Prior to the second general replenishment, subscriptions were denominated in Units of Account and were
subject to Article 13 of the Agreement which provided that, whenever the par value in the IMF of the currency of a State Participant is reduced in terms of the Unit of Account or its foreign exchange value has, in
the opinion of the Fund depreciated to a significant extent within that participant's territory, that participant
shall pay to the Fund within a reasonable time an amount of its currency required to maintain the value,
as of the time of subscription, of the amount of such currency paid into the Fund by that participant and
which has not been disbursed or exchanged for another currency.

Conversely, if the currency of a State Participant has increased in par value or appreciated in its foreign
exchange value within that participant's territory, the Fund shall return to that participant an amount of
such currency equal to the increase in the value of the Fund's holding of that currency which was received
by it in payment of subscriptions, to the extent that these amounts have not been disbursed or exchanged
for another currency.

In accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolutions 9-78, 9-82, 4-84, 01-88, 91-05, 96-04, 99-09 and
2002-09 which all stipulated that Article 13 shall not apply to the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,
Seventh, Eighth and Ninth General Replenishments, subscribers to these replenishments fixed the amount
of their subscriptions payable in national currencies in terms of agreed parities ruling at the date these
replenishments came into force. Gains or losses arising on translating these subscriptions, when received
into the Fund's Unit of Account, are applied against subscriptions, with the offsetting debits or credits to
the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions.

264 ANNUAL REPORT 2004The African Development Fund

Investments

The Fund's investment securities are classified based on management's intention on the date of purchase.
Securities which management has the intention and ability to hold until maturity are classified as heldto-maturity and reported at amortized cost. All other investment securities are carried at market value.
Government and agency obligations include marketable bonds or notes and other government obligations
issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member countries or other official entities with a
minimum credit rating of AA-. For asset-backed securities, the Fund may only invest in securities with AAA
credit rating. Money market instruments include time deposits, certificates of deposit and other obligations
with maturity period of less than a year, issued or unconditionally guaranteed by banks and other financial
institutions with a minimum rating of A.

Income from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses and interest earned.

Investments maturing within 3 months from the date of acquisition are also included in liquidity in the
statement of cash flows. Investments in the trading portfolio are carried and reported at market values
and related unrealized gains and losses are included in income. Income from investments includes realized
and unrealized gains and losses on trading financial instruments, and the amortization of premiums and
discounts calculated on the constant yield basis for the held-to-maturity financial instruments.

Loans

The Fund provides concessional funding for development purposes to the least developed countries in
Africa. Outstanding loans are not included in Net Development Resources, and, accordingly, no provision
for possible loan losses is required. The Fund places all loans to a borrower country in non-accrual status
if the principal installments or service charges on any of the loans to such member country are overdue by
6 months or more, unless the Fund’s management determines that the overdue amount will be collected
in the immediate future. Further, management may place a loan in non-accrual status even if it is not yet
overdue by 6 months, if the specific facts and circumstances, including consideration of events occurring
subsequent to the balance sheet date warrant such action. On the date a borrower's loans are placed in
non-accrual status, charges that had been accrued on loans to the borrower, which remained unpaid, are
deducted from the income from loans of the current period. Charges on loans in non-accrual status are
included in income only to the extent that payment has been received by the Fund.

The Fund participates in a multilateral initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified
as Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) to help ensure that the reform efforts are not compromised by
unsustainable external debt burdens. Under this initiative, creditors provide debt relief for those countries
that demonstrated good policy performance over an extended period to bring their debt burdens to sustainable levels. As a part of this process, the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund, (the Trust Fund) constituted
by funds from donors, including the Bank Group, was established to help beneficiaries reduce their overall
debt, including those debts owing to the Fund.

Under the original framework of the initiative, upon signature of a HIPC Debt Relief Agreement between
the Fund, the beneficiary country and the Trust Fund, loans or repayment installments identified for sale to
the Trust Fund are written down to their estimated net present value. On the settlement date, the estimated
write-down is adjusted to reflect the actual difference between the cash received and the carrying value
of the loans sold.

ANNUAL REPORT 2004 265es) The African Development Fund Be

Under the enhanced framework, implementation mechanism comprises partial payment of ADF debt service as
it falls due with funds received from the Trust Fund.

Restricted Funds

Pursuant to the Board of Directors’ Resolution F/BD/2000/02, concerning the introduction of replenishment-specific encashments for the Fund, the Government of Canada agreed with the Fund on a customised encashment
schedule to meet its remaining payment obligations under the Sixth, Seventh and Eight General Replenishments.
The arrangement called for three scheduled payments, which together with income earned, would be applied
by the Fund against the obligations as they fell due. In 2004, at the request of the Government of Canada, this
arrangement was terminated and the remaining funds, held in a restricted account, were used to offset part of
Canada’s obligations to ADF under the above subscriptions’ replenishments. Consequently, there was no balance
outstanding under this agreement at December 31, 2004 (2003: UA 83.79 million).

Note D - Demand Obligations

These obligations represent subscription payments made by participants, in accordance with Article 9 of the
Agreement, in the form of non-negotiable non-interest bearing notes payable at their par value on demand. The
Board of Governors has agreed that the encashment of these notes will be governed by the Fund's disbursement
requirements.

Note E - Development Activities

According to the Fund's loan regulations, loans are expressed in Units of Account and repaid in the currency
disbursed.

Project Loans and Lines of Credit

Loans are generally granted under conditions that allow for repayment between 40 and 50 years, after a 10-year
grace period commencing from the date of the loan agreement. Loan principal is repayable from the eleventh to
the twentieth year at a rate of 1 percent per annum and thereafter at a rate of 3 percent per annum. A service
charge at a rate of 0.75 percent per annum on the principal amount disbursed and outstanding is payable by the
borrower semi-annually. Loans approved after June 1996 carry a 0.5 percent per annum commitment charge on
the undisbursed portion. Such commitment charge commences to accrue after 90 days from the date of signature of the loan agreement.

Prior to the establishment of the Technical Assistance Account, loans for pre-investment studies were normally

granted for a period of 10 years, including a grace period of 3 years, with repayments in equal installments over
7 years.

ANNUAL REPORT 2004 267es) The African Development Fund Be

Of the undisbursed balances of loans signed, the Fund may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay
amounts to borrowers or others in respect of the cost of goods and services to be financed under loan agreements. As at December 31, 2004, outstanding irrevocable reimbursement guarantees to commercial banks
amounted to UA 2.41 million (2003: UA 2.70 million).

As at December 31, 2004, loans made to or guaranteed by certain borrowers with an aggregate principal balance
outstanding of UA 843.01 million (2003: UA 962.60 million) of which UA 67.04 million (2003: UA 67.89 million)
was overdue, were in non-accrual status. If these loans had not been in non-accrual status, income from loans
for the year ended December 31, 2004, would have been higher by UA 5.33 million (2003: UA 6.67 million). At
December 31, 2004, the cumulative charges not recognized on the non-accrual loans amounted to UA 38.86
million, compared to UA 38.81 million at December 31, 2003.

Lines of credit to national development banks and similar national finance institutions are generally granted for
a maximum of 20 years, including a 5-year grace period. The service charge rate on utilized lines of credit is the
same as for project loans.

Grants and Technical Assistance Activities

Under the Fund's lending policy, 5.00 percent of the resources available under the Third and Fourth General
Replenishments, 10.00 percent under the Fifth and Sixth General Replenishments, 7.50 percent under the
Seventh and Eighth General Replenishments have been allocated as grant funds to provide technical assistance
for the identification and preparation of development projects or programs in specified member countries. In
addition, amounts in the range of 18 to 21 percent of the total resources under the Ninth Replenishment were
set aside in the form of grants for permitted uses, including technical assistance and project financing. Under the
Eighth and Ninth General Replenishments, technical assistance may be provided on a reimbursable basis.

Technical Assistance loans are granted under conditions that allow for repayment in 50 years, including a 10-year
grace period, from the date of the loan agreement. However, the following categories of loans have different
terms:

i) where the loan is granted for the preparation of a pre-investment study and the study proves that the project
is not possible, the grace period is extended to 45 years with a repayment period of 5 years thereafter.

ii) where the loan is granted for strengthening regional member countries’ co-operation or for the improvement
of the operations of existing institutions and is not related to specific projects or programs, the grace period
is 45 years with a repayment period of 5 years thereafter.

 

Technical Assistance loans do not carry charges.
HIPC Initiative

Under the original framework of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, selected loans to beneficiary countries are paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price equivalent to the net present value (NPV) of the loans
as calculated using the methodology agreed under the initiative. Following the signature of a HIPC debt relief
agreement, loans identified to be paid off are written down to their estimated net present value. The amount of
this write-down, representing the difference between the book value and net present value of the loans, is shown
as a reduction in Sources of Development Resources.

268 ANNUAL REPORT 2004The African Development Fund

At December 31, 2004, the cumulative position of loans sold to the HIPC Trust Fund relates to loans to
Mozambique with outstanding balance of UA 132.04 million sold under the original framework for a net present
value of UA 60.96 million. The difference of UA 71.08 million was applied as a reduction to net development
resources.

In 1999, the HIPC initiative was enhanced to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This
was achieved by reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief
much earlier than under the original framework. Under the enhanced framework, where 32 African countries
are currently eligible, debt relief is delivered through annual debt service reductions which allow the release of
up to 80 percent of annual debt service obligations as they come due until the total net present value (NPV) of
debt relief, determined by the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) is provided. Interim financing of up to 40 percent
of total debt relief is granted between the decision and completion points. During the year ended December 31,
2004, the HIPC Trust Fund provided debt service relief of UA 66.47 million to ADF eligible beneficiary countries.

Special Arrears Clearance Mechanism

In connection with an internationally coordinated effort between the ADB Group, the IMF, the World Bank and
other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstruction
efforts, the Board of Directors on June 26, 2002 approved an arrears clearance mechanism for the DRC. Under
the arrears clearance mechanism, representatives of ADF State Participants (the Deputies) authorized an allocation of approximately UA 36.50 million of grant resources from the ninth replenishment of the ADF (ADF-IX) to
clear the entire stock of the DRC’s arrears to the Fund. The Deputies also authorized the use of approximately
UA 11.77 million of the residual Supplementary Financing Mechanism (SFM) resources from ADF Vill as a partial
payment against the DRC’s arrears on charges to the ADB.

Note F - Subscriptions

he Fund's initial subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement,
and states acceding to the Agreement since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were
received from participants in the form of a special general increase and nine general replenishments. Details of
hese movements are shown in the statement of subscriptions and voting power.

he ninth general replenishment, approved by the Board of Governors resolution F/BG/2002/09 adopted on
December 16, 2002, came into effect on January 30, 2003, when State Participants deposited with the Fund,
instruments of subscription representing an aggregate amount of 31.94 percent of the total intended subscripion.

Gains or losses arising from translation of subscriptions received into Units of Account are recorded in the cumulaive exchange adjustment on subscriptions account.

Note G - Other Resources

n conformity with the findings of the UN General Assembly, the Board of Directors accepted that the former
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia no longer exists as a state under the international law and hence no
longer a state participant in the Fund or a member of the Bank. Pursuant to a decision of the Board of Directors
of the Fund in 1993, the subscriptions of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the Fund, less the
unpaid portion (UA 12.97 million), are deemed to have become part of the permanent patrimony of the Fund
and are not returnable to any entity. Accordingly, the amounts of the paid subscriptions are reported in these
inancial statements as Other Resources.

 

 

ANNUAL REPORT 2004 269a) The African Development Fund Be

Also included in Other Resources is a total of UA 77.00 million representing the contributions by the Bank of UA
75.00 million, and by the Government of Botswana of UA 2.00 million towards the Fund's activities, in accordance with Article 8 of the Fund’s Agreement. The contributions by the Bank included UA 15.00 million allocated
from the Bank's 2002 net income to mitigate the negative impact on the commitment capacity of the Fund, of
the cost relating to the temporary relocation of the operations of the Bank Group to Tunisia.

Note H - Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Investments: Since the Fund carries its investments held for trading at market value, the carrying amount represents the fair value of the portfolio. Fair values are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted
market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans: All loans of the Fund are intended to provide concessional assistance to low income regional member
countries of the Bank. While the principal amount is fully repayable, no interest is charged to the borrowers.
However, a service fee of 0.75 percent of the disbursed and outstanding balance, and a commitment charge of
0.5 percent on the undisbursed balance are charged to cover the cost of administering the loans. Due to the
highly concessional nature of these loans, it is not meaningful to calculate fair values for outstanding loans.

Balance at January 1 75,588 101,797
Surplus/(Loss) for the year 940 (26,209)
Balance at December 31 76,528 75,588

Note J - Trust Funds

In accordance with the agreement establishing the Fund, the Fund has available resources arising from contributions entrusted to it under Article 8, which empowers the Fund to receive other resources including grants from
State Participants, non-participating countries, and from any public or private body or bodies.

At December 31, 2004 the undisbursed balance of trust fund resources amounted to UA 3.85 million (2003: UA
4.15 million) representing the balance on grant received from Japan for the Development of Human resources
in Africa.

Resources of the trust funds are kept separate from those of ADF.
Note K - Administrative Expenses

Pursuant to Article 31 of the Agreement, the Fund reimburses the African Development Bank for the fair value
of its use of the latter's offices, staff, organization, services and facilities. The amount reimbursed, referred to as
Administrative Expenses, is based on a predetermined cost-sharing formula, which is driven in large part by the
Fund's relative share of the number of programs and projects executed during the period by the Bank Group. The
Administrative Expenses incurred by the Fund for the year amounted to UA 103.06 million (2003: UA 101.66
million).

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FUND

We have audited the accompanying special purpose financial statements of the African Development
Fund (the Fund) for the year ended 31 December 2004 which comprise the Statement of Net
Development Resources, Statement of Income and Expenses and other Changes in Development
Resources, Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Statement of Cash Flows and the related Notes
Ato N. These special purpose financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies
set out therein, for the purpose of submitting approved and audited financial statements to the Board of
Governors as required by Article 26 (v) of the Agreement Establishing the Fund.

This report is made solely to the Fund’s Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Article 26
(v) of the Agreement Establishing the Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the Fund’s Board of Governors those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Fund and its Board of Governors as a body, for our audit work,
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Respective responsibilities of management and auditors

The Fund’s management is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance
with the accounting policies set out in Note B.

Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing.

Basis of audit opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those Standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes assessing the
accounting policies used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the net development
resources of the African Development Fund as at 31 December 2004 and the income and expenses and
other changes in development resources and comprehensive income and its cash flows for the year then
ended and have been prepared in accordance with the basis of accounting policies set out in Note B.

The operations of the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) focus on
assisting development efforts in RMCs, particularly in lowincome countries. In 2003, an agreement was reached
with the Nigerian government on a revised protocol for the
NTF. As part of this agreement, the Federal Government
of Nigeria authorized the reduction of the fixed rate of 4
percent for NTF loans to a lower range of 2 to 4 percent,
to be applied on the basis of operational guidelines to be
developed in consultation with the Nigerian Government.
The new terms of the NTF Agreement also permit the allocation of 10 percent of the annual net income of the NTF
as a contribution to the HIPC Trust. This compares highly
favorably to the ADF, which contributes only 5 percent of
its net income to the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. This protocol is intended to strengthen the operational effectiveness
of NTF as an instrument for economic and social development in Africa. However, operations through that window
fell sharply in 2004 to UA 9.3 million compared to a 2003
high of UA 22.5 million.

As part of the new financing agreement, the Government
of Nigeria authorized the Board of Directors to appropri

ate the sum of US$ 25 million from the corpus of the
NTF to finance activities under the Technical Cooperation
Agreement with Nigeria. It also directed that the disbursements of these funds be done in tranches, taking
into consideration the viability of the NTF window, its
operational commitments as well as the immediate needs
under the Technical Cooperation Agreement.

The approved amount was exclusively devoted to fund
activities in the agriculture sector and rural development
in Gambia and Mauritania. The 2 countries received,
respectively, UA 5.0 million and UA 4.3 million. The
operation in Mauritania was cofinanced with resources
from the ADF and from the Islamic Development Bank.

Cumulative Loan Approvals, 1976-2004

Since its inception in 1976, the NTF has approved a total
of UA 304.6 million for 71 projects in 30 RMCs. Of this
total, UA 14.1 million has been directed into multinational projects.

A review of sector distribution shows that the transportation sector was the main beneficiary of NTF cumulative
loan approvals with UA 98.9 million (32.5 percent),
followed by agriculture and rural development, UA 57.3
million (18.8 percent), the social sector, UA 55.6 million
(18.3 percent), communication, UA 28.1 million (9.2
percent), the finance sector, UA 17.6 million (5.8 percent), water supply and sanitation, UA 17.2 million (5.6
percent), and industry, mining and quarrying, UA 16.3
million (5.4 percent).

In terms of regional distribution, the largest share of NTF
cumulative loan approvals for the period 1976-2004
went to West Africa (39.2 percent), followed by East
Africa (24.5 percent), Southern Africa (17.5 percent),
Central Africa (10.8 percent), and North Africa (3.4
percent). NTF resources were also used to finance multinational projects, which accounted for 4.6 percent of the
NTF cumulative approvals during the same period.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Investments

NTF cash and investments, which are solely denominated in US Dollars, amounted to UA 309.1 million at
December 31, 2004, compared to UA 318.4 million in
2003. Investment income for 2004 amounted to UA 5.6
million, representing a return of 1.7 percent, on an average investment level of UA 328.5 million.

A recent amendment of the NTF Agreement has removed
the limitation on investments of uncommitted NTF
resources to short-term securities. This has enabled the
adoption of a dual portfolio management approach for
the NTF resources whereby 25 percent of the liquidity is

ee

managed against a rolling average of the 3-month US$
LIBOR, while the remaining 75 percent of the liquidity is
invested as a held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolio maturing
on the statutory sunset date.

Loan Portfolio

Loans signed, net of cancellations, as at December 31,
2004, amounted to UA 242.1 million compared with
UA 246.5 million at end of 2003, a decrease of 1.8 percent. As at end 2004, there were 46 active signed loans
amounting to UA 70.0 million. There were 23 fully repaid
loans for a total amount of UA 57.7 million.

Disbursements

Disbursements doubled in 2004, increasing from
UA 2.4 million in 2003 to UA 4.8 million in 2004. As at
December 31, 2004, cumulative disbursements amounted to UA 207.7 million. A total of 54 loans were fully
disbursed for a total amount of UA 172.2 million, representing 82.9 percent of cumulative disbursements.

FINANCIAL RESULTS

The NTF earned a net income of UA 6.0 million in 2004,
compared to UA 11.6 million in 2003. The net income
for 2003 included a net write-back of loan loss provision of UA 6.5 million. Interest and charges on loans
remained unchanged at UA 2.1 million in 2003 and 2004.
Investment income increased from UA 4.3 million in 2003
to UA 5.6 million in 2004, due to a change in the investment strategy of NTF in 2004. Administrative expenses,
which represent the Fund's share of the total shareable
expenses of the ADB Group, increased by UA 0.2 million
from UA 1.3 million in 2003 to UA 1.5 million in 2004.‘sueah g si aloud ay} yO UOZOY ay] ‘saueDjeuag pue ]UALWUAADD

294 ANNUAL REPORT 2004The Nigeria Trust Fund

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003

Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The Nigeria Trust Fund (the Fund) was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the
Agreement) between the African Development Bank (the Bank or ADB) and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The
purpose of the Fund is to assist in the development efforts of the poorer ADB regional member countries. The
Agreement stipulates that the Fund shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from the date of the Agreement
and that the resources of the Fund shall be transferred to Nigeria upon termination. However, the 30-year sunset
period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Bank and Nigeria.

The financial statements of the Fund are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board. The significant accounting policies of the Fund
are summarized below.

Monetary Basis of Financial Statements

The Fund conducts its operations in United States Dollars. In accordance with Article Vil, section 7.3, of the
Agreement Establishing the Nigeria Trust Fund, the financial statements are presented in Units of Account (UA).
The value of the UA is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank as equivalent to one
Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose
by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). At December 31, 2004, 1 UA was equivalent to 1.55301 United States
dollars (2003: 1.48597 United States dollars).

Translation of Currencies

Income and expenses are converted into UA at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities are translated into UA at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The resulting
translation gains and losses are reported as Cumulative Currency Translation Adjustments. Where currencies are
converted into any other currency, the resulting gain or loss is included in the determination of net income.

Revenue recognition

Interest income is accrued based on the terms of the related financial instrument and for the time that such
instrument is outstanding and held by the Fund using the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate
that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial asset to the asset's net
carrying amount. Income from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading financial
instruments and the amortization of premiums and discounts calculated on the constant yield basis for the heldto-maturity financial instruments.

Investments

The Fund's trading investments are primarily in government and other obligations and are carried at market
value. Government and other obligations include marketable bonds, notes and other obligations. For government
and agency obligations, the Fund may only invest in obligations with a minimum credit rating of AA — issued or
unconditionally guaranteed by governments of ADB member countries or other official entities. For asset-backed
securities, the Fund may only invest in securities with AAA credit rating. Time deposits include certificates of
deposits and other obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by banks and other financial institutions,
and are carried at amortized cost.

ANNUAL REPORT 2004 295— The Nigeria Trust Fund

Investment securities are recorded on trade date basis and are classified based on management's intention on the
date of purchase. Securities which management has the intention and ability to hold until maturity are classified
as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. All other investment securities held in a trading portfolio are
carried and reported at market value and related unrealized gains and losses are included in income. Investments
including those held to maturity, maturing within 3 months from the date of acquisition are classified as an element of liquidity in the Statement of Cash Flows.

Loans

It is the policy of the Fund to place in non-accrual status all loans to borrowers if the principal installments, interest
or other charges related to such loans, are overdue by 6 months or more, unless the Fund’s management determines that the overdue amount will be collected in the immediate future. Interest and other charges on loans in
non-accrual status are included in income only to the extent that payment has been received by the Fund. When
a loan is placed in non-accrual status, all related unpaid interests and related charges are reversed against current
income. In general, loans are returned to accrual status immediately after the related arrears have been cleared.
However, certain loans that have become current may continue to be carried in non-accrual status until after a
period of satisfactory performance.

Prior to 2003, the policy of the Fund was to provide for loan losses where the repayment would not have been in
accordance with the contractual terms and consequently in arrears for a period of 2 years or more. During 2003
this policy was reviewed and aligned to that of the Bank. The current policy requires accumulated provision for
loan losses to be determined based on an assessment of the collectibility risk of the disbursed and outstanding
loan portfolio.

Fair Value

Fair value is the amount at which an asset could be exchanged or a liability settled between knowledgeable,
willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.

Unless otherwise specified, financial instruments for which market quotations are available have been valued
at the prevailing market value. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have
been valued using methodologies and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments.
Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or
whether they are actually exchangeable is not readily determinable. Management believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable; however, the values actually realizable in a sale might be different from the
fair values disclosed.

The methods and assumptions used by the Fund in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Cash: The carrying amount reported in the Balance Sheet for cash approximates fair values.

Investments: Fair values of investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted
market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans: The Fund does not sell its loans, nor does it believe that there is a comparable market for its loans. Fair
values for loans are determined using a discounted cash flow model based on a discount rate comprising the fixed
rate loan spread plus the year-end estimated cost of funds based on the experience of the African Development
Bank. NTF does not borrow in the capital markets.

296 » ANNUAL REPORT 2004The Nigeria Trust Fund

Derivatives: On January 1, 2001, the Fund adopted International Accounting Standard 39 (IAS 39), “Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”. IAS 39 requires that all derivatives be measured at fair value and
reported on the balance sheet. Except for the held-to-maturity investments, which are reported at amortized cost,
as stated above, all other securities in the Fund's investment portfolio are carried at fair value.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards requires
management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from such estimates.

Reclassification

Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year's presentation.

balance. With effect from September 22, 2003, pursuant to the Board of Governors’ resolution B/BG/2003/11
of June 3, 2003 and the protocol agreement between the Government of Nigeria and the Bank, dated
September 22, 2003, interest rate on loans was changed from a flat four percent (4%) per annum to a range of
2 percent to 4 percent (inclusive) per annum on the outstanding balance. Further, a 0.75 percent commission is
payable on undisbursed balances commencing 120 days after the effective date of the loan. Loans are granted
for a maximum period of 25 years including grace periods of up to 5 years.

The Fund's loan regulations require that loans be expressed in UA and repaid in the currency disbursed. At
December 31, 2004 all the Fund's loans were disbursed and repayable in US Dollars.

298 ANNUAL REPORT 2004The Nigeria Trust Fund

At December 31, 2004 loans made to or guaranteed by certain regional member countries of the ADB, with an
aggregate principal balance outstanding of UA 28.38 million (2003: UA 30.11 million) of which UA 14.39 million
(2003: UA 13.61 million) was overdue, were in non-accrual status. If these loans had not been in non-accrual
status, income from loans for the year ended December 31, 2004 would have been higher by UA 1.12 million
(2003: UA 1.24 million). The cumulative amount of non-accrued income on loans at December 31, 2004 was
UA 14.87 million (2003: UA 14.41 million).

Note D - Fund Capital

The initial capital of the Fund was Naira 50 million which was payable in two equal installments of Naira 25 milion each, in freely convertible currencies. The first installment equivalent to US$ 39.9 million was received by the
Bank on July 14, 1976, and payment of the second installment equivalent to US$ 39.61 million was received on
February 1, 1977.

During May 1981, the Federal Republic of Nigeria announced the replenishment of the Fund with Naira 50 milion. The first installment of Naira 35 million (US$ 52.29 million) was received on October 7, 1981. The second
installment of Naira 8 million equivalent to US$ 10.87 million was received on May 4, 1984. The payment of the
hird installment of Naira 7 million equivalent to US$ 7.38 million was received on September 13, 1985.

Note E - Financial Risks
n the course of its business, the Fund is exposed to the following types of financial risks:

Country credit risk: Country credit risk includes potential losses arising from a country’s inability or unwillingness
0 service its obligations to the Fund. The Fund manages country credit risk through its credit policy, including a
sanctions policy that contains cross default clauses. Potential losses from country credit risk are considered in the
determination of the accumulated provision on loan losses. Such consideration of country credit risk has resulted
in the accumulated provision for loan losses of 24.01 percent on the Fund's loans on December 31, 2004.

 

Counterparty Credit Risk: In the course of managing its investments, the Fund is exposed to trading counterparty and investment counterparty risk. Counterparty risk is managed by restricting trading to an eligible list
of authorized dealers and counterparties with the highest credit ratings. Furthermore, exposure to any single
counterparty is restricted by the application of a limit based on the counterparty’s size and credit rating, subject
to a maximum of the 10 percent of the Fund's total liquidity.

Market Risks: Market risks comprise currency, interest rate and liquidity risks. Currency risk is mitigated by the
Fund's policy of holding all its investments, as well as loans, in US Dollars. In order to mitigate liquidity risk, the
Fund's investment management policy ensures that it has sufficient liquid assets to meet its disbursement obligations. Interest rate risk on the Fund's loans is minimal as the loans are contractually fixed rate. Interest rate risk
arising out of the variability in investment interest income is mitigated by holding a core component of investments, not required for immediate disbursements, in longer duration investments.

ANNUAL REPORT 2004 299— The Nigeria Trust Fund Se

Note F - Administrative Expenses

According to the Agreement Establishing the Fund, the Fund shall pay to the Bank the expenses incurred in the
management of the Fund as follows:

a) Separately identifiable costs incurred by the Bank for the Fund.
b) Indirect costs incurred by the Bank in the management of the Fund.

However, the annual payment for the aforementioned expenses of the Bank shall not exceed the total of 20%
of the gross income of the Fund during the course of each year.

The formula set out in these sections may be reviewed from time to time by mutual agreement. The amount of
UA 1.53 million charged for the year (2003: UA 1.27 million) represents the expenses reimbursed by the Fund.

Note G - Related Party Transaction

The Nigeria Trust Fund is administered by the African Development Bank. The ADB conducts the general operations of the NTF on the basis of the terms of the NTF Agreement and in consultation with the Government of
Nigeria. The NTF utilizes the offices, staff, organisation, services and facilities of the Bank and reimburses the Bank
for its share of the costs of such facilities, based on an agreed-upon cost-sharing formula. NTF administrative
expenses (Note F) comprise, primarily, such reimbursements made to the Bank during the year.

* Origin of Supply (OOS) for Bank Group procurement and disbursenment purposes means the country from which the goods/services supplied originated as evidenced by the
contract for procurement, and by the summary statement of items which accompanies the invoice or contract supporting an application for withdrawal. For example, a French car
purchased from a local dealer in Cote d'Ivoire would be classified under the code for France.

** The nature of these disbursements makes it impossible to attribute them to any specific supplying or originating country until expenditures have been reported to the Bank.
However, these disbursements will be integrated into the reported country shares as soon as the relevant invoices are received and processed.

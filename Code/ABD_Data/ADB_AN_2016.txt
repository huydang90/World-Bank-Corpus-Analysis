Decades

0O050 YEARS OF ADB:
IMPROVING
ree FORThe Asian Development
Bank (ADB) was created
50 years ago through the
collective wishes and
collaborative efforts of
governments across Asia
and the Pacific, and from
other countries around
the world. The Bank’s
purpose was clear from
the beginning: to foster
economic growth and
regional cooperation.

 

Because ADB’s founders wanted our organization to be
truly multilateral, they encouraged developed nations in
North America and Europe to become members. Held on
19 December 1966 in Manila, ADB’s opening ceremony
celebrated the union of 31 members, with 19 from Asia
and the Pacific and 12 from other continents. Today, our
membership has more than doubled to 67, including 48
members from Asia and the Pacific.

In the mid-1960s, food was in short supply across
poverty-stricken Asia and the region lacked access to
development finance. ADB’s focus therefore was on
technical assistance and loans to agriculture. Half a

ADB AR 2016

 

century later, the region’s economic growth and success
in reducing poverty have exceeded even the most
optimistic forecasts.

But we cannot be complacent. The fact remains that
there are still 330 million people living in absolute poverty
across Asia and the Pacific. A lack of infrastructure
continues to limit economic growth, inhibit poverty
reduction, and restrict improvements to quality of life.

Implementing the Sustainable Development Goals and
the climate change actions agreed at the 21st Conference
of Parties on Climate Change are also priorities for our
region. The private sector needs to be further developed.
Gender equality needs strengthening at every level. The
challenges of urbanization, aging, and public health must
be addressed.

This 5oth edition of the ADB annual report provides

a fascinating insight into the history of the region and
ADB’s contribution to it. The report gives a strong
account of where ADB now stands as an institution, and
I’m pleased with our progress.

The combination of Asian Development Fund (ADF)
lending operations and ordinary capital resources (OCR)
took effect on 1 January 2017. OCR equity almost tripled,
from $17.3 billion to $48.1 billion, as $30.8 billion of ADFloans and other assets were transferred from the ADF. Assets
amounting to $2.5 billion remained in the ADF to support its grant
operations. The newly enlarged OCR window will offer the poorer
borrowing countries concessional lending on the same terms

and conditions as before, while the ADF itself will provide only
grant assistance going forward. This reform is expected to raise
ADB annual loan and grant approvals by a targeted 50%—from
$13.5 billion in 2014 to $20 billion in 2020 (see Special Appendix).

The effects of the combination became evident even before it
became effective. In 2016, ADB approved loans and grants to

our developing member countries totaling a record $17.47 billion,
compared to $15.99 billion in 2015. Disbursements also scaled

new heights, rising to $12.26 billion. Our private sector operations
amounted to more than $2.5 billion for the second year running.
On the back of strong partnerships with various development
stakeholders, we also mobilized cofinancing worth $14.06 billion—
another record. These results pushed our total operations for 2016
to $31.70 billion, the highest in ADB history.

In May 2016, we also completed a strong replenishment of the
ADF 12 for the period 2017-2020. The contributions from our
donors will enable a doubling of the minimum allocation for small
countries, strengthened support for disaster risk management, and
enhanced regional health security.

 

The increase in our development financing to Asia and the
Pacific reflects our strong commitment to improving the lives

of the region’s people. As ADB celebrates 50 years of providing
development assistance, we will strive even harder to meet the
changing needs of our developing member countries. In the

next 50 years, we should strengthen work in three broad areas of
achievement: providing a combination of finance and knowledge
for developing countries, promoting good policies, and expanding
programs of regional cooperation.

ADB AR 2016

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The Board of Directors provides strategic
direction to ADB; approves policies, loans,
and grants; and ensures that shareholder
guidance is implemented. In 2016, the Board
held 43 formal meetings and 49 informal
sessions. It approved $17.64 billion in loans,
grants, equity investments, guarantees, and
technical assistance projects. It endorsed new
country partnership strategies for Bangladesh,
the People’s Republic of China, Indonesia,
Tajikistan, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam. It also
endorsed the Pacific Approach 2016-2020, a
strategic framework that serves as the overall
country partnership strategy for the 11 smallest
Pacific island countries.

MAJOR POLICY INITIATIVES

In 2015, to make more development assistance
available to countries most in need, the

Board of Directors endorsed the proposal to
merge the lending operations of the Asian
Development Fund (ADF) with ADB’s
ordinary capital resources (OCR). To prepare
for this merger, the Board in 2016 approved
amendments to financial policies on ADF
grant operations and OCR operations. The
amendments to the OCR financial policies
sought to optimize the financial management
of the consolidated balance sheet and provide

 

wider currency choices for recipients of
concessional loans.

The Board approved changes to ADB’s main
crisis lending instrument, the Countercyclical
Support Facility. The move refined the facility’s
access criteria, while strengthening Board
consultation, enhancing coordination with
other multilateral organizations, and clarifying
the difference between crisis lending and
policy-based lending. The Board supported the
revision of the concessional assistance policy,
which consolidated the performance-based
allocation policy and the ADF grant framework.
To complete the alignment of policies with

the ADF-OCR merger, ADB reviewed its
investment strategy and authority, broadening
its scope to include reputable international
credit rating agencies and consider socially
responsible investing.

The Board provided guidance in the ongoing
review of ADB’s capital adequacy framework
and proposed reforms to strengthen the staff
retirement plan. It approved revisions to ADB’s
Anticorruption Policy, particularly to promote
tax integrity and reduce tax avoidance. The
revised policy provides increased support for
developing member countries (DMCs) to
mobilize domestic resources, and encouragesthe inclusion of tax integrity issues in ADB policy
dialogue with DMCs, especially when developing
country partnership strategies.

During informal sessions, the Board also considered
organizational resilience, local currency funding of
ADB loans, procurement reforms, the operational plan
on regional cooperation and integration, and updates
to the review of the ADB Trade Finance Program.

COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD

In 2016, six committees supported the Board: Audit,
Budget Review, Compliance Review, Development
Effectiveness, Ethics, and Human Resources.

The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed updates
on business continuity, disaster risk management, and
anticorruption and integrity. The Compliance Review
Committee noted the implementation of remedial
actions on three cases filed before the Compliance
Review Panel. In 2016, the Human Resources Committee
discussed the implementation of reforms in recruiting
and optimizing staff, managing positions, developing
leaders, and promoting diversity and inclusion in the
workplace. The committee also discussed ADB staff
pension and medical plans.

The Budget Review Committee held extensive budget
consultations in light of the scaling up of operations
during the first year of the ADF-OCR merger in 2017.

It also considered budgetary priorities for organizational
resilience and information technology reform.

The Development Effectiveness Committee reviewed
independent evaluations on ADB’s partnerships,
environmentally sustainable growth, private sector
operations, engagement with middle-income countries,
safeguard implementation in selected countries, and
country operations in Sri Lanka.

PARTNERSHIP AND KNOWLEDGE
EXCHANGE

The Board puts a premium on exchanging knowledge
with ADB members and other development partners.
When ADB governors, alternate governors, and other
eminent persons visit the ADB headquarters, the Board
may convene an informal forum to discuss global and
regional developments that might influence ADB
operations.

During 2016, the Board hosted informal sessions with,
among others, the secretary general of the Pacific Islands
Forum Secretariat, the ADB governor for Germany,

and the presidents of the New Development Bank

and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. These
sessions provided opportunities for the Board to engage

 

in dialogue with ADB partners about Pacific regional
programming, technical and vocational education and
training initiatives, future partnerships, and cofinancing
opportunities.

To fully appreciate the development needs of the region,
small groups of Board members undertake group visits
to selected DMCs. These visits allow Board members

to observe ADB operations and engage in dialogue

with government officials, bilateral and multilateral

aid agencies, civil society organizations, private sector
partners, and project beneficiaries.

In March, Board members visited Timor-Leste and
held high-level discussions with various stakeholders
regarding the country’s prospects for economic
diversification. The group also discussed ADB support
for transport infrastructure, human capital investment,
and municipal services. In June, Board members visited
Georgia and Armenia. They witnessed ADB’s role

in improving roads, basic urban services, renewable
energy, the sustainability of infrastructure investments,
and disaster resilience in the two countries. In late
October and early November, Board members visited
Tonga and Nauru to see first-hand ADB projects for
climate-proofing school buildings and power lines,
establishing broadband connectivity, and supporting port
development.

 

BOARD VISITS NAURU

In November, a small group of ADB directors
visited Nauru to congratulate the government
on the establishment of its sovereign wealth
fund, an initiative that was supported by ADB
technical assistance. Meeting with the President
of Nauru, Baron Waga (pictured, center), the
country’s minister of finance, and representatives
of other development partners, participating
Board members gained a better appreciation of
the unique development challenges faced by
microstates such as Nauru.FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

IMPROVING

LIVES FOR
A BETTER
FUTURE

 

Over the past 50 years, the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has worked to transform Asia and the Pacific from a region
that was once engulfed by debilitating poverty and hunger.
Today, the countries of the region account for one-third of
global gross domestic product and contribute more than
half of the world’s economic growth. The emergence of
Asia and the Pacific as an economic force has raised living
standards in dramatic fashion for many countries.

ADB has been privileged to serve its developing member
countries (DMCs). In partnership with its members,

ADB has mobilized $267 billion in loans and grants to

build infrastructure (for transport, energy, ICT and water
and other urban infrastructure and services), support
agricultural development, particularly in the early years

of ADB operations, provide education, improve health
outcomes, stimulate business, combat climate change,
attract investment, and strengthen regional cooperation and
economic integration in Asia and the Pacific.

The region is, however, still confronted by significant
challenges and, even as the organization marks half a
century of providing assistance, ADB has a lot of work to do.

Among myriad development issues, the region faces the
difficulties brought by rapid urbanization, the threat of
climate change, and growing demand for water and energy.
Poverty and inequality remain widespread. There are still
330 million people, or around 9% of the population of

Asia and the Pacific, surviving on less than $1.90 a day, the
threshold of extreme poverty. Another 1.2 billion people
live on less than $3.10 a day, a poverty line more typical

of low- and middle-income countries. In addition, the
commitments made under the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) and the global climate agreement, adopted in

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) opens for
business on 19 December 1966. Headquartered
in the Philippine capital of Manila, ADB begins
operations with 31 members, $1 billion in capital,
and 40 staff.

MEETING FUTURE
CHALLENGES TODAY

In 2016, to meet increasing

demand from its DMCs, ADB’s
total approved operations reached
an all-time high of $31.70 billion
($17.47 billion for sovereign and
nonsovereign operations from ADB
resources, $169 million for technical
assistance, and $14.06 billion from
various cofinancing partners). Of
the $31.70 billion, ADB committed
$26.59 billion as financing operations
that have been approved and then
signed by the counterparty or
borrower during 2016. This record
lending reflects the scaling up

of operations that has occurred
since the decision in April 2015

to merge ADB’s Asian Development
Fund (ADF) lending operations
with its ordinary capital resources
(OCR) balance sheet. The merger,
effective from January 20717, will
increase ADB’s financing capacity
to $20 billion by 2020.

In May, ADB welcomed the
agreement by donors during the
uth ADF replenishment (ADF 12),
to pledge $3.3 billion for 2017-2020.
Through the fund, ADB will, over
the next 4 years, increase grant
support to its poorest DMCs by 70%

compared with levels provided in
2013-2016. ADF12 will allow ADB to
double the minimum allocation for
small countries, provide grant and
concessional resources to support
further disaster risk reduction, and
offer greater assistance in regional
health security.

In 2016, ADB continued to develop
anew corporate strategy that,
when completed, will guide ADB’s
engagement with DMCs until 2030.
The strategy is expected to define
how ADB operations will align with
the SDGs approved in September
2015 and the new global climate
agreement confirmed in Paris

in December 2015. The strategy

is expected to propose ways to
strengthen ADB’s interaction with
middle-income countries as well
as deepen support to countries

in fragile and conflict-affected
situations. Throughout 2016, ADB
consulted extensively with various
stakeholders—governments,

the private sector, development
partners, and its own management
and staff—on developing the

new strategy.

STRATEGIC FOCUS
MAINTAINED

Under its current long-term strategic
framework, ADB continues to
promote three complementary

 

development agendas: inclusive
growth, environmental sustainability,
and regional cooperation and
integration.

Inclusive growth not only
generates more diverse economic
opportunities and improved

social services, but also allows a
broader cross-section of society

to access, and benefit from, those
opportunities and services. In 2016,
ADB fostered inclusive economic
growth through a variety of countrybased and regional initiatives. This
included support for infrastructure
development (particularly in lagging
areas), education, health, and social
protection. In the Philippines, ADB
approved $400 million of additional
inancing for a project to support
social protection and provide more
conditional cash transfers to around
4.4 million of the country’s poorest
amilies. In Myanmar, ADB approved
a $98.5 million education loan to
help disadvantaged youth participate
in new economic opportunities,
including targeted skills training for
41,000 young people and education
workers. To address population
aging, ADB approved technical
assistance to support care for elderly
people in Indonesia, Mongolia,

Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tonga, and

Viet Nam. In April, ADB approved
an action plan to promote inclusive
business in Asia and the Pacific.10

ADB again contributed to
environmental sustainability
with the approval of 81 projects
worth $10.75 billion to support
sustainable infrastructure

and natural capital, improve
environmental governance, and
address climate change. ADB
remains focused on climate change
as one of its strategic priorities,

and is on track to meet its target

of investing $6 billion annually in
climate change projects by 2020. In
2016, ADB approved $4.44 billion
(including $700.64 million in external
resources) for climate finance, the
highest level since tracking of climate
finance began 6 years ago. ADB
directed $3.25 billion to mitigate
climate change and $1.19 billion for
adaptation. ADB supports the use of
advanced technologies to promote
energy efficiency and minimize
environmental impacts. In Viet Nam,
it supported metro rail projects

in Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City,
providing cleaner, more efficient, and
better integrated urban transport.

     

ADB backed bus rapid transit
projects for cities in the People’s
Republic of China (PRC), the

Lao People’s Democratic Republic
(Lao PDR), and Mongolia. Through
these projects, ADB is helping to
deliver quality infrastructure that is
environmentally friendly, with clean
vehicles, automated fare systems,
intelligent transport systems, and
energy-efficient street lighting.

In 2016, ADB approved $5.4 billion
in projects supporting regional
cooperation and integration.
ADB finance allowed work to
commence on the 500-kilovolt
electricity transmission line
between Afghanistan’s power
import hubs, Pule Khumri and
Kabul, with a transmission capacity
of 1,000 megawatts. This will

enable year-round energy supply

Turkmenistan to Kabul and other
major load centers in southern and

In August, ADB published the
Asian Water Development Outlook
2016, which assessed 29 of 48
countries in the region as being
water insecure. Responding to the
pressing issues of water scarcity
and climate variability, ADB has
led pioneering work on employing

In 2016, ADB approved assistance of
$770.8 million to support education.
This includes investments directly
targeting the education sector as
well as education components of
multisector projects. ADB supported
skills training projects to respond to
labor market needs in Bangladesh,
Cambodia, and the Lao PDR, and
made its first-ever education loan
for skills training in Myanmar. It

also helped fund higher education
projects in the Pacific region and the
Lao PDR, as well as school reform
projects in Nepal and Viet Nam.
These investments are estimated to
benefit more than 7 million students
and train around 200,000 teachers.
In April, ADB, in close partnership
with relevant donors, initiated the
establishment of a global financing

2016 was concentrated on financing
and leasing for small and mediumsized enterprises, money and capital
markets, inclusive finance, and
finance sector development. ADB
invested in innovative products and
advanced technology projects to
develop the region’s finance sector.
One example is the establishment
of a $500 million financing facility at
the Punjab National Bank—one of
India’s largest commercial banks—
which will use the funds to onlend

in Uzbekistan; social health insurance
and other health care programs

in Viet Nam; and universal health
coverage, elderly care, and primary
health care in Bangladesh. It also
earmarked additional ADF grants

to eligible countries to strengthen
regional health security.

For agriculture, natural resources,
and rural development, in

2016, ADB approved $1.08 billion

in sovereign loans and grants,

and $240 million in nonsovereign
investments. To improve food
supply and quality, ADB increased

its investments into agriculture and
food value chains, including logistics,
quality and safety standards, climateresilient technologies, and other
processes that enhance productivity.
ADB is also working to address the
dwindling of natural resources and
shrinking labor forces in rural areas
through the adoption of modern
technologies such as satellite
based remote sensing, geographic
information systems, drip irrigation,
and information and communication
technologies.

also continued to monitor the gender
equality results of its completed
projects. Across the region, around
727,300 women and girls received
training on health care, teaching,
banking and saving, entrepreneurship,
and the operation and maintenance
of irrigation and other civil works.
ADB helped around 62,800 women
start activities to generate an income
or improve their livelihoods, while
about 97,400 women participated in
local governance and communitylevel committees and groups. In the
Lao PDR, ADB helped give women
and children from minority groups
access to high-quality health care
and treatment. The project saw the
proportion of births attended by a
skilled nurse increase from 25% to
58% in project areas.

Environment and Climate

first Green Business Forum to
highlight the role of the private
sector in achieving environmentally
sustainable growth. The forum
attracted more than 400 participants,
including green business leaders,
government officials, and other
stakeholders looking to share
innovative green business solutions,
exchange knowledge on clean
technologies and sustainable
management approaches, and

build partnerships. In 2016, ADB
also backed country-specific and
regional projects to support different
aspects of sustainability. In the PRC,

supported the issuance of a certified
project climate bond—a first for a
single project in an emerging market.
Working with the private sector,
ADB also approved $100 million

to demonstrate climate-resilient
farming systems in the PRC. The
Climate Change Fund, capitalized
by ADB’s own net income, played

a pivotal role in managing climate
risks in ADB investments. In 2016,
ADB was able to secure approval

of $12 million from the Green
Climate Fund for the Cook Islands
to install energy storage systems and
support private sector investment
in renewable energy. The Green
Climate Fund also approved a grant
of $5 million to support a renewable
energy program in the Pacific,
which will help the Cook Islands,
the Marshall Islands, the Federated
States of Micronesia, Nauru, Papua

generation and toward solar power,
hydropower, and wind energy.

Disaster Resilience. In 2016, ADB
approved funding for 52 projects
that directly reduced disaster

risk, integrated disaster resilience
measures, or supported disaster
response. ADB approved $200
million to help establish a national
disaster risk management fund

in Pakistan. It approved its first

disaster contingency loan, providing
$10 million to the Cook Islands. In
the wake of Cyclone Winston in Fiji,
ADB approved a loan of $50 million
for short-term financing of disaster
recovery programs, including
infrastructure reconstruction,
school rehabilitation, and housing
assistance. It also provided
humanitarian disaster assistance
grants from the Asia Pacific Disaster
Response Fund to Fiji, Mongolia,
the Marshall Islands, Sri Lanka, and
Viet Nam. ADB is increasing efforts
to incorporate disaster risk reduction
into its projects. It is strengthening
tools to screen climate risks and

is developing related guidance
materials. This will help ADB better
integrate disaster risk reduction into
country partnership strategies and
individual projects.

piloted new initiatives to strengthen
public service delivery at the local

for sustainable development. In
Armenia, ADB provided a second
phase of support for a program

to improve public financial
management and utility regulation,
leading to better management

and enhanced sustainability of the
country’s road, water, and power
assets. In Pakistan, ADB approved a
reform program that will introduce
new corporate governance rules into

COLLABORATION
DELIVERS GREATER
IMPACT

ADB knows that it takes coordinated
effort and combined resources

to address the enormous
development challenges across

Asia and the Pacific. In 2016, it

     

achieved $31.70 billion in operations
by leveraging $14.06 billion in
cofinancing (including trust

funds administered by ADB).

It attracted 60% of cofinancing from
official development institutions
and other concessional sources,
including bilateral and multilateral
organizations, other public agencies,
national partners, and corporate
programs for social responsibility.

It drew 40% from commercial
cofinancing sources.

During the year, ADB entered into
an innovative guarantee agreement
with the Swedish International
Development Cooperation Agency,
which will allow ADB to increase

its financing by $500 million

over the next 10 years. ADB also
established two new trust funds.
The first is the Leading Asia’s Private
Sector Infrastructure Fund, with

$1.5 billion in equity from the Japan
nternational Cooperation Agency
to fill financing gaps and increase
access to finance of nonsovereign
infrastructure projects in Asia and
the Pacific. The second is the Project
Readiness Improvement Trust

Fund, with an initial contribution

of $7.7 million from the Nordic
Development Fund. This trust fund
will help countries in Southeast

Asia improve project readiness and
develop climate-resilient projects. In
2016, ADB finalized new frameworks
or cofinancing with the Agence
Frangaise de Développement, the
Eurasian Development Bank, and
the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries Fund for
nternational Development. It

also approved its first two projects
to be cofinanced with the Asian

ADB and other multilateral
development banks continued to
partner with commercial banks,
project developers, and other
financiers to mobilize financing for
private sector projects. In 2016,
ADB-supported nonsovereign
projects mobilized $5.84 billion in
financing from external sources.
B-loans (where commercial banks
lend under ADB’s umbrella) and
parallel cofinancing contributed
$3.4 billion to this figure. Through

its Trade Finance Program and its
Supply Chain Finance Program,
ADB generated $1.9 billion to
facilitate regional trade. ADB further
extended its financial reach with
guarantees and risk transfers of
$282 million.

ADB continues to support
public-private partnerships,
with the aim of increasing private
sector participation in public
infrastructure. It has done so

by building the capacity of key
public sector agencies in DMCs;
by strengthening policy, legal,
and institutional frameworks; by
supporting project preparation
activities; and by financing public
 

private partnership projects.

To help develop bankable
projects, ADB secured five new
transaction advisory mandates in
2016, to advise on infrastructure
projects totaling approximately
$1.5 billion. It continues to
capitalize on donor trust funds,
such as the Asia Pacific Project
Preparation Facility.

ADB aims to strengthen its
credentials as a knowledge
institution further. It aligns
knowledge work with the needs
of its DMCs through country
knowledge plans and knowledge
partnerships, as well as learning
across sector and thematic groups.
ADB has introduced new tools

to focus on client needs and
create efficiencies in knowledge
management. These tools include
a planning tool for knowledge
products and services, a repository
that promotes the reuse of sector
and thematic learning materials,
and Development Asia, a proofof-concept website that uses a
digital-first and evidence-based
approach to make it easier to
create, find, and use content.

The ADB Board of Governors approves the merger of the lending
operations of the Asian Development Fund with the institution’s
ordinary capital resources balance sheet. The move will increase
ADB’s financing capacity (annual approvals of new loans and
grants) to $20 billion by 2020 and allow greater support for the
developing member countries most in need.

Many of the economies in Central
and West Asia experienced another
difficult year in 2016.

As revenues from oil and natural
gas again dropped significantly

over the year, the hydrocarbon
exporters—Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan—
faced weakened fiscal positions and
current accounts. While Kazakhstan
undertook a fiscal stimulus program
to counteract the effects of sharp
inflation, Azerbaijan could not avert a
recession in 2016.

The economies of Armenia, Georgia,
and Tajikistan were confronted by
further reductions in remittances,
because the ongoing recession in
the Russian Federation and slower
growth in Central Asia’s commodityexporting countries meant fewer
employment opportunities for
migrant workers.

On the other hand, the Kyrgyz
Republic joined the Eurasian
Economic Union, improving its
access to the labor market in the
Russian Federation. This contributed
to the recovery of remittances
received by the Kyrgyz Republic

in 2016.

Despite the challenges of ongoing
conflict and regional instability,
economic growth in Afghanistan
was sustained in 2016. In Pakistan,
export performance remained
weak, but the economy benefited
from the combined impact of the
government’s macroeconomic and
structural reform program, along with
low global oil prices, which reduced
the country’s import bill.

OPERATIONAL
HIGHLIGHTS

In 2016, ADB approved $4.76 billion in
loans and grants to improve the lives of
people in Central and West Asia, and
attracted $2.18 billion in cofinancing.
About $2.98 billion worth of contracts
were awarded, and ADB disbursed
about $3.05 billion.

ADB earmarked three quarters

of its lending and grants in 2016

for energy (31%), public sector
management (24%), and transport
(21%). The remaining quarter was
allocated to finance (11%); water

and urban infrastructure (7%); and
agriculture, natural resources, and rural
development (6%).

In the energy sector, ADB approved
almost $1.5 billion and about

$500 million in cofinancing to improve
electricity infrastructure and increase
the regional production and export of
gas. Two projects were approved to
rehabilitate more than 3,000 kilometers
(km) of distribution lines in Azerbaijan
and expand the high-voltage
transmission network in Pakistan.

In December, ADB committed a

Uzbekistan’s southern region, which accounts for 90% of domestic gas production,
receives electricity from the northern provinces, where 70% of power generation
infrastructure is currently located. This means gas is transported at great cost

to the north where it is burned to produce electricity, which is then sent back to

“The plant will save 500 million cubic meters of gas per year,” says Murod Karimov,
the plant’s construction manager.

Getting the gas turbines to Kashkadarya Province took more than a year. The
two 400-ton turbines traveled over 16,800 km from Kobe, Japan. They were

Bolnisi, and Chiatura.

ADB also provided a program loan
of $100 million to help the
Government of Georgia better
manage debt, fiscal risk, revenue, and
public expenditure. The program will
help address inequality of income

by creating more opportunities for
businesses and individuals (with 40%
of resources allocated to businesses
owned by women).

In Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, ADB is
supporting credit lines to help micro,
small, and medium-sized enterprises.
In Kazakhstan, ADB will help 5,000
microenterprises (with at least 50%
owned by women) and 1,000 small
and medium-sized enterprises (with
at least 33% owned by women). ADB
has allocated 60% of the funds for
areas outside Almaty and Astana. In
Uzbekistan, ADB will support 6,700
businesses (with at least 20% owned

GREEN PROJECTS TO
BOOST FOOD SECURITY
In 2016, ADB assessed around

40 projects for better management
of climate risks in the countries

of Central and West Asia. It also
approved 24 projects related to
environmental sustainability in

the region.

In Afghanistan, ADB invested

$76 million to rehabilitate and
upgrade irrigation infrastructure,
including watershed management.
The project will increase agricultural
productivity in the Panj-Amu River
Basin, improving cropping intensities,
irrigated areas, and crop yields across
74,500 hectares.

In October, ADB approved financial
assistance of $30 million—including

a combined grant and technical
assistance of $5 million from the
Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction—to
boost agriculture production and food
security in Tajikistan. The project will
improve water resource management
in the Pyanj River Basin. It aims

to modernize and climate-proof
irrigation and drainage infrastructure,
while enhancing farmers’ water-use
and farm management skills.

BEYOND BORDERS

ADB initiated a flagship study that
aims to identify the conditions

needed to create good jobs
in Central Asia and the South
Caucasus. The study examines
current policy frameworks,
employment and labor market
policies, and the impact of recent
external economic shocks. It will
provide policy recommendations
for strategies that can build skills
that are in high market demand

and promote greater labor market
flexibility. It will also recommend
strategies to create employment
through private sector development
and economic diversification in

the region.

In June, ADB published a gender
assessment for Tajikistan that
reexamined the country’s gender
barriers to economic opportunities,
social services, and leadership
positions. The assessment identified
entry points for promoting gender
equality in agriculture and natural
resources, education, energy,
entrepreneurship and small business
development, and transport.

ADB begins an investment program that, by 2016, helps to build
or upgrade nearly 6,500 kilometers of roads across Central and

The economies of East Asia posted
contrasting results in 2016.

Economic growth in the People’s
Republic of China (PRC) averaged
6.7%. The Government of the PRC is
making progress in rebalancing the
economy from investment-driven

to consumption-driven growth.

while this rebalancing is desirable,

it is putting pressure on specific

and disparities in regional and
urban-rural living standards remain a
challenge. In March, the government
adopted the Thirteenth Five-Year

a comprehensive reform agenda to
tackle these challenges. The plan also
addresses the need to protect the

OPERATIONAL
HIGHLIGHTS

In 2016, ADB approved $1.86 billion for
15 sovereign loan and grant projects
in East Asia. This assistance, together
with $515.8 million of cofinancing, was
allocated to energy (35%), agriculture
and natural resources and rural
development (30%), transport (13%),
water and other urban infrastructure
and services (9%), industry and trade
(7%), health (3%), public sector
management (2%), and finance (1%).
In addition, ADB approved $18.2
million for 43 technical assistance
projects.

ADB responded to pressing
development needs in the PRC,
including severe air pollution and
major demographic changes. ADB
approved $500 million in December
to improve air quality in the BeijingTianjin—Hebei region. The loan will
reduce the greenhouse gas emissions
from small and medium-sized
enterprises by 5 million tons per year
by 2024, directly benefitting about
268 million people.

ADB also approved a $150 million
project that will focus on
environmental protection, ecological
rehabilitation, and climate change

technical assistance projects on
PPPs provided training workshops
to more than 1,000 government
officials and produced four
knowledge products. In July, an
international conference attracted
more than 150 participants to
Hegang City, Heilongjiang province
to discuss opportunities for
economic diversification of four
cities that have been in economic

decline due to reliance on coal
mining. In November, ADB held
an international conference on
ecocompensation, a tool developed
by the Government of the PRC

to promote ecological protection.
ADB also held its first countrywide
workshop on gender equality in
the labor market titled “Gender,
Labor and Migration in the PRC.”
Throughout the year, the Regional
Knowledge Sharing Initiative, a
program jointly established by
ADB and the PRC government to
facilitate exchange of developmentrelated knowledge among ADB’s
DMCs, hosted events in the PRC
on water resources management,
special economic zones, structural

Before Maino participated in financial literacy training, provided with ADB
support, she had no choice but to travel many hours to her nearest bank branch.

The training is part of an ADB project to expand microfinance in PNG, aiming to
improve financial literacy and provide sustainable financial services across the
country. About 85% of PNG’s population live in rural areas, and a large proportion
of these people have very limited education and low literacy rates. Most people

by disasters in 2016.

Cyclone Winston, the strongest
storm ever to make landfall in the
Southern Hemisphere, struck Fiji

in February and killed 44 people.

In response, ADB mobilized an initial
$2 million grant from the Asia-Pacific
Disaster Response Fund, which

was disbursed within a week of the
disaster. ADB followed this with a
$50 million emergency assistance
loan—with cofinancing of a similar
amount from the World Bank—

to help the government reconstruct
schools and homes. ADB similarly
provided emergency support for
drought-affected areas in the
Marshall Islands.

In the Cook Islands, ADB agreed toa

The urban population in the

Pacific is rapidly growing, and ADB
recognizes the need to improve
living conditions in the region’s urban
areas. ADB was able to help Fiji
become the first beneficiary of the
Green Climate Fund (GCF), with a
$31 million grant approved. Together
with financing from ADB and the
European Investment Bank, the GCF
grant will improve sustainable water
supply and sewerage services for
more than 290,000 people in Suva,
including informal settlers. ADB has
also committed to improving water
supply and waste management
systems in Kiribati, Tonga, and
Vanuatu.

ADB continues to lead the shift to
renewable energy in the Pacific. It

is helping countries improve energy
security, transition to low-carbon
economies, and expand energy
access. In the Cook Islands, Solomon
Islands, and Tonga, ADB has
approved $7 million, supplemented
by $10 million in cofinancing from
the Global Environment Facility and
Strategic Climate Fund, to increase

vital for the small and isolated
economies of the Pacific. In

2016, ADB approved financing

for the University of the South
Pacific (USP), the premier higher
education institution in the region,
to open a new campus in Solomon
Islands. This follows USP’s
successful expansion in Kiribati,
where an ADB-financed campus
was opened in 2016. ADB also
worked with USP to co-sponsor the
annual Pacific Update Conference,
held in Fiji in July. Attendees shared

BENCHMARKING PACIFIC
STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES
Historically, weak governance and poor
regulatory frameworks make it difficult
for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to
operate on a strict commercial basis. In
2016, ADB assessed the performance of
several SOEs in the Pacific, emphasizing
that political commitment to reform
needs to bea key driver for commercial
results. The 10 participating countries
demonstrated a willingness to identify
and address core issues within their
SOEs. The resulting publication was

Despite global headwinds, South Asia
sustained its recent rapid economic
growth in 2016, expanding by 6.6%.

India’s economy grew an estimated
7.1% to provide impetus for the
wider region. Notwithstanding

the government’s decision in
November to remove highdenomination banknotes from
circulation, thereby affecting cash
transactions, economic momentum
is expected to remain robust.

Bangladesh saw gross domestic
product grow 7.1%, propelled

largely by increased consumption
and revived exports. Bhutan’s
economy grew by 6.4%, supported

by strong results in the industrial

and services sectors. In Sri Lanka,
economic growth tapered to

4% due to weak agricultural and
industrial performance. In June,

the International Monetary Fund
provided support to the country’s
economic reform efforts. The
Maldives’ economy recovered slightly
to expand 3.4%, up from 2.8% in 2015,
mainly due to boosts in construction
and tourism. In Nepal, growth of 0.8%
reflected lost income and productive
capacity caused by the lingering
effects of the 2015 earthquakes, a
second year of bad weather, and
supply disruption from 6 months of
protests against specific provisions in
the country’s new constitution.

South Asia needs to develop further

OPERATIONAL
HIGHLIGHTS

In 2016, ADB approved $4.4 billion

in loans and grants covering

30 projects in South Asia. Grants

for technical assistance reached

$54.1 million, of which $19.4 million
came from external funds. ADB
awarded new project contracts
valued at $3.57 billion, and disbursed
$2.94 billion. It also raised $2.36 billion
in cofinancing for the region.

ADB supported the areas critical for
sustained and inclusive economic
growth in South Asia. It directed its
investments mainly to transport (40%),
energy (18%), finance (16%), and urban
services (10%).

ADB invested in transport to promote
regional connectivity and increase
mobility in rural and urban areas of
the region. In June, ADB approved a
loan of $500 million to build India’s
longest bridge across the Ganges River.
The 9.8-kilometer (km) bridge will
provide vital transport links between
the northern and southern parts of
Bihar as well as with neighboring
Nepal, benefiting 9 million people. In
August, ADB approved $9.69 million
in assistance to the Maldives to
construct a passenger and cargo
harbor on Kulhudhuffushi Island.
The project aims to connect services,
markets, people, and harbors, with
greater accessibility and affordability
for 8,000 residents on the island and
30,000 living nearby. In September,
ADB confirmed a $4.26 million road
improvement project for Bhutan.

The project will enhance travel and
trade opportunities for approximately
100,000 residents of Thimphu.

India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka

FLOWER POWER SEES SHAHAN’S BUSINESS BLOSSOM

It was late afternoon and Shahan Ara was working hard to pluck all the flowers in her
field in the Jessore district of southwestern Bangladesh. Shahan was aiming to send
flowers to the market ahead of the national Independence Day celebration.

In a country where subsistence farming is still common, Shahan Ara is a rarity. Rather
than grow rice, she cultivates flowers—a high-value crop that is more complex to farm,
but commands higher market prices.

Shahan Ara’s shift from traditional farming to high-value cultivation was inspired

by her participation in a crop diversification project run by the Government of
Bangladesh. The project, financed through an ADB loan of $40 million, forms part of a
broad national effort to expand agricultural productivity and increase farming incomes.

business expanded significantly since her involvement with the crop diversification
project, leading to a 150% increase in her income.

Since 2012, the project has helped over 250,000 farmers—more than half of them
women—to double their income. About 70,000 hectares of land are now devoted to
diversified crop farming, and about 200,000 farmers have received more than $60,000
in loans to help make the transition from traditional crops. The project has introduced
and promoted 35 high-value crops. In addition to improving the overall efficiency of
farms, and linking them to markets, farmers learn specialized skills to cultivate the
often delicate and temperamental high-value plants.

With inclusive growth as a priority,
ADB projects in South Asia are
helping to provide broader access
to sustainable power, potable water,
and quality education, while making
travel easier between villages, towns,
and cities.

To improve access to markets

and job opportunities for remote
communities, ADB confirmed

$300 million in April for a project in
Uttar Pradesh, one of India’s poorest
states and home to about 200
million people, to upgrade 430 km
of major district roads. In December,
ADB also backed a South Asia
Subregional Economic Cooperation
(SASEC) project of $186.80 million to
rehabilitate and upgrade about

160 km of Nepal’s road network.

In September, ADB approved
$60 million in funding for local
governments in Sri Lanka to
provide safe drinking water in four
provinces for people troubled by
chronic kidney disease.

In Nepal, ADB continued to back a
project to improve the Bagmati River
Basin’s environment, heritage sites,
and water quality. The project involves
building a reservoir at the river’s source
to ensure minimum year-round water
flows, as well as providing river bank
beautification.

the SASEC operational plan identified
over 200 potential projects requiring
more than $120 billion in development
assistance over the next 5 years. ADB
also supported the development of a
SASEC vision document to articulate
the region’s long-term potential as an
integrated entity.

In September, ADB approved

$631 million in loans and grants for the
Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial
Corridor in India. As a holistic and
multisectoral approach to urbanindustrial development, the corridor
is expected to play a vital role not only
in unifying the large domestic market,
but also in integrating the Indian
economy into global value chains and
opening up trade opportunities with
neighboring countries in South Asia.
Of the total assistance, $500 million

The railway will serve as an alternative
mode of transport for about 50% of
bus trips—improving road safety and
reducing greenhouse gas emissions by
more than 10,500 tons in 1 year.

KNOWLEDGE SHARING
FOR RESULTS

In 2016, ADB responded to calls by
South Asian countries for knowledge
work that will result in investments
to address ongoing development
challenges.

ADB initiated studies on economic
corridor development in the region,
then held workshops in the Indian

 

states of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha,
Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal, as well
as in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. At
these workshops, ADB outlined the
concept, framework, and components
of the economic corridor model, and
then presented the findings of the
studies.

In May, ADB launched the book
Scaling New Heights: Vizag-Chennai
Industrial Corridor, India’s First
Coastal Corridor, which provides
policymakers with an overview of the
strategic application of economic
corridor development principles. In
December, ADB published Challenges
in Implementing Best Practices

in Involuntary Resettlement—

A Case Study in Sri Lanka, covering
experiences in relocating people
displaced by transport development
in the country’s south. In partnership
with Oxford University Press (India),

Committed to helping Indonesia
address the dual problems of prolonged
economic slowdown and rising
inequality in household incomes, ADB
approved (in June and November,
respectively) two policy-based
programs, each worth $500 million.
The first program provides support

for reforms to improve the country’s
investment climate. It aims to leverage
business regulatory reforms; open

up service sectors to foreign direct
investment; reduce nontariff trade
barriers; strengthen the institutional,
policy, and regulatory framework

for public-private partnerships

in infrastructure; and improve
transparency and competition in public
procurement. The second program
seeks to reduce income inequality by
better aligning the public expenditure
framework with the government’s
sustainable development goals (SDGs)
in education, health, infrastructure,
and social protection. The program
also supports SDGs specific to local
government, through better targeted
fiscal transfers and improved service
delivery performance.

In December, ADB approved

$250 million to help the Philippines
streamline public expenditure and
boost municipal revenue streams

to provide better basic services and
drive local economic development. In
Viet Nam, ADB approved a program of
$200 million to improve public financial
management systems and enable

the government to provide better
infrastructure.

ADB also supported projects and
programs to improve access to
education in Southeast Asia. In

 

February, it approved an additional
loan of $400 million to expand the
Philippines’ flagship conditional

cash transfer program. This program
provides regular health and education
grants to around 4.4 million of the
country’s poorest households.

To improve transport routes, ADB is
contributing $286 million to construct
around 25 kilometers of expressway
between Ben Luc and Long Thanh,
south of Ho Chi Minh City, a short

link to the southern corridor of the
Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS).

Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. ADB is also
assisting Viet Nam in developing

a national water accounting
system based on remote sensing
of variables, such as rainfall, ina

In September, ADB approved a
$109 million flood management
project in Indonesia, including soil
and water conservation programs
to reduce soil erosion and sediment
transfer. ADB also approved a grant
to address deforestation and forest
degradation in West Kalimantan. In
addition, ADB approved a technical
assistance project to pilot a carbon

in Indonesia, the first CCS project
in Southeast Asia, providing a
foundation for CCS to reduce the
region’s greenhouse gas emissions.

In November, ADB approved

a project to rehabilitate critical

1992ADB CENTRALIZES
KNOWLEDGE SHARING
In January, ADB launched an
innovative technical assistance
program titled “Knowledge
Development Support for Southeast
Asia.” Through the program, ADB

has facilitated quick and effective
responses to the knowledge
requirements of its developing
member countries, while reducing
administrative costs. The program

is currently supporting five countrybased knowledge initiatives and seven
regional knowledge initiatives.

Among the program’s country-based
initiatives, ADB is providing policy
support to the new Government of
the Philippines. ADB helped prepare
thematic studies that framed longterm strategies in the Philippines’

key development areas of health,
education, employment, infrastructure,
environment, and governance. It is
also helping to finalize knowledge
products for the government’s longterm development vision. In Viet Nam,

 

ADB is supporting the marketing,
advertising, and customer service
development of the Ha Noi Metro
rail system to enhance patronage,
generate additional revenue, and
ensure the system’s sustainability.

 

  

The program’s regional knowledge
initiatives include studies on logistics
and special economic zones in the
GMS. In collaboration with leading
private sector representatives, ADB
helped provide GMS nations with

a set of policy recommendations

to develop special economic zones
further and, ultimately, strengthen
the competitiveness of the GMS
economic corridors.

Outside the technical assistance
program, ADB produced a series of
nine reports that recommended a

range of transport policy reforms and

initiatives for Myanmar. Presented to
Myanmar’s new government in April,
the reports have helped promote
dialogue and identify opportunities
for sustainable transport projects.

 

LIGHTING THE WAY FOR

in remote villages of Myanmar,

where access to modern energy
services was lacking. The project is
improving livelihoods and promoting
environmentally sustainable energy

The private sector is the single most powerful catalyst for
creating employment and generating economic growth. It

is critical to achieving the globally agreed goals of ending
absolute poverty and allowing all human beings to fulfill their
potential. ADB intends to have private sector support become
50% of its annual approvals by 2020.

In 2016, ADB continued to help its developing member
countries (DMCs) improve their business environments
and foster competitiveness in the private sector. To
generate private investment to fund development needs,
ADB further advocated, promoted, and invested in public—
private partnerships (PPPs). It also directly provided finance
to privately developed infrastructure projects, financial

generated $5.84 billion in cofinancing, which increased by
almost $1.2 billion compared to 2015. This includes a record
$238 million in official cofinancing to support nonsovereign
operations.

SUPPORTING BUSINESS ACROSS ASIA
AND THE PACIFIC

Boosting Private Participation in Key Projects

ADB's Office of Public-Private Partnership (OPPP) continued
to show strong progress in its second full year of operations.

In 2016, OPPP was successful in securing five new transaction
advisory mandates in Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Malaysia,

Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. In addition to delivering much
needed transport, energy, and healthcare infrastructure, these
mandates are expected to strengthen the capacity of agencies
involved, and create a template for future PPPs in individual
countries and sectors.

enterprise (GOE)—on a project to
refurbish over 100,000 road lights
using energy-efficient diode lamps,
supporting Malaysia’s drive to cut
its greenhouse gas emissions by
40% by 2020. OPPP is also advising
the Ministry of Health and Social
Development of Kazakhstan to
build, equip, and maintain a 300-bed
multifunctional teaching hospital
at the Karaganda State Medical
University.

n May 2016, ADB expanded the
scope of its transaction advisory
services to serve private sector
sponsors on a pilot basis. This
advisory service was created to help
private sector investors structure
bankable transactions and raise
inancing for complex and innovative
projects that accelerate the delivery
of critical infrastructure.

The Asia Pacific Project Preparation
Facility (AP3F), managed by OPPP,
officially launched operations after
obtaining approval from its donor
countries: Australia, Canada, and
Japan. To generate awareness for
the resources available under AP3F,
ADB conducted outreach efforts in
25 DMCs. It approved a total of six
applications for technical assistance
rom Bangladesh, Indonesia,
azakhstan, Myanmar, and TimorLeste. AP3F will provide technical
assistance for project preparation,

 

 

 

capacity building and policy
reform, and project monitoring or
restructuring support.

Under AP3F, technical assistance
to Bangladesh involves providing
legal support to prepare the Dhaka
Bypass project, and will generate
templates and guidelines that
benefit other road PPP projects in
the country. Technical assistance
to Timor-Leste will provide
engineering resources to the PPP
and Loans Unit of the Ministry

of Finance, helping ensure that
their PPP projects meet quality
standards. Technical assistance

to Myanmar will help restructure
existing road concessions suffering
from financial distress, lack of
investment, or poor performance.

ADB regional departments also
worked to accelerate the adoption
of the PPP modality across Asia and
the Pacific.

In Central and West Asia, ADB
successfully completed the
transaction advisory mandate for
the 1,600-kilometer TurkmenistanAfghanistan-Pakistan-India natural
gas pipeline project. As transaction
advisor, ADB helped establish the
project company and facilitated
agreement among the parties on
their shareholding percentages and
the deployment of their own funds
to finance detailed engineering

and route surveys, environmental
and social safeguard studies,

and procurement and financing
activities in the project’s next phase.
In Pakistan, ADB is helping the
government implement a program
to support PPP investments in Sindh
Province.

   

In East Asia, ADB approved a loan
of $50 million to help the Yichang
municipal government in the People’s
Republic of China (PRC) design and
implement a PPP for elderly care
services. This is ADB’s first sovereign
results-based loan to help local
governments undertake PPPs that
deliver social services. The total cost
of the project is $128.4 million, with
the Yichang municipal government
contributing $55 million and the
private sector expected to contribute
$23.4 million.

In the Pacific, ADB continued to
support privatization and PPP
transactions through the Private
Sector Development Initiative. ADB
successfully concluded a concession
contract for Tonga Forest Products
and developed privatization strategies

ADB SPARKS INVESTMENT IN CAMBODIAN SOLAR Rr

Ever since Cambodia emerged from an era of conflict, ADB has been helping
the country transition to a market-oriented economy driven by inclusive and
sustainable growth. Annual growth rates in recent years have exceeded 7%, and
poverty (defined by those living on less than $1.90 a day) has plummeted from
47.8% in 2007 to 13.5% in 2014.

Despite this rapid economic development, the legacy of the civil conflict

that devastated Cambodia’s national infrastructure remains. While access to
electricity in the country rose from 20.3% of the population in 2007 to 55% of
the population in 2015, the rate is still among the lowest in Southeast Asia.

ADB is helping address this issue by driving private investment in solar power.

While solar power has great potential in Cambodia, it contributes less than 0.1%
to the country’s energy mix and is not used at utility scale. However, with recent
technological advances, utility-scale solar plants can now operate at production
costs that compete with traditional energy sources.

To embrace these opportunities, the Government of Cambodia competitively
selected the Sunseap Group to install a solar plant with enough capacity to
power around 15,000 homes. In December 2015, ADB approved a loan of $9.85
million to Sunseap and a local partner. In addition to $3.6 million from ADB
resources, the loan mobilizes $3 million of cofinancing from an international
commercial bank and $3.25 million from the Canadian Climate Fund for the
Private Sector in Asia, under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility
administered by ADB.

Supporting Agriculture
ADB’s Agribusiness Investment Team,
created in 2015, ramped up its activity
in 2016. In June, ADB approved a
direct loan of $62.5 million, with

a B-loan for the same amount, to
support dairy farming and milk safety
in rural areas of the PRC. The project
will increase raw milk safety treatment
from 220,000 tons to 500,000 tons
per year and build biogas plants to
process manure into organic fertilizer,
reducing greenhouse gas emissions by
66,000 tons each year. In December,
ADB approved a loan of $20 million
to Agripacific Holdings and Kunming
Hasfarm Flowers to support the
livelihoods of farmers in the PRC,
Indonesia, and Viet Nam. This project
will foster regional integration by
strengthening regional markets and
cross-border trade, investment, and
technology transfer.

Nurturing Small Business
In June, ADB confirmed a $150 million
investment in debt securities for
Janalakshmi Financial Services to

help expand access to finance by
microenterprises in India, with a
special focus on businesses owned

by women. ADB also approved a loan
of $200 million to IndusInd Bank to
double the size of the bank’s inclusive
finance business by providing loans

to individuals or micro enterprises.
The investment will be complemented
with technical assistance to support
financial literacy for women, improve
digital loan processing, and introduce
new financially inclusive products.

the energy efficiency of production
facilities.

ADB approved an investment

of $20 million in the Vietnam
Investments Fund III. The fund will
invest in middle-market companies in
Viet Nam, Myanmar, and across the
wider Mekong subregion. Through
the fund, ADB is supporting health

Financing Trade Beyond Borders
Through its Trade Finance
Program (TFP), ADB helps close
market gaps for trade finance by
providing banks with guarantees

and loans to support cross-border
trade. An ADB study, Trade Finance
Gaps, Growth, and Jobs was released
in September and identified a global
market gap for trade finance of

$1.6 trillion, of which $692 billion was
needed in developing Asia. Lowerincome countries and SMEs tended
to have the highest market gaps and
unmet demand. In 2016, the TFP
supported 2,079 transactions valued
at over $3 billion (of which $1.8 billion
was cofinanced by banks, private
insurers, an export credit agency, and
International Enterprise Singapore).
Of the total transactions, 1,597
supported SMEs and 368 supported
trade between DMCs. Among the
20 countries covered by the TFP,

the 6 most active were Armenia,
Bangladesh, Mongolia, Pakistan,

Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam.

During 2016, the TFP expanded into
the Pacific for the first time, signing
trade finance agreements with two
Samoan banks and one bank in
Vanuatu. It also expanded operations
in Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Myanmar,

ORGANIZATION

POLICY AND STRATEGY OVERVIEW

ADB continues to implement a comprehensive agenda of
operational and organizational reforms under its Midterm
Review Action Plan. The plan details 192 actions to strengthen
ADB’s operational efficiency and effectiveness, improve internal
capacity, respond to the challenging development environment,
and sharpen ADB's strategic focus. Implementation is on track.
As of December 2016, of the 192 actions, 147 actions have been
fully implemented, 25 are largely implemented, and 14 actions
have been partly implemented. Only 6 actions have not yet been
implemented. Most of the time-bound actions are expected to be
completed within 2017.

In 2016, ADB worked to simplify its documentation and review
protocols, and streamline approval processes. Measures to
improve disbursement performance resulted in one of the highest
recorded disbursement levels for ADB in recent years, reaching
$12.26 billion in 2016. Building on a10-point procurement reform
action plan, ADB has started to implement the second phase

of its procurement reforms to increase procurement efficiency
and the quality of consultants and contractors. The reforms will
further simplify procurement procedures with greater flexibility,
faster procurement times, and the use of new and advanced
technologies in project design and implementation. ADB also
continued to enhance development effectiveness by increasing
project readiness and improving project management.

In December, ADB approved the revision of its Anticorruption
Policy to respond to global developments and enhance measures
for addressing tax secrecy, tax evasion, and legal forms of
aggressive tax planning at both the country and project levels.

ADB has been fine-tuning its lending facilities in response to the
new needs and demands of its developing member countries
(DMCs). In 2016, it reviewed its Countercyclical Support Facility
(CSF). The facility was originally launched in 2009 as a shortterm instrument to provide financial assistance to governments in
the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.

ADB further refined the instrument and development finance targets were

clarified its eligibility criteria.

ADB has started the process of
modernizing and transforming its
existing information technology

(IT) systems. New technology will
deliver integrated operations, with
financial and knowledge platforms
that are supported by cloud services
for better reporting capabilities and
more mobile support services. Several
IT reforms were initiated throughout
2016 to improve ADB’s disbursements,
institutional procurement, treasury
operations, nonsovereign operations,
and human resources management
systems.

ENSURING ADB’S
EFFECTIVENESS

Managing for Results

ADB uses a corporate results
framework with an annual performance
scorecard to measure and manage its
performance. The corporate results
framework tracks the development
progress of the region, ADB’s
contributions to country outcomes,
and its operational and institutional
effectiveness. Every year, ADB
publishes the scorecard in its annual
Development Effectiveness Review
(DEfR). The 2016 DEfR report assesses
ADB's performance from 2013-2016.

The 2016 DEfR showed that ADB’s
efforts and reforms are working and
performance is improving. The success
rates of completed sovereign ADB
operations improved considerably
compared with 2013, while gender
equality results targets were met. The

met, including direct value-added
cofinancing, project development
transactions for public-private
partnerships (PPPs), and PPP
leveraging. However, the 2016 DEfR
identified challenges relating to delays
in starting up operations, rising but
still low levels of sustainability in
completed operations, and a lack of
progress in promoting women to ADB
international staff positions. ADB is
addressing these issues.

Meeting a New Global Agenda
ADB has renewed its commitment
with United Nations partners for
regular Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) reporting and shared
policy analysis of SDG implementation
in Asia and the Pacific. ADB is

also closely collaborating with

other multilateral development

banks (MDBs) to expand financing
opportunities in areas such as climate
finance, and reporting on private
financing catalyzed by MDBs.

ADB has initiated work on anew
corporate strategy, Strategy 2030, to
respond to new global development
agendas. At the same time, a review of
the ADB results framework is exploring
ways to align ADB performance
indicators with SDG outcomes that
are relevant to Asia and the Pacific
and ADB’s strategic directions. The
enhanced financing capacity, made
possible by the merger of the Asian
Development Fund (ADF) with
ordinary capital resources (OCR),
effective January 2017, allows ADB

to respond to strong DMC demand

to support the SDGs and combat
climate change. At the operational
level, ADB lending support for the

SDGs is being customized to countryspecific conditions, in line with the
development plans and priorities of
individual DMCs.

Ensuring Country Safeguards
Country safeguard systems refer

to the laws, regulations, rules,

and procedures in the policy

areas of environment, involuntary
resettlement, and indigenous
peoples, and their implementing
institutions. In 2016, as required

by its Safeguard Policy Statement,
ADB assessed all projects for their
impact on the environment and their
social risks. ADB took appropriate
actions to reduce any impacts that
were identified. In May, ADB forged
a partnership agreement with the
World Bank and bilateral agencies

in the region to strengthen the
policies and capabilities of DMCs to
address impacts on the ground. ADB
conducted advanced workshops

on biodiversity, indigenous peoples,
environmental management, and
safeguard supervision for staff,
consultants, government officials, and
financial intermediaries. To encourage
South-South knowledge exchange
on good practices in safeguards,
ADB also organized conferences

on subregional country safeguard
systems in Tbilisi, Georgia and in

Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. In May,
ADB launched the first in a series of
three distance learning modules on
safeguards.

Issue Resolution

The ADB Accountability Mechanism
is an independent forum for people
adversely affected by ADB-assisted
projects to voice complaints and
seek solutions to their problems.
The Accountability Mechanism is
used as a last resort to resolve such44

1966

40

issues. This is done through the
special project facilitator (SPF), which
handles problem solving, and the
Compliance Review Panel (CRP),
which handles policy and compliance
issues. The mechanism is designed

to contribute to ADB’s development
effectiveness and improve project
quality.

In 2016, the Accountability
Mechanism received nine complaints:
six from Georgia; and one each from
India, Pakistan, and Samoa. The
details and status of each complaint
are available on the ADB website, adb.
org. The CRP monitored remedial
actions for projects in Cambodia,
India, and the Philippines, while the
SPF conducted 12 training sessions on
complaint handling in 5 DMCs.

ADB hosted the 13th Annual Meeting
of Independent Accountability
Mechanisms and a civil society
organization forum to build better
partnerships. The first report on
implementation of the Accountability
Mechanism was jointly prepared and
released by the CRP, the SPF, the
Independent Evaluation Department,
and the Sustainable Development and
Climate Change Department.

documents for disclosure. Training
of ADB staff and improvements

to the information request tracking
system continued during the year
to improve implementation of the
Public Communications Policy
(PCP). The PCP governs the release
of ADB information and the way
ADB communicates with external
stakeholders. More than 4,000
documents and reports—including
project, institutional, and evaluation
documents—were uploaded in
2016. ADB received 3,028 official
requests for documents and

95% of requests were responded

to within 20 days. In July, ADB
began a review of the PCP to assess
policy implementation and maintain
a high standard of disclosure
practices.

Human Resources Management

In 2016, ADB posted 572 job vacancies,
which generated 49,340 applications
from nationals of 65 of ADB’s

67 member countries, highlighting

the strong demand to work at ADB.
Meanwhile, ADB’s secondment
program hosted 34 secondees, and

25 graduate students entered the
internship program.

ADB enhanced its recruitment scope
to attract a wider talent pool and
refined its human resources processes,
putting more focus on transparency,
quality, and diversity. This process
included the strengthening of
protocols for talent management

and skills acquisition, allowing

ADB to respond more adeptly and
comprehensively to the changing
occupational structure and skills

mix required within an efficient
development organization. ADB also
introduced new actions for gender
equality, including targets for women’s
representation by 2022. These changes
are designed to enhance career
progression for capable, motivated,
and well-performing ADB staff.

ADB launches the first issue of
Asian Development Outlook, an
annual publication series on the
region’s economic performance and
prospects.

1989In 2016, ADB implemented an Early

Separation Program as part of efforts

to rebalance workloads and address
the organization’s skills needs.

The program contributed to ADB
reducing staffing levels by 3%.

During the year, ADB improved
the efficiency, effectiveness, and

affordability of its medical insurance;

integrated its health and wellness
services; and moved to improve the
financial sustainability of its staff
retirement plan.

Learning and Development

In 2016, ADB focused on leadership
development programs to grow and
develop strong leaders, establishing
a leadership pipeline for the future.

rd

ADB complemented these programs
with the managerial Assessment
Development Center, which
provides high-potential ADB staff
with a clearer leadership pathway.
Throughout the year, ADB provided
field offices with tailored training

in supervisory skills. It made a
priority of staff development for

a more inclusive workplace, and
rolled out workshops on mitigating
unconscious bias and strengthening
staff management in diverse and
multicultural environments.

ADB operates knowledge groups
based on particular sectors and
development themes. In 2016,
these sector and thematic groups
implemented 51 learning programs.

ADB creates its first website,

 

www.adb.org and establishes
its first representative office

in North America.

Welcome to the Asian Development Bank WWW Server!

These learning programs benefited
900 ADB staff members (687 from
ADB headquarters in Manila and

213 from field offices), and 1,536
representatives from DMCs. ADB
launched initiatives to better capture
highlights and speakers’ knowledge,
and improve processes for sharing
materials with external audiences.

MAKING THE MOST OF
ADB RESOURCES

Administrative Expenses

Net internal administrative expenses
totaled $589 million in 2016. This
represents a utilization rate of 93%
against the budget of $636 million.
ADB achieved savings of $47 million

ADB declares poverty
reduction as its
overarching goal for the
first time.46

in 2016, through efficiency measures,
close monitoring of budgetary
resources, favorable external factors,
and lower utilization in some budget
items due to reprioritization.

The net internal administrative
expenses budget for 2017 is

$647 million, a 3% increase on the
2016 budget. The 2017 budget will
support the scaling up of operations,
improving project and portfolio
quality, building organizational
resilience, and rolling out IT reforms.
The 2017 annual capital budget of
$9.7 million will fund ADB’s recurring
capital requirements.

Strengthening Risk Management
ADB maintains a corporate

culture that is acutely risk aware.

It implements business processes
that allow departments and offices
to monitor, mitigate, and manage
specific risks associated with their
operations.

In 2016, ADB paid particular
attention to risk management issues
associated with the merger of the
lending operations of the ADF with
the institution’s OCR. While this
merger will enable ADB to direct
greater resources to the countries
most in need, it has the potential

to increase ADB’s exposure to risk.
During the year, ADB conducted an
advance review of its prudential risk
management policies to anchor its
AAA credit rating, and prudentially
increased developmental lending in
anticipation of the ADF-OCR merger.

ADB continued to devote substantial
resources to managing its credit,
market, and operational risks. It

also provided technical assistance

with civil society.

 

ADB AR 2016 2001

     
  

to regional financial institutions
to expand their knowledge and
capabilities in risk management.

Audit

Through independent and objective
audit and advisory services, the
Office of the Auditor General
provides assurance that the internal
controls for managing risks and
achieving ADB’s development
objectives are operating effectively.

n 2016, the office issued 16 audit
reports, covering sovereign and
nonsovereign operations, risk
management, treasury, IT, and
inance and administration. It also
completed 11 advisory engagements
on financial and operational controls
of business units.

n July, the office hosted the
inaugural meeting of heads of
internal audit from the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations’ central
banks. In August, it released a
nowledge brief on an alternative
approach to training for internal
auditors in the public sector.

n September, the Institute of
nternal Auditors (IIA) conducted
an external quality assessment

of the office to ensure that it
conformed to IIA standards, to
evaluate its effectiveness in carrying
out its mission, and to identify
opportunities to enhance its
management and work processes.
The assessment concluded that the
office generally conforms to the I|A’s
definitions, standards, and code of
ethics. Following the assessment,
the office received the highest rating
that can be given to an internal audit
function.

 

ADB establishes its first
NGO center to cooperate

Integrity and Anticorruption
Activities

ADB’s Office of Anticorruption
and Integrity (OAT) conducts
investigations, integrity due
diligence, project procurementrelated reviews, and outreach
activities. Through these activities,
OAI| helps ensure that all ADB
funds are utilized for their intended
purposes.

In 2016, 138 entities were debarred
for violating ADB’s Anticorruption
Policy. Enforcement of the policy
acts as a deterrent to other entities.

OAI completed 7 reviews relating to
project procurement and conducted
87 seminars and workshops for

over 2,500 participants, as ADB
continued to increase the knowledge
and awareness of its stakeholders.

ADB updated its Anticorruption
Policy to support global tax

and financial developments

by enhancing its role on tax
integrity and helping DMCs meet
international standards. This policy
helps to safeguard ADB’s projects
and reputation.

ADB approved the establishment

of a Respectful Workplace Unit to
ensure a work environment that is
considerate, inclusive, and diverse.

Administrative Services

In June, ADB completed a review
(with subsequent action plan)

to enhance its business travel
arrangements and processes.
Implementing the action plan will
help increase flexibility for travelers
and improve the efficiency of travel
processes. This will reduce the time

ang processing by around 1,000
working days every year.

 
 

In July, ADB introduced an
organizational resilience framework
to allow it to fulfill its core mission

if a large disaster—natural or
otherwise—occurs in Metro Manila.
The framework outlines a set of
actions from 2016-2021 to make
ADB amore resilient organization.
In 2016, ADB established an active
disaster recovery site outside the
Philippines to replicate key financial
processes and data. Staff were
trained to operate ADB’s remote
access capability to improve the
organization’s capacity to function
during crisis. Staff and their families
were briefed on preparing for a
disaster, and emergency disaster kits
were provided to staff at low rates.

  
 

In August, ADB initiated a new
procurement policy for institutional
goods and services. The policy moves
from being based on compliance

and rules to a risk and principles
 

based approach, strengthening
internal governance and efficiency.
This is essential to modernizing
ADB’s institutional procurement and
delivering IT reforms.

ADB is committed to environmentally
sustainable operations and maintains
its international certifications in
energy management, environmental
management, occupational health
and safety, and business continuity.
In December, ADB headquarters

in Manila was recertified as gold
standard for Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design (LEED)
Existing Buildings Operations and
Maintenance (EB+OM), while the
India Resident Mission continues

to maintain its LEED EB+OM gold
standard. In 2017, ADB plans to
purchase carbon credits to offset the
CO, emissions it is unable to avoid.

Information Technology
ADB will soon harness new and
creative technology solutions to
develop a stronger, better, faster
organization.

 

    

 

Independent Evaluation

The Independent Evaluation Department
(IED) assesses the effectiveness of ADB
policies, strategies, and operations. In 2016,
IED introduced stronger quality review
mechanisms and made the dissemination of
evaluation findings more effective.

Across the year, IED evaluated ADB’s
safeguard implementation experience and
the effectiveness of ADB’s partnerships. At
the corporate level, ED contributed to the
strategic and operational directions of ADB by
evaluating ADB’s engagement with middleincome countries, conducting a comparative
institutional review of ADB’s private sector
operations, and strategically reviewing policies
on environmentally sustainable growth. At
the project level, IED updated its guidelines

or evaluating public sector operations. The
guidelines set out the principles and rating
standards to be used in preparing both selfevaluations and independent evaluations.

n October, IED completed the evaluation

of the Sri Lanka program. ADB Management
agreed on all recommendations for
improving policy reform work in the
infrastructure sectors, defining a strategy

or inclusive growth, and increasing support
for private sector development and the
education sector. Over the year, IED also
provided validations of country partnership
strategy final reviews for Bangladesh, the Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar,
and Viet Nam. The findings fed into the
preparation and design of country partnership
strategies and operational plans.

n July, IED cohosted with the Lee Kuan

Yew School of Public Policy an international
earning event, held in Singapore, on cities and
middle-income countries. The event attracted
around 300 participants from 18 countries.
Various high-profile speakers, including ADB
President Takehiko Nakao, discussed solutions
and policy responses to the challenge of

rapid urbanization in Asia and the Pacific. In
September, IED co-organized with the AsiaPacific Finance and Development Institute the
inaugural Asian Evaluation Week in Xi’an in
the People’s Republic of China. This event—
which will be held again in 2017—highlighted
the latest thinking on evaluation, including its
use for better results and accountability.

 

 

47In 2016, ADB focused on modernizing
its IT landscape, putting in motion
‘Real-Time ADB,’ This framework

for IT reforms will create a more
automated, efficient, productive,

and resilient working environment
across ADB operations. While
implementation is expected to span
the next 3 years, significant benefits
were already realized in 2016. ADB
now has better facilities for traveling
staff, easier and expanded remote
access to information systems, and use
of advanced mobile devices.

IT operations achieved significant
efficiency gains in 2016, with an 8%
reduction in recurrent IT costs, while
increasing fourfold the bandwidth

of ADB field offices. Throughout

the year, ADB further simplified its
automated operation processes.
DMCs now greatly benefit from

the introduction of a web-based
disbursement system, while jobseekers
can now access a convenient,
cloud-based e-recruitment system.
ADB encouraged continued use of
videoconferencing and internet-based
communications to achieve further
cost efficiencies. It also adjusted its
financial systems to enable the
ADF-OCR merger.

first multilateral
development bank
to adopt a corporate

resource available to all staff to
resolve workplace concerns in an
informal way. In 2016, more than
220 ADB staff members from
headquarters and field offices
contacted the ombudsperson to
discuss workplace issues.

The ombudsperson provided
feedback to ADB Management

on workplace trends, visited eight
field offices, facilitated numerous
group meetings, and developed

a forum for administrative staff.
The ombudsperson also initiated

a ‘blind lunch date’ program to
enhance networking and staff
information sharing. In September,
the ombudsperson commissioned
an evaluation of its effectiveness by
the Harvard Negotiation & Mediation

IMPACT OF THE
ADE-OCR MERGER
AND ADB’S FINANCIAL50

COMBINATION OF OCR AND ADF RESOURCES

In 2014, ADB introduced a proposal to enhance ADB’s financial capacity in a sustainable manner through more
efficient and effective management of its capital resources. The proposal entailed combining Asian Development
Fund (ADF) lending operations with ordinary capital resources (OCR) and retaining the ADF as a grant-only
operation. ADB would continue concessional lending on the same terms and conditions as currently provided to
ADF countries through the OCR window, while the ADF would continue to provide grant assistance.

In April 2015, the ADB Board of Governors adopted a resolution authorizing the termination of ADF’s loan operations
and the transfer of ADF’s loans and other assets to OCR effective 1 January 2017 (the 2015 Resolution). This
resolution was further amended in June 2016. Accordingly, on 1 January 2017, ADB transferred ADF loans and other
assets totaling $30,812 million from ADF to OCR. The transferred ADF assets composed of loans including accrued
interest totaling $27,088 million and liquid assets totaling $3,724 million. The source of funding for ADF came from
donor contributions, OCR net income transfer and set-aside resources.

The transfer of these assets was treated as a contribution from ADF to OCR and a return of the set-aside resources
from ADF to OCR. This resulted in the recognition of one-time income of $30,748 million in OCR and a return of
the set-aside resources of $64 million. The corresponding income recognized in OCR has been allocated to ordinary
reserves as from 1 January 2017 following the adoption of Board of Governors Resolution No. 387.

Appendix Tables Ai and A2 show the summary effects of the transfer of certain ADF assets on 1 January 2017.

The proportionate interest of ADF donors in the transferred assets as of 1 January 2017, taking into account the value
of paid-in donor contributions that have been made available for operational commitments which are deemed by
ADB to be applied for the transferred assets, was determined in accordance with Article V of the Regulations of

the Asian Development Fund. The value of each donor’s paid-in contributions was fixed in US dollars based on the
special drawing right value of each donor contribution as of 1 January 2017. This was then used to determine the
sources of funds in the transferred assets on 1 January 2017, the date of the termination of the ADF loan operations
and transfer of assets to OCR. Under the 2015 Resolution, the proportionate interest of an ADF donor will be taken
into account in the event of the withdrawal of that donor from ADB and ADB’s repurchase of its shares, and in

the theoretical termination of ADB operations and liquidation of its assets. Appendix Table A3 shows the funding
sources of the transferred assets.

la Le they,PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE

We witnessed a seismic shift in
the global development agenda
in 2015. In September, the
international community adopted
the Sustainable Development
Goals that will reduce poverty
and guide us toward a sustainable
future before it is too late. In
December, 195 countries agreed
on anew climate deal to keep
global warming below 2°C. These
ambitious agendas require huge
financing, and ADB stands ready to assist.

 

To ensure we can provide Asia and the Pacific with the
financing and knowledge it needs to meet the challenges
ahead, ADB is dramatically scaling up operations and
activities.

This year’s loan and grant approvals to our developing member
countries amounted to a record $16.29 billion, compared to
$13.49 billion last year. Our private sector operations also
posted a big jump to $2.63 billion from $1.92 billion last year.
With the strong support of our donors we mobilized more than
$10.74 billion in cofinancing, bringing our total operations for
2015 to $27.17 billion, the highest in ADB history.

Our record performance in 2015 reflects a growing demand
from the Asia and Pacific region for ADB’s development
assistance. Poverty persists despite the region’s impressive
growth, and infrastructure and other development needs are
monumental.

To help meet these needs, the ADB Board of Governors
unanimously endorsed in April the merger of our Asian
Development Fund lending operations with the ordinary
capital resources balance sheet. With this path-breaking
reform, ADB’s financing capacity (annual approvals of new
loans and grants) will increase to $20 billion by 2020.

 

ADB was also the first multilateral development bank to
commit to a sizable climate finance target. In September,

MANAGEMENT TEAM

NS

 

we announced that we would double our annual climate
financing to $6 billion by 2020. To support our climate work,
we also issued our first green bond. ADB approved our first
policy-based loan to the People’s Republic of China to improve
air quality in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei greater capital area.

Among our operational highlights in 2015 were our quick
responses to natural disasters, especially the earthquake in
Nepal (April) and the cyclone in Vanuatu (March). There was
also support for countries suffering from lower commodity
prices and volatility in financial markets, such as Kazakhstan
and Mongolia.

To attract financial resources and management skills from
the private sector for infrastructure development, our Office
of Public-Private Partnership became fully operational in
2015. This office worked to prepare bankable public-private
partnership (PPP) projects in the region, including the largest
PPP in the Philippines’ history.

We made further progress in streamlining procedures for
country strategies, project processing, and procurement. We
delegated more authority to our 31 field offices to improve our
responsiveness on the ground, while our knowledge services
are now geared to provide innovative solutions to client
countries.

As we approach our 50th anniversary in 2016, ADB is
committed to scaling up our operations, and achieving poverty
reduction and sustainable development for Asia and the
Pacific. We will be a stronger, better, and faster organization
by deepening our partnerships with member countries, other
international financial institutions, and civil society.

he Board of Directors provides strategic direction

to ADB. It approves policies, loans, grants, equity

investments, and guarantees, while ensuring that
ADB shareholder guidance is implemented.

In March, the Board of Directors moved to make more
development assistance available to countries most in
need by endorsing the proposal to merge the lending
operations of the Asian Development Fund with the
institution’s ordinary capital resources. The Board of
Governors considered and approved this proposal

in April.

The Board considered a number of reforms resulting
from the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.

In January, by supporting a faster approval process

for small, nonsovereign transactions, the Board helped
to free up financing for frontier economies and pave
the way for inclusive business opportunities. The Board

4 ANNUAL REPORT 2015

also approved a proposal to align the results framework with
the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 in the same month.

In September, the Board agreed to undertake the
development of a new corporate strategy to guide ADB’s
expanded operations up to 2030.

Other major policy and strategic issues that the Board

was involved in 2015 included a new approach to ADB
engagement with upper-middle-income countries, and
operational plans for health, and agriculture and natural
resources. The Board also considered ADB climate
financing and the framework for capital adequacy to ensure
efficient use of ADB’s capital for lending operations.

THE ROLE OF THE BOARD

The Board approves work programs and budget frameworks,
and oversees the salaries and benefits of staff. It reviews andendorses ADB’s annual financial statements, the budget,
and the allocation of net income for approval by the Board
of Governors at each annual meeting.

The Board meets as often as required to manage the
business of ADB. In 2015, it held 35 formal meetings and
37 informal meetings, seminars, and briefings.

The Board approved $16.44 billion in loans, grants, equity
investments, guarantees, and technical assistance during
2015.

COMMITTEE SUPPORT

The Board’s work is supported by six committees: Audit,
Budget Review, Compliance Review, Development
Effectiveness, Ethics, and Human Resources. These
committees meet several times throughout the year,
providing guidance to Management and the Board on issues
affecting ADB operations and administration.

During 2015, committees devoted significant time to
ADB staffing issues and made relevant recommendations
to the Board. The Audit Committee commenced a review
of ADB’s recruitment process, while the Budget Review
and Human Resources committees held joint meetings to
evaluate the ADB workforce.

The two committees analyzed staff workloads and reviewed
compensation and benefits. Committee members noted the
need to map current staff skills and to identify skills gaps in
priority areas. The Board supported measures to optimize
human resources and maximize opportunities at ADB.
These measures include retraining and reskilling existing
staff, being more flexible about redeploying staff, and
managing staff numbers

and positions.

COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP

The Board places special emphasis on engaging with
ADB members and other bilateral and multilateral
development partners. It receives visiting delegations at
ADB headquarters in Manila. Through an informal forum
called the Board Colloquium, the Board meets visiting
ADB governors, alternate governors, and eminent visitors
to ADB.

During the year, the Board welcomed to ADB headquarters
the alternate governors of Japan and Malaysia. It hosted
the executive secretary of the United Nations Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, discussing
thedevelopment agenda and financing options for

the region beyond 2015. In November, the Board had
constructive talks with a delegation from the Board of the
World Bank on its visit to the Philippines.

 

BOARD VISITS
FIJIAND
KIRIBATI

A Board group
visited Fiji and
Kiribati in March.
The group visited
ADB-funded roads,
and water and
sanitation projects.
They also met with
senior government
officials, private
sector and

civil society
representatives,
and development
partners to

gain a greater
understanding of
country needs,
development
experiences, and
opportunities for
better partner
coordination.

  

The Board also undertakes missions
to ADB member countries. Group
visits involve a number of Board
members visiting particular countries
to observe ADB operations, and to
discuss development challenges and
priorities with government officials,
other development partners, business
and community groups, and people
who benefit from projects funded by
ADB. Consultations involve Board
members visiting the countries they
represent for discussions with their
governments.

In March, a group of Board members
visited Fiji and Kiribati (see box),
while in May another group visited
the People’s Republic of China and
Mongolia. Board members met with
government ministers and officials,
as well as representatives from other
development partners, the private
sector, nongovernment organizations,
and civil society. They also visited

the sites of projects funded by ADB.
In September, the Board made

a special visit to Japan and the
Republic of Korea. Unlike the visits to
developing member countries, where
the focus is generally on financing
and operations, this visit focused on
collaboration, knowledge sharing,
and lessons learned from recent
development experiences.

During 2015, the Board endorsed
country partnership strategies for
Armenia, Georgia, Pakistan, and
Papua New Guinea. These country
partnership strategies outline

how ADB will help achieve the
objectives of a country’s national
development plan.

In 2015, loan and grant disbursements (OCR, ADF, and other special funds for
grants) totaled $12.22 billion, an increase of $2.22 billion (22%) from 2014.

AVAILABLE RESOURCES

Authorized and subscribed capital stock amounted to $147.55 billion and
$147.05 billion, respectively. Other resources in OCR—revenue and net realized
gains—amounted to $1.09 billion. Of this total, ADB generated $677.73 million
from its loan portfolio, $365.44 million from the investment portfolio, and

$42.81 million from equity investments and other sources. Resources in ADB’s
Special Funds—contributions and revenue—totaled about $812.37 million. These
mainly included the Asian Development Fund of $699.70 million, the Technical
Assistance Special Fund of $78.19 million, the Asian Development Bank Institute
of $12.61 million, the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund of $20 million, and the
Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund of $1.66 million.

In 2015, ADB raised $18.95 billion in medium- and long-term funds through
public bond issues ($16.67 billion) and private placements ($2.28 billion). Public
offerings included five global benchmark bonds denominated in US dollars and
worth $9.25 billion.

Among the highlights of capital market activity in 2015, ADB issued its first

green bond of $500 million, its inaugural Georgian lari bond amounting to
GEL100 million ($49.26 million equivalent), and a Canadian dollar maple issue
amounting to C$500 million ($399.30 million equivalent). ADB also issued a dual
tranche in the Australian dollar market comprising a new issue of A$700 million
($568.68 million equivalent) and a tap of A$350 million ($284.34 million
equivalent). This was followed by another tap of A$500 million ($364.65 million
equivalent). ADB continued to issue bonds related to particular sectors, raising
$177.27 million from its sale of water bonds.

ADB also raised $4.08 billion in 2015 (compared with $2.42 billion in 2014) as
short-term funds under its Euro-Commercial Paper (ECP) Program. Of the ECPs
issued in 2015, $1.32 billion was outstanding as of 31 December 2015.

incidence of poverty continues to fall at record rates,
development goals are becoming more ambitious
and the outcomes more closely scrutinized.

T he development landscape is changing. While the

Between 1990 and 2012, more than a billion people in Asia
and the Pacific were lifted out of extreme poverty. Most
countries in the region have since achieved middle-income
status and their citizens now enjoy a better quality of life.
The immediate outlook for Asia and the Pacific is also
positive. Although economic growth has slowed from a
high of 9.4% in 2010, the region is expected to post stable
growth of about 5.7% for the next 2 years.

Despite these admirable achievements, half of the world’s
poorest people still live in Asia and the Pacific. In October
2015, the international poverty line was adjusted to $1.90
a day, in 2011 purchasing power parity. Using this measure,
about 451 million people in Asia and the Pacific, or one

in every eight people, were still living in extreme poverty

in 2012. The region also faces entrenched inequality,
substantial infrastructure gaps, inadequate public services,
and significant environmental risks.

There are also downside economic factors looming for Asia
and the Pacific. Lower global commodity prices, declining
trade due to slower growth in the People’s Republic of
China (PRC), reduced remittances, financial volatility,

and pressure on exchange rates may affect the region’s
prospects.

At the same time, international development objectives

are undergoing profound changes. In September 2015,

the international community adopted a new global
development agenda—the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs)—which underscores the need for greater inclusion,
more attention to climate change, promoting sustainable
development, and ending poverty in all its forms.

The momentum of change continued in December when a
new climate deal was forged during the 21st Conference of
Parties on Climate Change (COP21) in Paris. In a showing
of unprecedented solidarity, 195 countries signed a legally
binding agreement to keep global warming below 2°C.
This will require massive support for international climate
financing and technical assistance.

ADB IN THE NEW DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

ADB is fully committed to playing a central role in financing
the SDGs and supporting the COP21 agreement.

In July 2015, ADB joined other multilateral development
banks for the Third International Conference on Financing
for Development in Addis Ababa. The conference
produced a renewed commitment to bolster financial
support, technical assistance, and policy advice to back the
new global development agenda.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 9ADB IS FULLY COMMITTED TO
PLAYING A CENTRAL ROLE

IN FINANCING THE SDGs AND
SUPPORTING THE COP21 AGREEMENT

To deliver on this commitment, ADB is scaling up its capacity
to meet new development challenges. The most significant
move in this process is the approval in April of the merger of
ADB’s concessional Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan
portfolio with its ordinary capital resources (OCR) balance
sheet, effective January 2017. Combining these resources will
almost triple ADB’s equity base from about $17.5 billion to
about $49 billion. A major benefit of the merger is that ADB
will be able to increase assistance to developing member
countries (DMCs) by up to 50%. ADB assistance to lowerincome countries—those most in need—will rise by up

to 70% by 2026. While the merger will become effective

in January 2017, ADB has already started to scale up its
operations. In 2015, OCR and ADF loan and grant approvals
reached a record $16.29 billion, compared with $13.49 billion
in 2014. Including technical assistance and cofinancing, total
operations were $27.17 billion in 2015.

In October, ADB commenced negotiations with donors to
replenish the ADF (11th replenishment) and the Technical
Assistance Fund (6th replenishment). For the ADF, ADB has
reached agreements with donors on strategic priorities for
the 2017-2020 replenishment period—the first following the
merger of concessional funds with OCR—and changes to the
allocation mechanism to better serve the needs of recipient
countries, especially small and fragile countries.

As well as providing larger volumes of financing, ADB intends
to play a greater role in helping countries to use their own
resources. It is strengthening its collaboration with other
development partners, including new multilateral finance
institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment
Bank (AIIB) and the New Development Bank. ADB has
already started identifying potential cofinancing projects
with AIIB in such areas as transport, renewable energy, urban
infrastructure, and water supply.

ADB is also undergoing internal reforms to support the
scaling up of operations. Following the approval of the
Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 Action Plan in 2014, ADB
began making comprehensive operational and organizational

changes to streamline business processes and improve its
effectiveness.

STRATEGIC FOCUS: EMBRACING A BETTER FUTURE
FOR ALL

In 2015, ADB continued to strive for inclusive economic
growth across Asia and the Pacific. It invested ina

range of programs and projects to create and expand
economic opportunities, ensure broader access to these
opportunities—especially for the poor and disadvantaged—
and support social protection to reduce poverty and
vulnerability. For instance, in India, a $273 million road
project will create economic opportunities for people in
selected rural states, by enhancing their access to markets
and other centers of socioeconomic activity. In April, ADB
revised its Guidelines on Inclusive Economic Growth to
help ensure that each of its country partnership strategies
adequately reflects how it will support inclusive economic
growth. ADB drives social protection by ensuring access

to essential services for disadvantaged people, including
widows, the jobless, children in poor households, and people
with disabilities. In Mongolia, a $150 million investment will
help sustain financing for social welfare programs while the
government reforms these programs. ADB is investing in aADB’S RECORD
LOAN AND GRANT
APPROVALS IN 2015

host of other projects to help expand health and education
to disadvantaged people, bridge gender gaps, and deepen
financial inclusion.

ADB is committed to environmentally sustainable
growth in Asia and the Pacific. In 2015, it approved 65 loan
and grant projects for more than $7 billion, contributing

to environmental sustainability. In June, to address the
interconnected challenges of food security, agriculture,
and environmental sustainability, ADB released its
Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources,
2015-2020. The plan emphasizes the need to improve

the management of natural resources and build climate
resilience. In September—3 months prior to COP21 in
Paris—ADB announced it would double its commitment to
climate finance, with a target of $6 billion in direct climate
investment annually by 2020.

In 2015, ADB invested $3.8 billion—which leveraged
$406 million in cofinancing—for regional cooperation
and integration projects. This was supported by

$94 million of technical assistance. ADB helped finance
road improvement from Eindu to Kawkareik, enhancing
trade between Myanmar and Thailand, and provided
assistance to Samoa and Palau to broaden access to
affordable information and communication technology
services through a submarine cable network. ADB also
helped the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation
Program finalize motor vehicle agreements between
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal and between India,
Myanmar, and Thailand. These agreements will open
routes to greater flows of passengers and freight. ADB is
also preparing its Bank-wide Regional Cooperation and
Integration Operational Plan, 2016-2020. The plan will
address the region’s common challenges by strengthening
connectivity, competitiveness, and cooperation in regional
public goods and collective action through regional policy
dialogue, regional institutions, and regional agreements.

SECTOR HIGHLIGHTS: BALANCING NEEDS
ACROSS THE REGION

ADB invested $2.5 billion in clean energy projects across
Asia and the Pacific in 2015. These investments will result
in 618 megawatts of additional capacity generated from
renewable energy, 4.5 terawatt-hours in electricity savings,
and 24 million tons of carbon dioxide avoided when the
projects are up and running. In 2015, ADB approved the
first results-based loan for the strengthening of Indonesia’s
electricity grid, followed by an industrial energy efficiency
project in the PRC, supported transmission of renewable
energy and regional energy trade in India, and promoted
renewable energy development in the Maldives.

ADB provided $2.8 billion directly to the transport sector
and also to transport components of other sector’s projects
in 2015, with an increasing emphasis on sustainability.

A road safety project in Shaanxi in the PRC will see $200
million invested to introduce safety features expected to

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 11Innovative Thinking Paves
the Way to Scale Up

For over 40 years, low-income developing member
countries of ADB received concessional loans and
grants from the Asian Development Fund (ADF), while
market-based loans were made from ADB’s ordinary
capital resources (OCR).

Anticipating the emergence of the Sustainable
Development Goals and the new thinking behind the
Financing for Development agenda, ADB was already
considering innovative ways to scale up operations to
address evolving development needs.

In April 2015, the ADB Board of Governors and donors
to the ADF unanimously consented to the merger of
the ADF lending operations with the OCR balance
sheets. This innovation allows ADB to leverage its
concessional lending in a manner unique among
multilateral development banks.

The merger increases ADB’s capacity first and
foremost to support lower-income countries while

it is also beneficial for middle-income countries. It
also enhances ADB’s risk-bearing capacity to further
support private sector operations. ADB will be ina
stronger financial position to respond to any future
economic crises and natural disasters. At the same
time, the merger substantially reduces expected
financing contributions from ADF donors.

To support the pursuit of the Sustainable Development
Goals across Asia and the Pacific, the merger will

allow ADB to bolster assistance to developing

member countries in the coming years by as much as
50%. Lower-income countries—those which have
traditionally received ADF loans and grants—will

be the key beneficiaries. ADB assistance to these
countries will rise by up to 70%, from the current level
of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion-$11 billion by 2026.

From 2017 onward, the ADF will focus exclusively on
providing grant assistance to the most debt-distressed
countries in Asia and the Pacific. ADB will provide
concessional and market-based loans from the
expanded OCR balance sheet.

12.) ANNUAL REPORT 2015reduce road fatalities and serious injuries by
25%. In India, ADB invested $273 million ina
rural connectivity program for 6,124 kilometers
of all-weather roads. The project, designed with
participation of local communities, includes
training on road asset management, and provides
employment opportunities to women. In
Bangladesh, ADB approved a $200 million rail
project for new trains and upgrades to the main
lines on the key Dhaka-Chittagong and DhakaKhulna transport corridors.

Over the year, ADB approved more than

$2 billion for urban development projects.

It maintained a focus on inclusive development
and environmentally sustainable cities, to
expand access to public services and improve
mobility. ADB invested $450 million into
projects to improve the urban environment of
selected cities in three provinces of the PRC. The
Urban Financing Partnership Facility allocated
$15 million in financing to about 10 projects.
This financing will improve the environmental
conditions and livability in urban areas, and the
ability of infrastructure to withstand the impacts
of climate change. ADB’s Future Cities Program
will, over a 15-20 year period, engage with select
cities to develop planning principles that improve
livability.

ADB committed $2.2 billion to water projects
across the water and other infrastructure and
services sector; agriculture, natural resources
and rural development sector; and energy sector
in 2015. The Water Financing Partnership
Facility allocated a further $4.3 million to help
prepare and implement projects. Through these
projects, ADB will help improve the lives of
around 22 million people. The investments will
provide greater access to clean water, increase
the efficiency of irrigation infrastructure to boost
agricultural production, and enhance overall
water security.

 

ADB is responding to demands for education
to be oriented toward the world of work. In
2015, it invested $586 million in eight projects
to broaden support for secondary education

and technical and vocational education and
training (TVET). ADB approved projects to help
rebuild and upgrade schools damaged by the
2015 earthquakes in Nepal and to build schools
with seismic safety in Armenia. It also supported
a project to integrate clean energy and energy
efficiency technologies into TVET in Tajikistan.
ADB organized two regional forums in 2015; one
in Azerbaijan to support a transition to a 12-year
education system, another in Beijing to improve

the quality and relevance of multi-level TVET and
higher education.

ADB support for the finance sector across Asia

and the Pacific rose 109% from $1.1 billion in 2014

to $2.3 billion in 2015. It concentrated operations

on finance sector development—money and

capital markets—infrastructure, and investments.
These were complemented by support for sound

and efficient legal and regulatory frameworks and
good governance. To promote inclusive growth

and explore new investment opportunities, ADB
convened forums highlighting the importance of
remittances for development finance; holistic policy
approaches for diversified micro, small, and mediumsized enterprise financing models; and innovative
approaches to disaster risk financing. ADB also
continued its regional financial cooperation and
integration efforts in the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) and ASEAN plus the PRC,
Japan, and the Republic of Korea through the ASEAN
Financial Integration Framework and the Asian Bond
Markets Initiative.

Among the major initiatives for health in 2015 were
two projects totaling $323 million—one for a national
urban health mission in India, the other for health
sector governance in the Lao People’s Democratic
Republic (Lao PDR). In June, ADB launched its
Operational Plan for Health, 2015-2020. The plan
outlines how ADB will support DMCs in achieving
universal health coverage. To advance toward the
goal of universal health coverage, ADB and its
development partners contributed $20 million in
technical assistance for malaria and communicable
disease control, elderly care in the PRC, and urban
health in India. ADB also supported better hospital
management practices in Mongolia and improved
air quality in the Philippines. ADB seeks to share
best practices in health and, in 2015, organized
conferences on topics such as eHealth; malaria
elimination and health security; and regulations

to address health sector issues in Bangladesh,
Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao PDR, Mongolia,
Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, and Viet Nam.

In 2015, ADB’s commitment to agriculture

and natural resources comprised $1 billion in
sovereign loans and grants, and $98 million in
nonsovereign investments including projects for
improving financial services outreach for agriculture
($95 million), covering 18 projects in 12 countries,
and $32 million in technical assistance. In addition
to traditional investments to enhance off-farm
productivity and manage natural resources, ADB
diversified its portfolio to respond to the needs

of DMCs. It invested in agribusiness value chains
and logistics, as well as climate change resilience.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 13Through its Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural
Resources, 2015-2020, ADB will work to boost food
productivity, address the impacts of climate change on
agriculture, support small-scale farmers to participate in
modern food value chains, tackle malnutrition, and improve
food security. ADB has also commenced studies on food
security at the country level.

THEMATIC HIGHLIGHTS: BROADENING
THE BENEFITS OF GROWTH

ADB supports projects and programs that empower

women and girls. In 2015, more than half of all ADB
projects—especially in education, water supply, urban
development, and agriculture—had a gender component.
In Myanmar, ADB approved the first private sector project
focused on gender, providing funds for the rollout of a
mobile telecommunication network that will give more

than 5 million women access to the internet and mobile
technology by 2020, and provide mobile applications for
maternal health. In Nepal, ADB supported a governance
program to raise women’s representation in local decisionmaking bodies to 33%. As a result, 35% of the capital budget
for local projects was spent on priority activities identified by
women and disadvantaged groups.

To strengthen good governance, ADB conducted
governance risk assessments in nine countries in 2015. The
assessments covered the agriculture, education, energy,
transport, and water sectors, and ADB identified actions to
overcome governance and institutional capacity challenges.
ADB investments toward good governance in 2015 included
an e-governance solution to digitalize land records in
Bangladesh, and an e-governance master plan to widen
access to public services for the people of Myanmar.

Environmental sustainability is woven into all aspects

of ADB operations through country partnership strategies,
technical assistance, projects, and knowledge. In 2015,
ADB issued its fifth Sustainability Report, which highlights
increased investment in inclusive and environmentally
sustainable growth, as well as efforts to reduce its
corporate environmental footprint by switching to 100%
renewable energy in its headquarters. ADB also became
the first multilateral development bank accredited as

an implementing entity to the Green Climate Fund. In
November, ADB secured $31 million from the Green Climate
Fund to make Fiji’s water sector more climate resilient. The
project will build new infrastructure to increase clean water
supplies by 20% and boost wastewater treatment capacity
by 200% in the greater Suva area, the main metropolitan
center of Fiji, and will benefit a third of the country’s
population of 860,000.

In 2015, ADB invested $3.86 billion in 51 projects that
directly reduced disaster risk, integrated disaster resilience
measures, or supported post-disaster response. In Nepal,
ADB provided immediate funding and expertise to the
government to accelerate recovery and reconstruction

was used to strengthen 160 schools in
Nepal under an ADB-supported project
prior to 2015, all of which withstood the
April earthquake. In September, ADB
provided $89.3 million to help Armenia
build earthquake-resilient schools and
scale up its capacity for responding to
disasters in one of the most earthquakeprone regions in the world. ADB also
replenished the Asia Pacific Disaster
Response Fund by $20 million, providing
humanitarian disaster assistance to
Myanmar, Nepal, and Vanuatu.

institutions. Cofinancing enables ADB
to design projects larger than its own
resources may otherwise allow. In

2015, ADB achieved $27.17 billion in
operations by leveraging $10.74 billion
in cofinancing. ADB extended its
memorandum of understanding (MOU)
on cofinancing arrangements with the
Republic of Korea in May, and with the
Abu Dhabi Fund for Development in
September. These arrangements cover
agriculture, natural resources and rural
development; energy; health; finance;
industry and trade; water and other
urban infrastructure; transport; and
education. In May, ADB and the Kuwait
Fund For Arab Economic Development
signed an MOU to strengthen
institutional partnerships. In November,
ADB and Japan announced a $16 billion
partnership over the next 5 years,

to boost support for private
infrastructure projects and promote
quality public infrastructure
development in the region.

Tapping private sector resources is
crucial to meeting the SDGs for Asia
and the Pacific. In 2015, to encourage
public-private partnerships (PPPs)to finance, build, and operate much-needed public assets
and services, ADB helped adopt or enact PPP legal and
regulatory measures in Viet Nam (February), the PRC
(April), Bangladesh (September), and Nepal (October).
ADB also made progress on establishing several facilities
that will help prepare PPP projects. These facilities
included the Project Development and Monitoring Facility
in the Philippines, which successfully awarded more

than $1.5 billion in PPP projects during 2015. In May,

ADB announced that Japan, Canada, and Australia had
contributed $73 million to support the Asia Pacific Project
Preparation Facility, a multi-donor trust fund managed

by ADB to help developing Asia and the Pacific prepare,
structure, and place bankable PPP projects. Together with
the Development Bank of the Philippines, ADB will advise
on the largest transaction in the country’s PPP program, the
North-South Railway, to convert the railway’s South Line
into a dynamic commuter and long-haul service corridor.
Other initiatives to make progress in 2015 included the first
PPP in Mongolia, a $1.5 billion combined heat and power
plant, and the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India
natural gas pipeline project.

Recognizing the vital need for external resources to scale
up its scope of activity, ADB private sector operations
leveraged $4.56 billion of external cofinancing in 2015,
which compares favorably with ADB’s own private sector
investments of $2.63 billion. Out of this, ADB attracted
$2.61 billion in cofinancing through B-loan syndications
and parallel cofinancing. ADB’s Trade Finance Program also
generated over $1.42 billion of commercial cofinancing to
supplement continued efforts by ADB to close financing
gaps through guarantees and loans to banks to stimulate
cross-border trade.

  
 

ADB Plays a Leading Role
on Climate Change

ADB has a long and impressive record on tackling climate
change and in 2015 it committed to expanding this.

In September 2015, ADB President Takehiko Nakao
announced that ADB will double its annual climate
financing to $6 billion by 2020. This means that ADB
spending on climate change issues will rise to about 30%
of its total financing by the end of this decade.

Of the $6 billion, $4 billion will be dedicated to climate
change mitigation, by scaling up support for renewable
energy, energy efficiency, sustainable transport, and
building smart cities. The remaining $2 billion will be
committed to climate change adaptation, through more
resilient infrastructure, climate-smart agriculture, and
better preparation for climate-related disasters.

With this decision ADB will get a good head start
on supporting the global agreement reached at the
21st Conference of Parties of the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21),
held in Paris in December.

With 195 countries committed to taking action to limit
the global mean temperature rise to “well below 2 degrees
Celsius” above the pre-industrial average, while “pursuing
efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees
Celsius,” ADB stands ready to help its developing member
countries fulfill the legally binding Paris agreement.

ADB continues to develop innovative mechanisms to
scale up climate financing from both the private and public
sectors, and to help developing Asia and the Pacific access
global climate funds, including the Green Climate Fund.
The Climate Change Strategic Action Framework, planned
for 2016, will consolidate and advance ADB climate
strategies and actions.

 

ADB is sharpening its approach to knowledge
management by preparing national knowledge

plans to meet the needs of each DMC, with 10 such
plans prepared during 2015. In May, ADB held its first
Knowledge Partnership Week, aimed at promoting
innovation through collaboration with think tanks and
the private sector. This led to an agreement for ADB to
collaborate with the World Resources Institute and the
Cooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities
on the flagship topic of Future Cities (2050) in Asia, and
produced a partnership with the Center of Excellence for
Renewable Energy in Indonesia.

the continued economic slowdown of the region’s

major trading partners in 2015. The slump in global
commodity prices also affected the region, with diminishing
export revenues and shrinking remittances from commodityexporting countries such as the Russian Federation.

C ountries in Central and West Asia were affected by

The severe recession in the Russian Federation meant

fewer employment opportunities for migrant workers from
countries such as Armenia, Georgia, the Kyrgyz Republic,
and Tajikistan. The result was lower remittances for these
countries, especially given the steep depreciation of the
ruble against other currencies, leading to reduced disposable
income and private consumption.

 

Pakistan benefited from lower prices for oil, which accounts
for almost a third of its imports, yet the country’s economy
failed to achieve its growth potential. This was due to weak
performance in exports, caused by structural issues such as
a lack of diversification and supporting infrastructure in the
manufacturing sector.

16 ANNUAL REPORT 2015

 

Economic activity in Afghanistan was again impeded by
uncertainty around the country’s political and security
situation. The government struggled to deliver on anticipated
reforms, keeping investor and consumer confidence low.

The region’s energy exporters—Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan—were hit by a significant
drop in commodity revenues. This weakened the current
account balances in these countries, putting downward
pressure on their currencies. Their economic growth is
likely to be further affected by reduced private investment
in commodity enterprises, fewer public investments due
to lower expected revenues from oil exports, and lower
consumption of imported goods (due to weaker exchange
rates).

Kazakhstan floated its currency, and the tenge depreciated
significantly. While the lower value of the tenge could lead to
improved export competitiveness in the long term, the float
has increased prices for imported nonfood goods, which are
difficult to substitute with local products.A Focus on Building a Better Region

After doubling in size over the past 5 years, the ADB portfolio in Central and West Asia
reached $20 billion in 2015. ADB aims to further strengthen its position in promoting
economic diversity, enhancing regional connectivity, improving cross-border economic
corridors, enhancing delivery of public services, and managing climate change. These
ambitions will build up the forward-looking 3-year pipeline of approvals by 21.6% and
will require increased resources—and close coordination with development partners.

¢ Infrastructure. The infrastructure portfolio is projected to account for almost 80%
of ADB approvals during 2016-2018. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, ADB will focus
on increasing energy access and developing off-grid systems with renewable energy
technologies. ADB will expand transport corridors in the region and rehabilitate
secondary roads, particularly in Georgia. This will increase access to jobs, markets,
and basic social services, particularly for the vulnerable and the poor. ADB will take
a holistic approach to water supply and sanitation in intermediate cities and rural
areas, using a combination of low-cost, adaptive, and decentralized solutions.

* Regional Cooperation and Integration. Growing regional cooperation and
integration investments under the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation
(CAREC) Program will enhance physical connectivity in all CAREC countries;
improve trade policy in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic; and streamline trade
across the borders of the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. ADB’s flagship
initiative for regional cooperation and integration, the Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan—
Tajikistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan power interconnection, will enable about
900 gigawatt-hours to be supplied to Afghanistan by 2019.

* Inclusive Growth. ADB promotes inclusive growth by expanding economic
opportunities and ensuring broader sharing of the benefits. ADB intends to scale
up its measures in health, education, governance, and business and finance, which
represent almost 20% of planned approvals during 2016-2018.

 

OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS resulting in a budget deficit that needed to be addressed

350 businesses in Djizzak, Uzbekistan.

In Pakistan, ADB approved $1 billion for projects to improve
transport and trade. ADB is helping upgrade 328 kilometers
of provincial highways in Sindh, and is funding a motorway
connecting Pakistan’s textile- producing hub, Faisalabad, with
Multan, the major trade center in southern Punjab. Another
project will construct modern border infrastructure and
facilities at Charman and Torkham—the two main transit
points for trade with Afghanistan—as well as in Wagha, the
only open land route connecting South Asia to Central Asia.
Through technical assistance, ADB will also help Pakistan
develop a national transport policy, improve road safety,
enhance road asset management, and facilitate international
transport.

In June, ADB approved a financing advance for project
design to the Kyrgyz Republic for a connector road that is
part of major corridors being constructed under the Central
Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program.
This is the first time ADB has provided project design
advance financing to a country in Central and West Asia. It
will support set-up costs and the detailed engineering design
of the connector road.

 

NEW DIRECTIONS IN KNOWLEDGE SHARING

In 2015, ADB funded or supported a variety of knowledgesharing initiatives across Central and West Asia, focusing on
energy, the environment, and transport.

In April, senior transport officials from CAREC countries
participated in knowledge-sharing workshops in Mongolia.
Funded by ADB, the workshops covered road asset
management and cross-border transport facilitation. ADB
also held two technical workshops to reboot a dormant
traffic agreement between the People’s Republic of China,

the first meeting of the CAREC Railway Working Group was
held in Japan to begin preparing a regional strategy. ADB
supported the Silk Road Forum in Georgia, which discussed
economic cooperation along the Silk Road trade corridor and
was attended by over 800 participants from 60 countries.

ADB produced a publication on developing water resource
strategies in Tajikistan to help the country’s government
address chronic food insecurity and poverty. In October,
ADB also helped the government organize a symposium
on access to green finance. The symposium promoted the
marketing, financing, and public awareness of green energy
solutions across Tajikistan.

In Kazakhstan, ADB backed the Knowledge and Experience

Exchange Program, a forum to find ways to improve financing :

for small and medium-sized enterprises.

COOPERATING TOWARD
VITAL GOALS

In December, ADB approved a
multitranche financing facility for
energy development in Afghanistan,
which includes projects for
renewable energy generation, and
reinforcement of power transmission
and distribution networks.

The first tranche project will increase
power imports by constructing

the last link in Turkmenistan and
Afghanistan’s power interconnection.
ADB also approved a project

to rehabilitate 87 kilometers of
highways in Uzbekistan, to improve
travel time.

Recognizing that the number of
people killed or seriously injured

on roads in Central and West Asia
was significant by international
standards, the 14th CAREC
Ministerial Conference endorsed a
formal commitment to road safety.
This commitment sets out 10 actions
for a consistent approach to road
safety across the region. ADB also
supported road safety awareness
campaigns in Mongolia and Georgia.

In September, the CAREC Program
finalized and adopted a strategy and
work plan to promote clean energy
technologies across the region during
2016-2018.

EXTENDING THE BENEFITS

ADB is committed to expanding
opportunities for the people of
Central and West Asia, particularly
women and the poor.

In Afghanistan, where most of the
poor depend on agriculture to make a
living, an ADB grant of $77.5 million
is helping to store crops safely,
reducing losses after harvest and
increasing incomes from farming.

In Azerbaijan, ADB is providing a
$600 million financing facility to
rehabilitate water and sanitation
systems in small towns and semi-‘S
SON

urban areas. Poor rural communities will also have better
access to services, thanks to a loan of $500 million to
develop roads, including upgrades to the Baku-Astara
Highway.

In Georgia, as well as investing in a sustainable urban
transport program, ADB has committed $500 million

to deliver safe water and functioning sewerage systems

in Anaklia, Kutaisi, Marneuli, Mestia, Poti, Ureki, and
Zugdidi between 2011-2018. Following the approval

of $200 million for a multiyear policy-based program

to increase savings and domestic resources, create
investment opportunities, and support capital market and
pension reforms in Georgia, ADB approved a subprogram
of $75 million in September.

In Kazakhstan, ADB is providing a loan of $228 million—
distributed through local banks and a state-owned
entrepreneurship development fund—to develop small
businesses, particularly those located outside major cities
and owned by women entrepreneurs.

A GREENER WAY FORWARD

In 2015, ADB approved nine projects related to
environmental sustainability in the region.

In Armenia, ADB is working to provide urban transport
with better traffic safety and efficiency, and less
pollution, while enhancing the local economy in Yerevan.

A power transmission project in the northwest region
of Uzbekistan is helping improve the country’s energy
efficiency, while ADB work in Pakistan continues to
improve water resource management; increase the

A More Energized Azerbaijan

  

Less than a decade ago, there was a serious lack of sufficient
power, gas, and heating in rural areas of Azerbaijan. Some
areas received only a few hours of electricity a day, and there
were frequent localized outages and occasional widespread
system failures.

As well as affecting daily life, the unreliable electricity
supply inhibited industrial, agricultural, and commercial
activities, limiting economic growth and employment
opportunities.

In 2008, ADB committed $160 million for a long-term
project to enhance power transmission across Azerbaijan.
Having completed its assessment of the project in 2015,
ADB found that electricity supply increased by about 23%
between 2010 and 2014, power losses through transmission
lines halved from 2007 to 2014, and annual net carbon
dioxide emissions reduced by 0.06 million tons.

ADB support has helped to upgrade the backbone
of Azerbaijan’s power transmission network—the lines
linking Mingachevir to the Absheron region, which includes
Baku. There are now 344 kilometers of new 220-kilovolt
transmission lines, as well as two new and six upgraded
substations, ensuring a stable supply of energy to key
Azeri industrial and economic hubs on the Absheron
Peninsula. This supply is expected to benefit about 1 million
households.

With a strengthened power transmission network and
stable electricity supply, the country can enjoy improved
household living standards and job creation through small
and medium-sized enterprises. Azerbaijan can also look to
increase its power trade with neighboring countries.

productivity of irrigated agriculture; and provide social
recovery from floods in Punjab province and the northern
districts of Haveli, Kotli, and Poonch.

Through a grant cofinanced by the Clean Energy Fund,
ADB is also supporting an education and training
project to integrate clean energy and energy efficiency
technologies in Tajikistan.

he economy of the People’s Republic of China

(PRC) expanded by 6.9% in 2015. The moderation

in growth was mainly due to a shrinking labor force
and excess production capacity, as the economy transitions
from construction to consumption as its main driver. This
adjustment will benefit the economy and the environment
by requiring fewer resources, but it is placing considerable
pressure on enterprises and industries. Poverty and income
inequality between regions of the PRC remain high despite
government efforts to address them.

In Mongolia, the economy grew by 2.3% in 2015, with the
country facing serious challenges following years of highly
expansionary macroeconomic policies. Foreign direct
investment declined by 71% in the first three quarters of the
year. The country’s debt now accounts for almost 84% of
gross domestic product, with major debt repayments due
during 2017-2018. The Government of Mongolia is pushing
ahead with major mining projects to spur growth and address

a persistent balance-of-payments problem. While mining
remains a major source of growth, it creates few jobs and
the government is diversifying the economy to broaden
employment.

OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

In 2015, ADB provided $2 billion for 16 loans and grants

to East Asia, as well as $38.8 million for 50 technical assistance
projects. Lending and grant assistance, supplemented

with $254 million in cofinancing, were distributed across the
sectors of agriculture, natural resources and rural development
(30%); energy (26%); water and other urban infrastructure
and services (15%); transport (10%); education (7%); public
sector management (7%); finance (3%); and industry and
trade (1%).

In 2015, ADB assistance to the PRC totaled $1.73 billion for
12 projects in urban and road infrastructure, agriculture and
natural resources, climate change, and education.SCALING UP

 

Ready to Broaden the Base of Development

Following record lending of $2 billion in 2015, ADB operations in East Asia are
expected to expand further. ADB will intensify its efforts to diversify the region’s
economies, manage natural resources, and make urbanization more inclusive and
environmentally friendly.

* Climate Change and Environment. To promote low-carbon development, ADB
will scale up investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy. It will invest
$150 million in a smart energy transmission line to support a new power plant in
Mongolia. In the People’s Republic of China (PRC), $1.5 billion will be committed
over the next 3 years to support coordinated investment in clean energy, public
transport, and the use of renewable energy in rural areas. Protecting river basins,
particularly the Tuul River in Mongolia and the Yangtze River in the PRC, will be
another priority.

¢ Inclusive Growth and Social Protection. ADB will address inequality and
regional disparities by investing in Mongolia’s poor ger (traditional tent) areas
and focusing its lending on the poor in less developed regions of the PRC. ADB
will further support social protection in Mongolia to mitigate falling government
expenditure on social programs. Investing in education, addressing infrastructure
gaps in regional cities, and making finance more accessible to small and mediumsized enterprises are all important parts of the inclusive growth strategy for
Mongolia.

* Policy Support and Development Partnership. In Mongolia, ADB will provide a
$35 million technical assistance loan to help improve the corporate governance of a
state-owned enterprise that manages national assets and infrastructure. In the PRC,
ADB will help implement an ADB-PRC memorandum of understanding for climate
change initiatives. ADB will also support regionally coordinated master plans for
clean air and river basin protection, fiscal reforms, public-private partnerships, and

 

ADB provided $450 million for three projects in Jiangxi
province and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which will
expand urban infrastructure, manage solid waste, supply clean
water, control environmental pollution, and reduce flooding.
ADB is supporting road infrastructure in Shaanxi province
with a $200 million loan to improve road safety, reducing
road deaths and serious injuries by about 25% by 2019.

ADB approved two projects worth $230 million in Hubei and
Hunan provinces in September and November, respectively,
to help improve water supply and rehabilitate ecosystems
through improved pollution control and flood management.
ADB also supported two projects totaling $169 million in
Henan and Gansu provinces to help secure food safety

and boost agricultural production through better access

to finance.

In the fight to control air pollution, ADB approved its
first-ever policy-based loan to the PRC. It committed

a market-based approach to natural resource conservation.

$300 million—supplemented by technical assistance

of $2.3 million and cofinancing of $167 million from the
German development bank KfW—to help reduce air
pollution in the Beijing-Tianjin—Hebei region. Through
another loan of $100 million, ADB will also help cut
emissions of more than 14 million tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent per year, and support the phasing out of
mercury use in the chemical industry.

In December, ADB provided the PRC its first resultsbased loan of $150 million to help Guizhou province
upgrade practical training facilities, develop a curriculum
aligned with the needs of industry, train teachers

and school managers, and strengthen education
management.

In Mongolia, ADB provided $275 million for three

projects and one policy-based loan to support the poor,
help diversify the economy, and create jobs.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 21More Power, Less Pollution
in Guangdong

The lights are on in Nanhai District, Foshan City—and life has
become brighter for its residents.

The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is the world’s
largest energy consumer, and many provinces struggle to cope
with power shortages, pollution, and environmental damage
caused by burning fossil fuels. Through a unique partnership
with the central and provincial governments, ADB funded
a program to provide additional power capacity in the PRC,
without adding to pollution, through an efficiency power plant
(EPP). By saving energy, an EPP improves energy security
because less new power supply is needed to meet future
demand and less coal is used for power generation.

Guangdong province, home to 92 million people and the
PRC’s largest provincial economy, was chosen as the best site.

The ADB investment helped upgrade or replace motors,
steam recovery systems, steelmaking equipment, and
water pumps with new energy-efficient technologies. It
also provided retrofitting streets, hospitals, schools, and
government buildings with new light-emitting diode (LED)
lighting solutions. When the program was finally completed
in 2013, it created annual energy savings of 1,212 gigawatthours, equal to the electricity consumed by over 195,000
PRC households for 1 year. The reduction in greenhouse
emissions is the same as not burning 399,891 tons of coal
yearly.

The program is literally a shining example of
environmentally sustainable development, and it can be seen
in the 15,000 streetlights of Nanhai District, Foshan City.

ADB approved $50 million for the second phase of an
agriculture and rural development project in September
for Mongolia’s underutilized agricultural resources. The
project aims to create and promote agribusinesses and
cooperatives, and develop Mongolian food brands. In
November, ADB also committed $60 million to help small
and medium-sized enterprises gain access to finance and
create jobs in sectors other than mining.

UNITING TO SOLVE CHALLENGES

ADB knowledge-sharing activities in East Asia again
focused on interacting with regional cooperation programs
and facilitating policy and institutional reforms.

In May, ADB invited officials from Greater Mekong
Subregion (GMS) countries to Yunnan province in the

22 ANNUAL REPORT 2015

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

PRC to discuss urbanization and common development
challenges. In August, a knowledge-sharing event with
Mongolia, held at ADB headquarters, focused on natural
resource management and related macroeconomic policy
reforms. In December, more than 100 policy makers,
practitioners, and industry experts shared experiences and
lessons learned in social assistance under the ADB-PRC
Knowledge Sharing Platform held in Beijing.

Other knowledge-sharing activities throughout 2015
covered public finance, aging and elderly care, carbon
capture and storage, lakes and wetlands protection, and
transport infrastructure.

COOPERATION OPENS DOORS TO TRADE

ADB support contributed to notable achievements under
the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC)
Program in 2015.

To support the joint customs control initiative between the
PRC and Mongolia, ADB backed training workshops for the
customs officers of both countries. ADB also gave a loan

of $15 million to strengthen Mongolia’s capacity to control
cross-border transmission of animal and plant diseases.

ADB provided two loans totaling $300 million to the

PRC to facilitate trade and investment with other CAREC
member countries. The loans are funding improvements
to key infrastructure in border and corridor cities in the
PRC’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. In Mongolia,
the first phase of the new international road corridor
linking the country’s isolated western regions to the PRC
and the Russian Federation was successfully completed in
November; in the same month, the road section in Khovdprovince was inaugurated. Work on the second phase in
Bayan-Olgii province began in August.

In June, under the GMS framework, ADB and the PRC

jointly hosted the Seventh GMS Economic Corridors Forum :

and the Governors’ Forum, held in Kunming in Yunnan
province. At these meetings, GMS member countries
agreed on measures to further develop cross-border
transport, trade, and investment.

BUILDING MORE INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES

ADB is promoting inclusive growth in East Asia through
a combination of infrastructure development and social
protection initiatives.

In Hubei province in the PRC, ADB supported the opening
of an 18-kilometer bus rapid transit (BRT) route through
Yichang’s most congested roadways. This is providing

affordable, faster public transport for 5,400 passengers per :
hour each way, improving access to economic opportunities :

and social services for the city’s underserved.

ADB support in the PRC is also working to improve the
number and quality of homes and facilities for the care

of disadvantaged elderly people; improve the capacity

of social workers to deal with social welfare recipients;
improve technical and vocational education and training
for poor communities in Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou
provinces; and strengthen support for preparing university
graduates for employment.

A new citywide BRT network in Ulaanbaatar will provide
low-income areas with access to good quality public
transport. ADB is also implementing two projects that will
provide clean water, sewerage, and heating connections
to 109,938 poor households in 13 rural towns across
Mongolia.

To expand access to formal schooling, ADB supported
education reforms in Mongolia, which were completed in
2015. The reforms involved lowering the school entry age
from 7 years to 6 years and extending education from
grade 11 to grade 12. The results of the reforms are
encouraging: about 98% of the Mongolia’s 6-year-olds
enrolled in school, and 99% of 11th grade students
successfully transitioned to grade 12.

Through a policy-based loan of $150 million approved

in October, ADB will support policy reforms to ensure
continued delivery of social welfare programs, such as
food stamps or cash transfers, for Mongolia’s most
vulnerable during ongoing economic difficulties.

the river basin, ADB made a series
of investments in water supply
management, wastewater treatment,
solid waste management, and
capacity development. More than
80% of wastewater in the project’s
catchment area is now collected and
treated, contributing to a dramatic
improvement in water quality and
supply.

ADB is also addressing similar issues
in the Yangtze River Basin around
Nanjing. ADB funding to support
wastewater management has
improved water quality, and improved
storm water drainage has reduced
flooding.

ADB supports the PRC’s climate
change initiatives and its transition to
a low-carbon economy. In September,
ADB and the Hunan Provincial
Government signed a memorandum
of understanding to promote

climate technology development

and deployment in the province. In
December, ADB approved a project
in Qingdao that will use natural

gas, solar thermal, shallow-ground
geothermal, and waste heat recovered
from industrial plants to heat, cool,
and create electricity. The project

is expected to reduce energy use by
40% and lower carbon emissions by
64% by 2022.

ADB is providing technical assistance
to support Mongolia’s green
development agenda by strengthening
the capacity of national agencies to
balance three key environmentaleconomic accounts: materials flow,
energy, and environmental taxes. The
Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction
provided funding to promote
sustainable forest management in

its sixth consecutive year of economic expansion, but
growth slowed from recent annual highs driven by public
infrastructure spending. In Papua New Guinea (PNG)—
the region’s largest economy—the economic boost from
the country’s first full year of liquefied natural gas exports
was offset by large cuts in public spending and declines in
commodity prices.

D eclining momentum in the Pacific’s larger economies

Some smaller economies in the Pacific were affected by
severe weather. For the first time in over a decade, Vanuatu’s
economy contracted. Damage caused by Cyclone Pam in
March caused losses equal to over 60% of the country’s
gross domestic product. Kiribati and Tuvalu also felt the

economic impact of Cyclone Pam. In the Federated States of

24 ANNUAL REPORT 2015

i

Micronesia, a series of typhoons from March to May

caused damage resulting in contraction for 2015. Other
economies experienced higher growth. In Samoa, Solomon
Islands, and Tonga, economic expansion was driven by postdisaster reconstruction, while the Cook Islands’ economy

was stimulated by development projects, and tourism boomed
in Palau.

 

 

OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

In 2015, ADB approved $177.80 million for 18 loans and grants
(including assistance from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response
Fund) in the Pacific. These approvals, supplemented with
$271.10 million of cofinancing (including cofinancing not
directly administered by ADB), were double the amount of
2014 and were complemented by $19.42 million in technical
assistance for 21 projects. ADB directed the most support

to Timor-Leste ($126.2 million) and PNG ($81.9 million).
The 2015 program focused on transport (64%), informationSCALING UP

 

ADB to Bolster Support for Energy, Water,
and the Environment

The portfolio of active projects supported by ADB in the Pacific doubled from $1 billion
in 2009 to $2 billion by the end of 2014. As of 31 December 2015, the figure for active

 

operations stood at $2.08 billion, and is expected to continue growing in the future.

¢ Infrastructure Development. The ADB infrastructure portfolio in the Pacific is
expected to grow from $1.5 billion in 2015 to more than $2.5 billion by 2018. Land
transport projects will focus on expanding access to services for remote areas,
while maritime sector operations will foster regional connectivity and help bolster
trade. The growth of energy sector operations, particularly projects promoting the
use of renewable energy, is expected to remain high. Work on projects in both the
energy and water and sanitation sectors will include expanding access for the poorer
and underserved communities of the region. Further growth in information and
communication technology is anticipated, with submarine cable projects in Palau,
Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Tonga, and plans to extend to the Cook Islands.

¢ Environment and Climate Change. To help mitigate climate change across the

 

and communication technology (20%), public sector
management (7%), and energy (5%).

In Timor-Leste, ADB provided an additional $76.22 million
to an existing road project, adding 97 kilometers of national
roads to the 81 kilometers already approved to be upgraded
and climate-proofed. To mitigate potential damage

by extreme weather events, the project will construct
oversized drainage structures, concrete roads in vulnerable
locations, and implement bioengineering to control erosion.

In Vanuatu, ADB approved $32.09 million, supplemented
with $7.33 million in cofinancing from New Zealand and
the Global Environment Facility, to improve interisland
shipping services, and to repair and climate-proof transport
infrastructure damaged by Cyclone Pam.

In Kiribati, ADB confirmed $2.4 million, with cofinancing
of $13 million from the World Bank and the Pacific Region

Pacific, ADB expects to invest more than $200 million in renewable energy over the
next 3 years. ADB will also increase assistance for sustainable transport, and these
projects will represent a growing share of the transport portfolio in the Pacific, which is
expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2018. ADB will implement a pilot program for climate
resilience in Papua New Guinea, and provide other support to improve climate risk
management.

¢ Poverty Reduction and Inclusive Growth. Building on ADB’s assistance to the
University of South Pacific, ADB will look beyond constructing school infrastructure
and explore the potential in technical and vocational education in Fiji and TimorLeste. Financial inclusion reforms in Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste will also
enable more women to start businesses on their own. In Tonga, information and
communication technology applications will be developed to ensure that improved
connectivity will support inclusive growth.

Infrastructure Facility (PRIF), to improve the main road in
South Tarawa. ADB is also administering a $290,000 grant
from New Zealand to support the rehabilitation of wharves
and jetties in Solomon Islands.

Climate change adaptation and mitigation considerations
were included in the design of the proposed Fiji Urban
Water Supply and Wastewater Management Project. Grant
funding of $31 million from the Green Climate Fund will be
used for the incremental adaptation costs of this project.

Information and communication technology is a critical
component of the ADB strategy to improve Pacific
island countries’ connections to each other and the rest
of the world. In 2015, ADB provided a $25 million loan
to Palau and Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia,
with $22.5 million in cofinancing from the World Bank;
and a $25 million grant to Samoa, supplemented with
$17.5 million from the World Bank and Australia, to help

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 25connect Pacific countries to a fiber-optic submarine cable
that will deliver affordable broadband internet access
to the public.

ADB supports financial reform to place Pacific island
countries on a more sustainable financial footing. ADB
approved a $2 million grant, with $3 million in cofinancing
from Australia, New Zealand, and the World Bank, to
strengthen fiscal sustainability in Tuvalu. The third phase
of a regional technical assistance project to develop the
Pacific’s private sector is funded by a grant of $8.08 million
from Australia. This phase focuses on sharpening the
competitiveness of the business environment and

the economic empowerment of women. It backed a
$24.25 million grant from the Strategic Climate Fund to help
PNG make its development investments climate resilient.

From October to December, ADB provided $1.44 million
in additional financing—with $16.61 million from Australia,
New Zealand, Denmark, and the European Union—

to develop and maintain renewable energy in Samoa and
Tonga, and for electricity supply security and sustainability
in Nauru. Additional financing of $4.77 million from

New Zealand was also provided to PNG to rehabilitate a
hydropower plant and extend distribution grids, which will
deliver power to about 2,500 households.

Through a grant of $5 million, with $4 million in cofinancing
from Australia, ADB is helping provide safe water and
sanitation to about 1,250 households on the island of Ebeye,
Marshall Islands. In response to the damage caused by
Cyclone Pam in Vanuatu, $1 million from the Asia Pacific
Disaster Response Fund and $5 million from the Japan

Fund for Poverty Reduction provided emergency support to
rebuild schools for at least 1,200 students in Talea province;
provide medical kits, food, and drinking water to the affected
population; and restore damaged communication and
transport links. Australia also committed $2.85 million in aid,
administered by ADB, to assist PNG in providing improved
lending services to micro and small enterprises in the
country.

LINKING TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY

ADB strengthened its knowledge-sharing program across
the Pacific in 2015.

In July, ADB published Aid for Trade in Asia and the Pacific:
Thinking Forward About Trade Costs and the Digital Economy.
A special section on the Pacific looks at how entrepreneurs
throughout the region have overcome high trade costs to link
into the global economy. The report also considers how

aid for trade has contributed to improved connectivity
throughout Asia and the Pacific.

 

Also in July, ADB cosponsored the 2015 Pacific Update

policy issues in the Pacific. The 2015

event attracted about 200 policy makers,
academics, and development specialists.

Twice a year, ADB also publishes the
Pacific Economic Monitor. The publication
provides updates on the economic
performance of Pacific island countries,
complemented by policy briefs relevant to
the region’s decision makers.

TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES
INTEGRATION

Following the establishment of a highspeed broadband cable in Tonga, ADB
worked closely with development partners
to replicate this in Samoa and Palau.

As greater financial resources become
available, ADB will explore opportunities
to connect smaller and more remote
countries, such as the Cook Islands, to this
broadband network. Increased funding,
through the merging of the lending
operations of the Asian Development
Fund with the institution’s ordinary capital
resources, will provide scope for new
investments in wharves and jetties to
improve maritime links across the Pacific,
particularly for Nauru and Tuvalu.

 

ADB supported cooperation and integration
initiatives in the Pacific through seven
regional technical assistance programs
amounting to $12.72 million, inclusive of
cofinancing from Australia. Among these
are additional financing for the Pacific
Private Sector Development Initiative,
Pacific Economic Management, and the
PRIF. Regional assistance administered

by ADB covers climate change, education,
energy, gender equity, and core government
services.

INCLUSIVE GROWTH THROUGH

With a growing population and labor
force in the Pacific, expanding access

: to education and improving the skills of
: workers continue to be priorities. Furtherto the $19 million in assistance ADB has provided since
2012 to expand the University of the South Pacific,
construction of the new campus building in Tarawa, Kiribati,
was completed, with the official opening in November
2015. ADB will support the expansion of the campuses in
Solomon Islands and Fiji.

ADB is working to ensure gender balance in key
infrastructure projects, especially in urban water activities
and in policy-based operations, and looks to give

women more opportunities to build careers. Financial
inclusion reforms, supported by the Pacific Private Sector
Development Initiative, have encouraged the use of mobile
technology and targeted women-led businesses to promote
the economic empowerment of women.

BALANCED GROWTH THE KEY

ADB continues to support sustainable urban development
projects in Fiji, the Marshall Islands, Timor-Leste, and
Vanuatu. These projects focus on improving the water
supply and protecting the environment through the
proper disposal and treatment of wastewater. During the
fourth quarter, ADB approved additional financing of
$18.08 million, including cofinancing from Australia,

New Zealand, Denmark, and the European Union, to
support the expansion of sustainable, reliable, and
affordable energy across the region, with additional
financing to ongoing projects in PNG, Tonga, and Samoa.
ADB is also backing new renewable energy projects that are
being developed in Vanuatu and Solomon Islands.

ADB actively encourages the use of country safeguard
systems in the Pacific. Country safeguard systems
include both the legal frameworks and the institutional

Banking Gets Moving
in Papua New Guinea

As little as 15 years ago, more than 90% of the 5 million
people in Papua New Guinea (PNG) had no access to
financial services of any kind.

Since 2010, ADB, with cofinancing by Australia, has
supported a microfinance project that is expanding access
to financial services for rural communities and the poor of
PNG. The country’s first licensed microbank, Nationwide
Microbank, or MiBank, grew from a small ADB pilot program
to become the biggest microfinance bank in the South Pacific.

MiBank’s chief executive officer, Tony Westaway, says
microfinance is not just about access to credit, but also
about people having somewhere safe to put their money.
“Unbanked people in PNG bury their money in bamboo tubes
in the garden and hide their money under fireplaces. Some
people won't leave their homes, too scared to go to town in
case their life savings are found,” he says.

MiBank launched MiCash in 2011, the first bank-led
deployment of mobile money in the Pacific. It is a bank
account accessed via a mobile phone. People can use MiCash
to save money and pay bills. It has become popular with
women in particular.

Kobo Davana, a 42-year-old mother of five, finds MiCash
easy to use. Through it, she has learned to manage better the
money she earns from her vegetable garden. Kobo feels she
now has greater control of her finances.

The ADB microfinance project also supports the financial
and social empowerment of women, through the Women’s
Micro Bank, which has around 10,000 women customers.

arrangements to implement a country’s safeguards in

the areas of environment, involuntary resettlement,

and indigenous peoples. ADB has provided technical
assistance on country safeguard systems to Solomon
Islands and Vanuatu, and a regional program supporting
land acquisition and resettlement training in 10 developing
member countries in the Pacific was completed in 2015.
Through the PRIF, ADB—along with the World Bank, the
European Investment Bank, European Union, Australia,
New Zealand, and Japan—is part of a working group to
develop and adopt a common set of procedures to address
the management of environmental impacts and social
risks in infrastructure development. These procedures
must meet the safeguard requirements of development
partners and be easily implemented by developing
member countries.

Investment Momentum Set to Continue

The portfolio of active ADB projects in South Asia expanded from $15.3 billion in
2008 to $23.7 billion at the end of 2015. Further strong expansion in investment is
anticipated over the next 5 years. ADB has committed nearly $15 billion to the region
for 2017-2018.

¢ Infrastructure Development. Infrastructure lending will account for more than
two-thirds of total lending for 2017-2018. ADB will continue to invest in roads
and railways, renewable energy, energy efficiency, water supply and irrigation, food
security, and natural resource management. ADB anticipates approval in 2016 of
assistance for economic corridors in India. ADB intends to expand the corridor
strategy to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and other countries. ADB will contribute to
: regional connectivity of transport, energy, and information technology.

¢ Poverty Reduction and Inclusive Growth. ADB will focus on infrastructure
in education and health, while strengthening social assistance and labor market
programs. It foresees broader and more intensive investments in institutional
capacity for India. In Sri Lanka, ADB will focus on agriculture, natural resources,
and rural development as drivers of inclusive growth. It has also programmed
$1 billion for education in Sri Lanka over the next 5 years. In Nepal, the 2015
earthquake presented the need to scale up assistance. ADB will support
retrofitting, rebuilding, and capacity building on a much wider scale in the
affected areas.

¢ Environment and Climate Change. To address the surging demand for energy
in South Asia, ADB will help countries in the region develop renewable energy
sources. As a model of successful bilateral cooperation in green energy trade,
ADB supports Bhutan’s hydropower exports to India. It is also backing the power
interconnection between Bangladesh and India. To mitigate climate risk, ADB will
support a river training and flood control project in the Amochu river in Bhutan.

In Bangladesh, ADB approved a $200 million rail project
that will provide new carriages, locomotives, and equipment,
which will benefit 10 million passengers per year, and
increase Bangladesh Railway’s carrying capacity by 15%.
In India, ADB backed a $273 million rural connectivity
program that supports the government’s plan to link rural
communities to markets and other centers of economic
activity in the states of Assam, Chhattisgarh, Madhya
Pradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal. ADB also provided
$200 million to the third phase of Sri Lanka’s roads
integration program, which will improve roads in several
southern, central, and western provinces and thereby

increase the involvement of the rural population in
nationwide economic and social development.

In the energy sector, ADB is supporting the Government of
India’s initiative for green energy corridors. In December,

it approved $500 million for a power transmission system
that will share renewable energy across states.

 

In June, ADB approved a multitranche financing facility
of $453 million, with $114 million from cofinanciers
($60 million confirmed from the European Investment
Bank), to support a water security program in Mahaweli,
Sri Lanka. The project will help the government underpin
climate resilience, delivering water for agricultural and
municipal use on a sustainable basis.

In June, ADB extended $200 million in earthquake
emergency assistance to Nepal. This funding will help

an income to support his family of 11 and to rebuild his
home in the village of Changunarayan in Bhaktapur, about
20 kilometers northeast of Kathmandu. Today, Datheputhe
remains in Changunarayan, learning new masonry skills to
reconstruct his own home and find work rebuilding others.
“| will be applying these skills while constructing buildings
and houses in the future,” said the 37-year-old. The
earthquake and aftershocks destroyed nearly 500,000
houses across Nepal, and partially damaged another
250,000.

Datheputhe, along with 19 other people from his village,
is participating in 390 hours of training in earthquakeresilient building methods. Financed and conducted by
ADB, the masonry course is based in Kathmandu and
attracted 280 participants in 2015. It is projected to train
a further 1,280 people across the country in 2016.

While masonry in Nepal has traditionally been carried
out by men, 72 women have already completed the
course. “I will be able to find a new job after acquiring
these skills,” said Sapana Karki, a 19-year-old woman from
Changunarayan.

Under an ongoing skills development project, ADB has
provided training to 45,000 young Nepalis in the services,
manufacturing, and construction sectors, with 30% of
trainees from marginalized groups and 40% women.

to future disasters, and focus on reconstructing water
infrastructure and other urban utilities.

DIVERSE KNOWLEDGE SHARING

ADB project support for South Asia is enhanced by a
vibrant knowledge-sharing program.

In March, ADB conducted a high-level workshop in Bhutan
to discuss business climate, national competitiveness,
foreign investment, and global value chains. In May, it
supported the International Conference on Urban Health,
held for the first time in Asia and hosted by Bangladesh.

In August, ADB released An Enduring Partnership, a book on
development achievements in the Maldives describing how
ADB has contributed to these since 1978. In September,

30 ANNUAL REPORT 2015

  
 

ADB contributed to a 10-day pilot executive training
program for Nepal’s mid-level officials, based on the
government’s initiative to improve the capacity of its civil
service. In October, ADB held a workshop in Sri Lanka
on involuntary resettlement caused by the construction
of an expressway, demonstrating the good resettlement
practices that emerged from it.

In November, ADB was the knowledge partner for the
Resurgent Rajasthan Partnership Summit, 2015, in Jaipur,
India, and cosponsored the Third South Asia Regional
Public Procurement Conference held in Bangladesh.

DRIVING TIGHTER INTEGRATION

ADB continued to support the South Asia Subregional
Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Program as its lead
vehicle to strengthen cooperation and connectivity in the
region.

In June, SASEC coordinated the historic signing of

the Bangladesh—Bhutan-India-Nepal Motor Vehicle
Agreement and the finalization of the India- Myanmar-—
Thailand Motor Vehicle Agreement. The agreements
will make it quicker, easier, and cheaper for passenger
and freight vehicles to cross borders and travel along
designated trade routes in participating countries.

In September, ADB provided $120 million to upgrade the

power grid connecting Bangladesh and India. This will
double electricity imports from India—from the current
500 megawatts to 1,000 megawatts—to help Bangladesh
meet the rising demand for power from a rapidly growing
economy without further increasing dependence on costly
oil- and diesel-based power generation.ADB also approved $30 million funding for Bangladesh
to prepare high-priority transport projects that will open
the way for cross-border traffic and improve subregional
trade along the Trans-Asian Railway and Asian Highway
networks,

In 2015, ADB prepared analytical studies for the East
Coast Economic Corridor, India’s first coastal economic
corridor linking Kolkata in the east, through Chennai, to
Tuticorin in the south. With development based around
ports, the East Coast Economic Corridor will provide
India with access to global production networks and forge
deeper trading links with Southeast Asia and East Asia.

HEALTH LEADS TO INCLUSIVE GROWTH

In 2015, ADB continued its work to expand access

to opportunities for marginalized groups in South Asia,
particularly poor communities and disadvantaged
women.

In May, ADB committed $300 million of support to an

urban health initiative of the Government of India, which
has a core strategy of strengthening the primary health
infrastructure and services across all cities and towns with
a population above 50,000. This is ADB’s first investment
in the country’s health sector, aiming to reinforce
government efforts to develop urban health systems

that can deliver quality services and reach the poor and
vulnerable.

In Bangladesh, ADB is supporting an ongoing rural
infrastructure project that has already benefited

half a million people in 12 districts in the southwest
coastal region, including the poor, with more than

21 kilometers (km) of roads constructed and 23 markets
erected in 2015. Another urban infrastructure project in
31 municipalities throughout the country will benefit more
than 200,000 people, with 136 km of roads and 45 km
of drains expected to be completed by mid-2016. ADB
assistance helped deliver a skills program that trained
more than 20,000 people (including 4,700 women)
and led to 2,350 of them receiving job offers in 2015.
ADB provided additional financing of $120 million to an
education program, leading to more than 2,000 schools
being built and more than 3.3 million preschoolers and
21.7 million primary students receiving free textbooks.

ADB is promoting inclusive growth in the Maldives

by supporting access to credit for micro, small, and
medium-sized enterprises. The funding is helping to
generate income for sole traders and create jobs in
small businesses. In October, ADB approved a grant

of $600,000 to help improve access to jobs, markets,
schools, health, and basic services in Laamu, the largest
atoll in the Maldives.

CLEAN, GREEN ENERGY
SPURS GROWTH

Throughout 2015, promoting
environmentally sustainable growth
remained a pillar of ADB support for
South Asia.

With a rising demand for energy to
propel the region’s economic growth,
the challenge of climate change is
especially acute in South Asia. ADB
is helping countries explore and
utilize local green energy sources,
and is working to enhance regional
cooperation in trading energy.

More than 40% of projects approved by
ADB for India during 2015 will provide
tangible benefits to the environment.
These include energy sector projects
that support the reliable supply of
clean energy and promote the use of
least-cost and low-carbon options.
The Orissa irrigated agriculture
program also supports environmental
sustainability through better disaster
risk management and improved food
security.

In Nepal, ADB has made improving
the environment a key strategic
priority. It is financing an ongoing
project in Kathmandu Valley to
provide clean water and sanitation to
more than 1.3 million people. In April,
ADB provided additional funding

of $90 million for this project, to
rehabilitate and expand the valley’s
sewerage network, modernize
wastewater treatment plants, and
improve wastewater management—
all working to reduce pollution of the
valley’s Bagmati River.

In Sri Lanka, ADB made an investment
to improve the country’s resilience

to climate change. About 6.2 million

Sri Lankans, or 30% of the population,
live in the country’s northern dry zone,
which often experiences low rainfall and
drought. The ADB investment will help
transfer excess water from the Mahaweli
River Basin to the northern dry zone

for irrigation, drinking, and commercial
purposes.

OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

ADB supported its members across Southeast Asia

in 2015 with $3.47 billion in loans and grants and

$53.38 million in technical assistance (including technical
assistance official cofinancing). ADB directed the bulk of its
assistance to the sectors of energy (37%), finance (23%),
and water and other urban infrastructure and services
(20%). ADB liaised closely with development partners and
mobilized $2.16 billion in official cofinancing for loans and
grants in 2015. Contracts awarded totaled $1.60 billion,Lo7-N iB] Tene)

 

Wide-Scale Funding Boosts for Key Sectors

ADB operations in Southeast Asia have expanded significantly in recent years. Its portfolio
of active projects in the region has risen in value from $11.3 billion in 2011 to $17.8 billion
in 2015.

 

¢ Infrastructure Development. ADB will adopt a more holistic approach, using sectorwide programs, to scale up and sustain its investment in developing key infrastructure
across the region. During 2016-2018, ADB expects to commit 44% of its total
investment in the region to infrastructure development, with a focus on large projects
and programs in the transport, energy, and urban sectors.

¢ Inclusive Growth. ADB is expanding its education program in Cambodia, the Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. It is also
identifying opportunities for lending in Myanmar and Thailand. ADB will focus on
maintaining support for social protection, health operations, and regional public goods,
including effective regional responses to communicable diseases. For 2016-2018, ADB
proposes over $2 billion for education and health sector programs.

 

 

Financial inclusion will be at the heart of ADB operations in Cambodia, Indonesia, the
Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. Prior to
designing its programs, ADB is partnering with other donors to determine precisely the
financial supply and demand situation on the ground in each country.

¢ Environment and Climate Change. ADB will expand its support for climate change
adaptation at both policy and operational levels in Southeast Asia. ADB will continue
to ensure that critical infrastructure investments are climate-proofed as much as
possible. ADB will also support climate change mitigation through projects promoting
clean energy, sustainable transport, and improved urban development. During 20162018, about $1.8 billion is slated for investment into clean energy for the region. These
investments will be particularly significant in Indonesia, Myanmar, and Viet Nam. ADB
will also aim to implement the first carbon capture and storage plant in Indonesia, and
also the region, and promote off-grid renewable energy in the region.

 

while disbursements reached $1.42 billion for investment
projects and $1.96 billion for policy-based loans.

In September, ADB approved a policy-based loan of
$500 million, including $100 million from the ADBadministered ASEAN Infrastructure Fund, to strengthen
the governance of the energy sector in Indonesia,
including lowering subsidies and improving the
performance of state-owned enterprises. The program
will bolster the government's efforts to scale up renewable
energy to 23% of the energy mix and provide nearuniversal access to electricity by 2020. The loan was
cofinanced with the Agence Francaise de Développement,
KfW, and the World Bank. In November, ADB approved a
power supply project for the Yangon region in Myanmar,
which will improve electricity reliability and reduce
transmission loss by 18% by 2020. In December, ADB
approved a $575 million project to strengthen Sumatra’s
power grid and provide reliable, uninterrupted electricity

to the island. ADB approved a third phase of financing of
a power transmission program in Viet Nam in December
2015. The program aims to expand the capacity of the
country’s power network to satisfy the growing demand
for electricity from industrial, commercial, and residential
consumers by 2025.

ADB approved a $400 million program in September
2015 to increase the development and inclusiveness of
the finance sector in Indonesia. In the Philippines, ADB

is backing capital market reforms with a $300 million
support program in November. This is complemented by
a $300 million public sector management package, which
will expand private sector participation in infrastructure
development, and encourage public-private partnerships
in the country. ADB is seeking to deepen the finance
sector in Viet Nam and improve investor confidence

and, in November, approved a second subprogram of
$100 million for these measures.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK = 33ADB is one of the backers of a large project to improve
water and other urban infrastructure and services in
Southeast Asia. The funding is helping to develop seven
cities along economic corridors in Cambodia, the Lao PDR,
and Viet Nam. Under the project, about 7,700 households
will benefit from improved wastewater services, 12,300
households will be serviced by improved solid waste
collection, and 25,500 households will be better protected
from flooding. In November, ADB approved a project to
improve sanitation coverage in Tonle Sap in Cambodia, from
50% in 2013 to at least 90% by 2022. In Viet Nam, a third
phase of financing will deliver a sustainable supply of clean
water in five provinces by 2020, giving 1.2 million people
access to clean water for the first time.

SHARING KNOWLEDGE TO AVERT DISASTERS

ADB organized the Regional Knowledge Forum on PostDisaster Recovery in October 2015 to share experiences
and lessons from Typhoon Yolanda (internationally called
Haiyan), Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Sandy, floods in
Thailand, the tsunami in Aceh, and the earthquake in
Yogyakarta. The forum was attended by over 80 delegates
from Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand.

The GrEEEn Solutions for Livable Cities follow the 3E
philosophy of economy, environment, and equity.
The solutions are the result of a 2-year initiative and

Thailand, and Viet Nam. In 2015, ADB helped develop
action plans and investment strategies to make cities in
Southeast Asia more livable.

ADB initiated a major technical assistance project focusing
on the health implications of climate change in Cambodia,
the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. The project will help improve
the ability of government agencies to monitor and evaluate
climate change adaptation in projects for agriculture,
transport, and urban water supply and sanitation. ADB also
produced publications to promote low-carbon growth in
Indonesia. These included a report on unlocking geothermal
energy and a feasibility study on what could become the first
carbon capture and storage project in Southeast Asia.

COOPERATION ON TRAVEL AND TRADE

During 2015, ADB maintained its strong support of regional
integration in Southeast Asia.

In September, the GMS Urban Development Strategic
Framework 2015-2022, the GMS Tourism Marketing

Strategy and Action Plan 2015-2020, and the new GMS
projects database were presented at the 20th Greater
Mekong Subregion (GMS) Ministerial Conference. GMS
ministers also reviewed progress made in implementing the

for connecting subregional railways.

The GMS also made notable progress
on strengthening transport and trade
facilitation. GMS countries ratified

the GMS Cross-Border Transport
Facilitation Agreement. Single-stop
customs inspections were implemented
between the Lao PDR and Viet Nam at
the Lao Bao-Dansavanh border crossing,
and additional single-stop customs
inspections are planned for other border
points in the subregion. The GMS

also finalized its Transport and Trade

and is also supporting the upgrade of
roads in Kalimantan in Indonesia and
Mindanao in the Philippines. In April, the
Indonesia—Malaysia-Thailand Growth
Triangle Summit endorsed a new green
city action plan, prepared with the
support of ADB, for Songkhla in Thailand.

PATHS TO INCLUSIVE GROWTH

Efficient public transport is central to
inclusive growth in Southeast Asia. In
March, ADB approved an urban transport
project in Vientiane in the Lao PDR,
which aims to increase use of public bus
services from 4,000 passengers per day
in 2013 to 48,000 passengers per day

by 2020. A $100 million road project in
Myanmar will rehabilitate 66.4 kilometers
of road in the mountainous Kayin State,
improving access to services and job
opportunities. The road project will also
attract tourists and enable farmers to
transport their produce to market.

In August, ADB approved a grant for
Myanmar under the Asia Pacific Disaster
Response Fund. The grant will finance
relief efforts for communities affected by
floods and landslides in July and August
of 2015.In the Lao PDR, a health sector program supported

by ADB will contribute to the government’s goal of
achieving universal health coverage by 2025 and
improving the delivery of health services, particularly for
the poor, women, and children.

In September 2015, to address rising income inequality
in Indonesia, ADB approved a $400 million program that
helps the government promote financial stability, deepen
the financial market, and promote access to financial
services by poor households.

In the Philippines, ADB support aims to help 15,000
out-of-school youths find decent jobs. In October,
ADB approved a technical assistance project for these
measures, as part of the nationwide rollout of JobStart
Philippines. The technical assistance will also help
development institutions in one of the poorest regions
in the Philippines to agree on and prioritize initiatives to
increase jobs and economic activity.

INCREASING ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS

In 2015, ADB ramped up environmental considerations
in Southeast Asia.

In November, ADB approved a $60 million project

aimed at improving the urban environment and public
health in Mandalay in Myanmar, as well as a $100 million
project that aims to enhance climate resilience of urban
infrastructure in Viet Nam.

 

In December, ADB approved additional cofinancing
of $67.85 million (including $16 million from the
Pilot Program for Climate Resilience) for a rural roads

From Poverty to Prosperity

Yun Kea, 40, used to spend her days trying to grow enough
vegetables to support her family in Tbong Khmum province,
on the central lowlands of the Mekong River. The mother of
two was earning only $300 from the vegetables and, for half
the year, had to borrow money to feed her family and pay
for her children’s education.

Things have changed for Yun Kea over the past year. Her
annual income has risen by 70% since she began training in
small business management, agricultural techniques, and
livestock production.

“Now | can grow more vegetables and raise more
chickens, so | have enough money to spend on my
children’s education and do not need to take on new debt,”
Yun Kea said.

Yun Kea’s livelihood has improved, thanks to $51 million
invested by ADB, the International Fund for Agricultural
Development, and the Government of Finland, to reduce
poverty and develop smallholder farming around Tonle Sap.

The project will teach about 300,000 poor farmers
improved agricultural techniques, and give them access to

In 2015, ADB also approved a $60 million project to
create sustainable irrigation in Cambodia’s upland
areas. In the Philippines, ADB support helped develop
and pilot priority climate actions, based on the climate
change vulnerability assessments and greenhouse gas
inventories of 14 local government units. Through ADB

SUPPORTING ASIA AND THE PACIFIC

ADB has a long-term strategy to scale up private

sector development and operations to half of its annual
operations by 2020. In 2015, the ADB portfolio of private
sector projects continued to expand, with a strong focus on
infrastructure (particularly renewable and clean energy),
financial institutions engaged in microfinance, and the
financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

ADB also intensified its support for public sector agencies,
deploying technical assistance to help governments

build capacity in preparing bankable projects for private
investment. The Office of Public-Private Partnership
enjoyed its first calendar year of full-scale operations and
achieved significant results in helping governments prepare
and deliver public-private partnerships (PPPs) and large
infrastructure projects.

PROJECTS FOR PRIVATE PARTICIPATION

In the Philippines, ADB provided a $300 million policybased loan in October to help develop capital markets

and enhance the availability of long-term capital for PPP
projects from banks and nonbank financial institutions.
ADB also approved a policy-based loan of $300 million

in November to strengthen the government’s capacity to
manage the fiscal costs arising from PPPs, expand and
improve PPP project implementation, and strengthen legal
and regulatory frameworks.

ADB approved two regional technical assistance projects
to promote PPPs in 2015. The first is based around
capacity development and will help developing member
countries (DMCs) better prepare infrastructure projects to
secure private sector financing, particularly projects that
promote regional or subregional connectivity. The second,
transaction advisory technical assistance, will develop
capacity in preparing and implementing PPP projects.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 37SCALING UP

 

ADB Gears Up for Private Investment

The strong growth in ADB’s private sector approvals in 2015
(up 62% since 2013) is proof of ADB’s success in scaling up
its private sector operations.

ADB believes that the private sector is a key engine of growth
and a critical partner in alleviating poverty. By promoting an
improved business climate, with enhanced access to more
flexible financing solutions and trade facilitation tools, ADB
is helping the private sector create high-quality jobs and
increase living standards across Asia and the Pacific.

ADB will continue to help strengthen the business
environment in developing member countries to promote
private investment. ADB will pursue the target of approving
at least 40% of its private sector transactions for low-income
countries. ADB’s private sector operations will focus on
renewable energy as a means of achieving inclusive green
growth, maintaining the annual target for 25% of approved
transactions to be directed to clean and renewable energy,
and energy efficiency. ADB will double its financing for
climate change adaptation and mitigation by 2020, including
playing a major role to attract private sector climate finance.
ADB’s private sector operations will continue promoting
“inclusive business” transactions targeting the economically
disadvantaged. It will also increase focus on transactions
with specific gender elements, including those that directly
benefit women and those that connect households to
services such as access to health, finance, energy, and water.

ADB provided technical assistance to support further
development of the PPP regime in the People’s Republic
of China (PRC). In April, the State Council approved
comprehensive regulations on concessions for PPPs as a
precursor to developing a national concession law. The
technical assistance supported the PRC in analyzing various
recent and successful PPP modalities and agreements.
ADB continued to provide advisory support on reforms

to open the elderly care sector to more extensive private
participation, and provided technical assistance to better
define the role of the state in the economy, creating a level
playing field for the public and private sectors.

ADVISING AND COORDINATING
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS
In 2015, ADB continued its transaction advisory mandate

for the planned 1,600-kilometer TurkmenistanAfghanistan-Pakistan—India (TAPI) natural gas pipeline

38 ANNUAL REPORT 2015

project. The TAPI pipeline will export up to 33 billion cubic
meters of natural gas a year from Turkmenistan to Afghanistan,
Pakistan, and India over 30 years. During 2015, ADB facilitated
the endorsement of Turkmengaz as the project’s consortium
leader, and the execution of the Shareholders Agreement.
Construction of the TAPI Turkmen stretch commenced in
December. ADB acts both as secretariat and transaction
advisor for the project, and throughout 2015 was instrumental
in facilitating collaboration among the four participating
governments.

In July, a combined heat and power project in Ulaanbaatar,
Mongolia—with a capacity to produce the equivalent of

587 megawatts (MW) of heat and 450 MW of power each
year—reached an important milestone. Aided by ADB’s
active advisory involvement, the project successfully
executed the power purchase agreement governing its offtake
arrangements.

Mongolia signed the documentation for its first PPP in the
education sector in February, drawing on advisory support from
ADB. Involving about $140 million in investment, this PPP

will develop 72 kindergarten and primary school complexes,
predominantly in low-income areas of Ulaanbaatar.

CREATING A POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR
BUSINESSES AND SHARING KNOWLEDGE

In May, ADB approved technical assistance amounting to
$8.08 million (in addition to the original $30 million), for the
third phase of the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative
(PSDI), which is cofinanced by Australia and New Zealand and
operates in the 14 ADB DMCs in the Pacific. This will allow
the PSDI to further drive competition policy and the economic
empowerment of women. The additional financing will help to
remove constraints to doing business, foster entrepreneurship,
streamline regulations, and raise productivity in the Pacific.
This will enable the private sector to grow, create jobs,
generate tax revenue, and lift people out of poverty.

 

During 2015, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) approached ADB for technical assistance through
the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum to enhance the capacity
of capital market regulators. ASEAN requested the assistance
to also continue implementing initiatives under the ASEAN
Implementation Plan 2015 for regional capital market
integration. In June, ADB approved a technical assistance
project, financed by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund
under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing.
Partnership Facility, to provide capacity building for members
of the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum as well as the ASEAN
stock exchanges.

 

In Bhutan, ADB helped create a new Better Business Council,
which will act as a conduit between the government, foreign
investors, and local businesses. In the Kyrgyz Republic,

ADB approved the Second Investment Climate Improvement
Program in June. The program aims to increase and diversify
financial products and services to better mobilize domesticsavings and to reduce the cost of doing business in the
Kyrgyz Republic. ADB approved a similar program in
Tajikistan in December.

EXPANDING INVESTMENTS IN TARGET
SECTORS

In 2015, ADB backed infrastructure projects that
explored innovative ways of advancing sustainable
development, and supported agribusiness projects that
focused on small-scale farming. It fostered partnerships
with commercial banks and financial institutions to
promote inclusiveness, and approved a wide range of
energy and water projects to drive sustainable growth.
ADB’s flagship Trade Finance Program (TFP) expanded
its reach to Myanmar and laid the foundations for a
2016 expansion into the Pacific.

During the year, ADB approved projects for gas, hydro,
wind, and solar power generation, as well as power
transmission. With a direct loan of $250 million and

a B loan of $225 million, ADB helped finance the
second stage of the expansion of the Shah Deniz

Gas Field in Azerbaijan. The project—expected to
employ over 16,000 people during 2014-2022—will
result in environmentally safe and technically sound
development of the largest proven gas reserve in
Azerbaijan, the bulk of which will be sold to southern
Europe. In Pakistan, a loan of $30 million to Engro
Elengy Terminal will support the country’s first liquefied
natural gas regasification facility, helping diversify the
country’s energy base. ADB also approved a loan of
$65 million for a 102 MW hydropower project in Gulpur,
Pakistan. The cost of electricity from this project is
expected to be significantly lower than that for plants
using imported fuel. In Myanmar, ADB supported the
Myingyan natural gas power plant, the country’s first
competitively tendered power plant. The project will
provide a balanced source of electricity to the country,
avoiding greenhouse gas emissions.

To promote renewable energy, ADB provided a direct
loan of $157.5 million and $19 million from the Clean
Technology Fund for a 260 MW wind power project
in northeastern Thailand. In the Philippines, ADB
committed a loan of $20 million for a 150 MW wind
farm project in the Burgos municipality. This is the
largest private wind farm in Southeast Asia to date. The
project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of largescale, privately owned wind farms. It will significantly
contribute to the government’s target of 200 MW of
wind power capacity by 2023.

ADB approved a nonsovereign loan of $500 million

to Power Grid Corporation of India to help improve
electricity transmission infrastructure. Improvements to
the transmission of power from the country’s northern
region, which is rich in green energy, will help increase
the availability of renewable energy to other parts

of the country. ADB also approved a concurrent loan of
$500 million, with a sovereign guarantee, for this project.

ADB helped Simpa Energy build on the success of its
innovative off-grid, rural rooftop solar power project

in India, which ADB had first funded in 2013. In October,
ADB tapped the Clean Technology Fund to provide

the company with additional support of $6 million in
concessional funding. This investment will help install solar
systems in microenterprises.

ADB also moved to strengthen support for private sector
involvement in agribusiness in 2015. With a rapidly
increasing focus on food security, ADB created an
Agribusiness Investment Team, which became operational
within the Private Sector Operations Department in January.

In June, ADB approved a direct equity investment of

$3 million in Mountain Hazelnuts Group in Bhutan, to help
increase exports of hazelnuts sourced from small-scale
farmers. The increase in exports is expected to double the
annual incomes of these farmers. This project also includes
technical assistance—financed by the Canadian Climate

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 39Fund for the Private Sector in Asia, under the Clean Energy
Financing Partnership Facility—that will provide training in
personal finance to farming households, particularly those
headed by women.

GOING BEYOND BANKING

To support inclusive and environmentally sustainable
growth, ADB channels funding to key sectors through banks
and financial institutions. In 2015, ADB approved a loan

of $10 million to Bai Tushum Bank (BTB) in the Kyrgyz
Republic to expand lending to micro, small, and mediumsized enterprises (MSMEs). The ADB commitment includes
technical assistance to support financial literacy programs

and to develop mobile banking services. BTB will ensure that :

women-owned MSMEs benefit from at least 20% of

the ADB loan and account for at least 39% of BTB’s total
accounts. In India, ADB also approved a $100 million loan
and $51 million equity investment in RBL Bank to help grow
its portfolio of MSME and agricultural enterprises to 10% of
total lending.

In Sri Lanka, ADB committed loans totaling $100 million—

a direct loan of $55 million and a B loan of $45 million—for
onlending to MSMEs through LOLC Finance and LOLC
Micro Credit. ADB is also providing technical assistance to

institutions to reach underserved markets.

In the PRC, ADB approved a loan of $75 million to Yingda
International Leasing to finance the lease or purchase of
modern medical equipment for public hospitals. The project
will help improve the diagnostic and treatment capacity of
hospitals in less-developed regions.

Three financial institutions in Georgia (Credo Microfinance
Organization, FINCA Bank Georgia, and TBC Bank) will
receive a combined total of $130 million to expand their
MSME lending operations. Accompanying technical
assistance will help provide business advice to MSMEs and
promote financial literacy to households. Separate loans to
two financial institutions in Azerbaijan will provide income
opportunities to the country’s farmers. ADB approved a
direct loan of $75 million to Accessbank Azerbaijan, and

a direct loan of $20 million with a B loan of $5 million to
FINCA Azerbaijan, to provide sustainable financial services

financial products to farmers, and expand into remote areas.

In October, ADB approved an equity investment of

$45 million in the Creador III L.P. Fund. Creador invests

critical growth capital in middle-market companies in South

in financial services, consumer goods and services, and
business services.

ADB is also supporting innovation in development finance.
In many markets in developing Asia, commercial banks’
ability to provide long-tenor lending is constrained by

report proposes an

regulatory requirements on capital

and exposure limits on borrowers and
sectors. Sponsors of infrastructure
projects are beginning to explore
capital markets as an alternative source
of project financing. In 2015, ADB
successfully supported this fledgling
bond market.

Following recommendations from
ADB, Aboitiz Power Renewables
undertook a capital restructuring

of its Tiwi and Makiling-Banahaw
(Tiwi-MakBan) geothermal power
plants in the Philippines by tapping
the bond market. The transaction
was aimed at allowing Aboitiz Power
to redeploy capital toward its large
pipeline of new power investments
that include renewable energy. ADB
approved a partial credit guarantee of
up to $181.2 million of principal and
interest to the new bondholders, and
a loan to Aboitiz Power Renewables of
up to $40.6 million for the project. The
successful use of credit enhancement
for Tiwi-MakBan reflects ADB’s
evolving strategy to make creative
use of its expanding balance sheet to
support infrastructure investment.
Credit-enhanced project bonds offer
an attractive alternative to bank
financing, and by mobilizing costeffective, long-term capital, can

help close the region’s infrastructure
gap. The Climate Bond, which has
been certified by the Climate Bonds
Initiative, is the first in Asia and the
Pacific and the first-ever Climate Bond
for a single project in an emerging
market.

In another landmark achievement,
ADB and the India Infrastructure
Finance Company jointly guaranteed a
Rs4.51 billion project bond, issued by
ReNew Power Ventures, to refinance
an existing wind power plant in India.
ADB’s credit enhancement improved
the credit rating of the bonds, opening
them up to institutional investors in
India. ReNew will use the proceeds

of this green bond issuance to prepay
bank loans that were used to finance
their 85 MW wind project in the

state of Maharashtra, thus allowing
commercial banks to recycle capital
into new infrastructure developments.FINANCING GLOBAL AND REGIONAL TRADE

Through its TFP, ADB helps close market gaps for trade

by providing banks with guarantees and loans in support

of cross-border trade finance. In 2015, the TFP facilitated
about 1,900 transactions valued at over $2.5 billion, with
over $1.4 billion cofinanced by banks, private insurers, an
export credit agency, and International Enterprise Singapore.
Over 90% of these transactions were carried out in lowerincome countries. The TFP provided support to about 1,450
SMEs, with about 280 trade transactions between DMCs.

In 2015, the TFP laid the foundations for its expansion

into the Pacific. It identified candidate banks that could
participate in the TFP and provided training to bankers
from 12 Pacific DMCs. In November, the TFP added its first
participating bank in Myanmar and, in December, it added
more participating banks in Bangladesh and Viet Nam.

PROVIDING FINANCE FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH

Rapid urbanization places increased pressure on water
resources. In the PRC, ADB supported two projects to
improve water quality and availability, and avoid water
pollution. In September, ADB approved a direct loan of

$150 million and a B loan of $150 million to increase water
supply and wastewater treatment capacity for the lessdeveloped western areas— Chongqing, Gansu, Guizhou,
Hubei, Hunan, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and
Yunnan. In November, ADB provided a direct loan of

$100 million and a B loan of $150 million to help SMEs in the

PRC build wastewater and sludge treatment plants.

ADB approved two projects for affordable housing in
India. The first is an investment of $35 million in Drashti
Developers for the Shapoorji Affordable Housing Project.

  
 

OPPP Makes Great Strides
in First Full Year

With the Office of Public-Private Partnership (OPPP)
becoming fully operational at the start of 2015, ADB
continued to embrace the private sector to finance
infrastructure projects.

In January, to attract greater private sector investment
and participation in developing Asia’s infrastructure, OPPP
began managing the Asia Pacific Project Preparation Facility,
with more than $73 million funded by the governments of
Japan, Canada, and Australia.

At the ADB Annual Meeting in May, OPPP signed a
groundbreaking co-advisory agreement to provide more
public-private partnership (PPP) opportunities for eight
private sector banks. The agreement aims to help public
sector clients structure successful and bankable PPPs,
without crowding out private sector advisors.

Also in May, OPPP teamed up with the Development
Bank of the Philippines to secure a mandate to co-advise
the government on the North-South Railway Project.

The $3.8 billion PPP is the largest in the Philippines’ national
program and is OPPP’s first mandate. It will build or upgrade
653 kilometers of rail lines, improve stations, repair bridges,
and modernize signaling and fare-collection systems.

The prequalification conference in August attracted

over 150 attendees from more than 40 companies.

In August, OPPP signed a memorandum of
understanding with Sarana Multi Infrastruktur to establish
co-advisory arrangements for PPPs in Indonesia.

ADB will finance the construction of about 20,000 affordable
residential units, which will be built in line with green building
principles. The project is expected to create about 9,000 jobs
during construction. ADB also approved a loan of $150 million
to PNB Housing Finance in support of its growing mortgage
finance operations, which target low-cost housing.

Supporting improved connectivity in Myanmar, ADB
financed a nationwide telecommunications project by
Ooredoo Myanmar, with a loan of $150 million and a B loan
of $300 million. The project will extend a third-generation
telecommunications network across Myanmar, while
developing mobile applications for health, banking, and
agriculture services. It will promote gender equality and lead
to improved employment prospects for women, by providing
training in information and communication technology.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 41These reforms responded to the changing dynamics of global

development, the expanding needs of Asia and the Pacific,
and the evolving expectations of ADB’s developing member
countries (DMCs). The changes made were also guided by
the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 Action Plan (MTR
Action Plan), which includes 192 reforms aimed at increasing
operational efficiency and effectiveness, while acknowledging
the changing development environment.

n 2015, ADB carried out far-reaching organizational reforms.

ADB continued to implement procurement reforms introduced
in August 2014. These measures have reduced procurement
time, increased administrative efficiency, and maintained
sound financial oversight. The time taken to process
transactions above $10 million was reduced from 58 days in
2014 to 44 days in the first half of 2015. In part, this resulted
from increasing delegation to field offices.

In 2015, ADB continued to build a strong mix of highperforming and high-potential staff with the right balance of
skills to carry the organization. These were complemented

by a comprehensive skills audit and workforce and workload
analyses. These initiatives are part of broader efforts to ensure
that ADB remains dynamic, agile, innovative, and strongly
focused on results.

ENSURING RESULTS

Managing for Development Results

ADB uses a framework for corporate results and a performance
scorecard to monitor and manage its performance. The
corporate results framework tracks the development progress
of the region, ADB’s contributions to country outcomes, and
its operational and institutional effectiveness. Every year,

ADB publishes the scorecard in its annual Development
Effectiveness Review (DEfR).

ADB made progress on the scorecard in several areas in 2015.
It achieved most of its targets in operations, which were tightly
aligned with its strategic agenda—and did so within budget.

It achieved record lending, disbursements, and cofinancing
results. However, the 2015 DEfR also identified issues

relating to delays in starting up and completing operations;
addressing country, sector, and project issues that impede

the sustainability of infrastructure operations; and increasing
representation of women in international staff positions at
ADB. ADB is addressing the issues under its MTR Action Plan.

Progress on Aid Effectiveness

ADB is committed to the globally accepted principles of
development cooperation. It tracks its progress by monitoring
the alignment of its operations with a country’s development
plans and poverty reduction goals. It also seeks to bolster the
use of country systems, including national public financial
management and procurement systems, to reduce transaction
costs and help support their development. All ADB operations

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 43ADB IS COMMITTED TO THE
GLOBALLY ACCEPTED PRINCIPLES
OF DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION

approved in 2015 were linked with, or contributed to, targets
within national development plans. ADB’s use of a country’s

systems in its sovereign operations improved to 60% in 2015, :

up from 55% in 2014.

Reaffirming its commitment to the effective development
cooperation principles, in 2015 ADB supported the

Lao People’s Democratic Republic and the Philippines

in preparing development finance and aid assessments.
This work was done in collaboration with the United
Nations Development Programme. These case studies
provided inputs to the ADB regional report on Financing
for Development as well as contributions to the sustainable
development growth agenda.

Safeguards

Country safeguard systems refer to the laws, regulations,
rules, and procedures in the policy areas of environment,
involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples, and
their implementing institutions. In 2015, ADB engaged

in policy dialogue and provided technical assistance to
strengthen DMC capacity to conduct due diligence, review,
and supervision. In cooperation with development partners,
ADB helped establish learning centers for safeguard
practitioners in Viet Nam and the Philippines. ADB also held
seven workshops on safeguards for implementing agencies,
government officers, private sector staff, and consultants.

impact on the environment and their social risks.

Accountability and Compliance

The ADB Accountability Mechanism (AM) exists to address
complaints from people affected by ADB projects, as a last
resort when all other means of redress have been tried. This
is done through the Office of the Special Project Facilitator
(OSPF) which handles problem solving and the Compliance
Review Panel (CRP) which handles policy issues. The AM

households. Using the experience gained
in processing the complaint, a 2-day
training session was held in November
to improve the complaint-handling skills
of government and project staff. In 2015,
the OSPF continued to mediate ona
complaint in Samoa, where stakeholders
recruited an expert to help design and
implement a consultation strategy. The
OSPF also conducted staff briefings on
communicating to avoid and resolve
conflicts, and developed a problemsolving guide to help ADB operations
staff and stakeholders deal with conflict
and problems.

In early 2015, the CRP visited the railway
rehabilitation project in Cambodia to
monitor remedial actions approved by
the Board in 2014. Lessons learned
from this complaint were shared in a
briefing attended by 120 ADB staff

in September. A second request for
compliance review on this project was
received and determined ineligible by
the CRP. In March, the CRP reported
on its compliance review of the Mundra
Ultra Mega Power Project in India.

The report detailed noncompliance
with ADB’s environmental policy.
Environmental and livelihood impact
studies are being prepared to specify
remedial actions. The CRP also released
a final monitoring report on Indonesia’s
major water resources management
program. The report highlighted the
contribution of compliance reviews in
enhancing national land acquisition laws.

In 2015, the CRP and OSPF held joint
outreach activities in the countries

of the Greater Mekong Subregion

and the People’s Republic of China.

It also met separately with the Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank and theRESEARCH

New Development Bank. The two institutions indicated
interest in collaborating with the AM in setting up their
accountability principles.

Disclosure and Transparency

In February, ADB made all of its economic and development
research on Asia and the Pacific available under open
access. The open access principle promotes unrestricted
online availability of scholarly research so that it can

be more widely distributed and used. Researchers and
academics can now easily download, disseminate, and

use ADB’s scholarly content and research publications,
with minimal restrictions. Along with project information,
documents, and business opportunities on the ADB
website, visitors can now also see project results on the site,
which was made “mobile friendly” in 2015.

DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE

Human Resources Management
In 2015, ADB posted 578 job vacancies, which generated
about 52,000 applications from nationals of 64 of ADB’s

67 member countries, highlighting the strong demand to
work at ADB.

During the year, ADB strengthened its talent management
practices, improved the recruitment and retention of staff,
and enhanced recruitment efficiencies (including skills
forecasting and succession planning). ADB introduced
renewable fixed-term contracts and 360-degree feedback
for all managerial positions, and completed an organizational
skills audit. To align with international best practice on
recruitment and hiring, ADB procured a talent acquisition
system that allows for better management of recruitment,
and improves the pre-screening process. ADB also
deployed sector and procurement staff to field offices, and
created new positions in large field missions—such as the
Bangladesh, India, People’s Republic of China, Pakistan, and
Viet Nam resident missions—to strengthen the capacity of
these offices in project implementation, procurement, and
portfolio management.

ADB conducted a comprehensive market-based review of
salaries, benefits, and other compensation. The total ADB
remuneration package for international staff was considered
to be on par with market rates, and to be highly competitive
for national and administrative staff. With some changes to
ADB benefits endorsed by the Board of Directors, ADB will
conduct a comprehensive review of pension and medical
plans in 2016.

Learning and Development

To address the skills and knowledge ADB needs today and

to support the development of staff in the future, ADB
created a learning framework that works across four aspects
of personal development: self-management, business
knowledge and skills, people management, and business
leadership. The framework allows staff to gradually develop
their skills. A curriculum was developed to improve the
leadership and management skills of ADB team leaders, and
training was delivered to maximize knowledge-sharing among
the field offices of DMCs.

In 2015, 26 graduate students entered the ADB Internship
Program. The interns, who were of 12 different nationalities,
were able to experience working in a major international
organization and gain a deeper understanding of
development work. ADB acknowledges and appreciates

the contribution made by these young people during their
internships.

The ADB Secondment Program hosted about 30 secondees
throughout the year, continuing to stimulate the transfer

of knowledge and experience between development
organizations.

ADB operates knowledge groups based on particular sectors
and development themes. In 2015, these sector and thematic
groups implemented 50 learning programs, benefiting more
than 1,300 ADB staff, including 500 from field offices, and
more than 1,800 representatives of DMCs.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 45MAKING THE MOST OF ADB RESOURCES

Internal Administrative Expenses

Net internal administrative expenses totaled
$551.4 million in 2015. This represents a
utilization rate of 89.3% against the original
budget of $617.7 million and 89.8% against the
midyear estimate of $613.9 million. ADB achieved
savings of $66.3 million in 2015, due to the
rigorous implementation of efficiency measures
and close monitoring of the use of budgetary
resources, favorable external factors (including
inflation and exchange rates), and lower-thanprojected utilization in some of the budget items
due to reprioritization of activities. ADB realized
savings in the following expense items: staff
costs (salaries and benefits); staff development;
relocation; business travel; representation;

and several administrative expenses accounts
such as communications, office occupancy,
office supplies, equipment maintenance,
contractual services, depreciation, and
miscellaneous expenses.

The net internal administrative expenses budget
for 2016 is $635.6 million. The increase of 3.5% is
well below the 10-year historical average of 7.3%.
A significant portion of the incremental increase
will be absorbed through staffing optimization
and intensified efficiency and cost-saving
measures to contain budget growth. The 2016
budget will support preparation for the scaling
up of operations, actions to strengthen portfolio
management, and continuing implementation

of the MTR Action Plan. The 2016 budget also
includes an annual capital budget of $9.1 million
to fund recurring capital requirements of
headquarters and field offices.

Strengthening Risk Management

ADB maintains a corporate culture that is acutely
risk aware. It implements business processes that
allow departments and offices to monitor, mitigate,
and manage specific risks associated with their
operations.

In 2015, ADB paid particular attention to risk
management issues associated with the merger
of the lending operations of the Asian
Development Fund with the institution’s ordinary
capital resources. While this merger will enable
ADB to direct greater resources to the countries
most in need, it has the potential to increase
significantly ADB’s exposure to risk. During the
year, ADB conducted an advance review of its
prudential risk management policies to anchor its
AAA credit rating.

46 ANNUAL REPORT 2015

ADB continued to devote substantial resources
to managing its credit, market, and operational
risks. It also provided technical assistance

to financial institutions in Southeast Asia to
expand their knowledge and capabilities in risk
management.

Audit

Through independent and objective audit and
advisory services, the ADB Office of the Auditor
General provides assurance that the internal
controls for managing risks and achieving ADB’s
development objectives are operating effectively.

In 2015, the office issued 18 audit reports, covering
sovereign and nonsovereign operations, risk
management, treasury, information technology,
and finance and administration. It also completed
10 advisory engagements on financial and
operational controls of business units.

The office expanded the use of data analytics on
audits in 2015 and, in August, released a 5-year
review of internal audit activities financed by
ADB in DMCs. In September, the office hosted
the annual meeting of heads of audits of United
Nations agencies and multilateral financial
institutions. This was the first time ADB had
hosted the event, which was attended by

70 representatives from 42 agencies.

Integrity and Anticorruption Activities
ADB promotes action to prevent corruption in
activities it finances, supports, or administers.

In 2015, ADB held 68 integrity-focused training
events for staff and officials from DMCs.

In October, ADB conducted a workshop to
strengthen the capacity of nonbank financial
institutions to implement international standards
for anti-money laundering and combating the
financing of terrorism. ADB also revised private
sector integrity due diligence guidelines in

July and issued instructions on due diligence
requirements for relevant public sector projects to
staff in October to ensure that integrity risks are
considered in all aspects of ADB operations.

ADB’s integrity team developed 48 knowledge
products throughout the year. These included
simplified checklists, reports, and advisories, to
share insights and lessons learned from integrity
investigations and procurement-related reviews.

In 2015, 196 entities were barred from
participating in future projects or activities
financed, administered, or supported by ADB due
to integrity violations.Lo7-N BI ene)

 

Expanding and Optimizing
ADB’s Workforce

As it scales up to meet new development challenges,
ADB must do all it can to make the most of existing
resources while trying to project future skills needs and
staffing levels. In 2015, ADB completed a workload
and workforce analysis to determine existing gaps

and future requirements as it continues to implement
the recommendations from the Midterm Review of
Strategy 2020.

The workload and workforce analysis comprised
quantitative and qualitative assessments of staffing,
supported by surveys focused on departmental
outputs and staff’s contribution to the delivery of those
outputs. The assessments revealed a need to distribute
staff resources better across particular departments,
divisions, and field offices, when the respective
workloads of each was taken into consideration. For
example, field offices were not all equally resourced to
administer the portfolios delegated to them. Findings
also indicated imbalances in workloads between
individual staff members. The workload and workforce
analysis also proposed areas for reform in ADB’s
workforce planning and management such as 3-year
strategic departmental staffing plans and staff sharing
across departments.

Indicative staffing requirements for 2016-2018 are
projected to be about 290, of which 130 staff positions
are expected to be met through new positions. The
estimate takes into account the need to cover existing
staffing shortfalls, deliver operational pipelines for
2016-2018, and allow scope to further optimize the
use of existing staffing resources. Should the scaling
up of operations follow a more ambitious trajectory
starting in 2017, staffing will be reassessed.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 47Independent Evaluation

In 2015, the Independent Evaluation Department (IED)

at ADB conducted an important evaluation on the Asian
Development Fund (ADF). The review fed directly into
negotiations for the next replenishment that will cover 20172020 when the ADF becomes a grant-only mechanism after
the merger. The evaluation report offered suggestions on the
replenishment process and the deployment of ADB staff.

It also outlined an operational approach for ADB to foster
inclusive and sustainable development in Asia’s poorest and
most vulnerable countries.

IED finalized country program evaluations for the
People’s Republic of China in August and for Papua New
Guinea in February. Their findings and recommendations
contributed to the strategic and operational directions of
ADB for the two countries. At the thematic level, evaluative
work on regional cooperation and integration (RCI) will
feed into an operational plan to strengthen the impact of
RCI work. The corporate evaluation on small Pacific island
countries suggested a sharper focus on how ADB engages
with smaller island countries and those affected by fragile
and conflict-affected situations.

In September, IED hosted an international conference
“Think Sustainable, Act Responsible” at the ADB
headquarters in Manila. Sustainability is a key dimension
of evaluation practice. The conference discussed
macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability, project or
investment sustainability, and environmental sustainability.
The event attracted over 300 participants from 18 countries.

Administrative Services

In October, ADB completed an assessment of how it might
best continue its core operations in the face of major
disruption to business such as a natural disaster. The
assessment team reviewed 585 business processes across
27 departments and identified 33 priority business
operations that require preventive actions or mitigation
strategies to strengthen ADB’s ability to recover.

To support the sustainable development growth agenda,
ADB is committed to reducing its environmental footprint.
In November, ADB received recertification of its integrated
management system for energy, environment, health, and
safety at its Manila headquarters, from TUV SUD—a global
testing, certification, inspection, and training provider.

In December, the building received gold certification in
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design from the

U.S. Green Building Council for new construction of its third
atrium extension.

Information Technology

ADB invested $7 million in 2015 to upgrade its information
technology infrastructure, telecommunications, and remote
access facilities, and to improve internal management
applications. Internet bandwidth capacity in field offices
doubled in 2015, while nevertheless achieving significant cost
reduction for ADB. This has further enabled the decentralization
of ADB operations from headquarters to its field offices.

To shorten processing times for withdrawals by its
borrowers, grant recipients, and their executing agencies,
ADB implemented a secure internet-based portal, allowing
withdrawal applications to be submitted online.

Enhancing Mutual Understanding

ADB’s ombudsperson is a neutral, independent, and confidential
resource available to all staff to informally resolve workplace
concerns.

In 2015, more than 170 ADB staff members from headquarters
and field offices contacted the ombudsperson to discuss
workplace issues. The ombudsperson also visited nine ADB
field offices to raise awareness of the ombudsperson’s services
and to provide an opportunity for face-to-face consultations
with staff.

In January, ADB initiated a collaborative study with the
Harvard Negotiation and Mediation Clinical Program to ensure
the ombudsperson’s services are adequately serving staff. In
response to the study, the ombudsperson’s office strengthened
its reach, increased ways for staff to make contact, and moved
to a more discreet and accessible location within ADB.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

lorin, Javed Talat, MartaMESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP
AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

The challenges we face today offer risks and opportunities: historic changes
in the Middle East and North Africa; high and volatile food and fuel prices;
rising inflation in emerging markets with some danger of overheating; the
ravages caused by natural disasters—as well as better prospects for inclusive, sustainable development, leading to the creation of multiple poles of
global growth; rising private and public investment in infrastructure, creating jobs today and higher productivity tomorrow; the recoveries of fragile
states, often coming out of conflict; and the benefits of greater transparency and openness.

As The World Bank Annual Report 2011 portrays, helping developing
countries meet these challenges, manage the risks, and seize the opportunities has been central to our work over the past year. Our support goes
beyond financial support and development advice. Increasingly, the Bank
Group is linking developing countries so they can share knowledge gained
from their experiences.

This year, we have been urging the world to “put food first.” Higher
food prices have pushed 44 million more people into extreme poverty.
To help alleviate soaring food prices and increase agricultural productivity, the Bank Group has boosted its spending on agriculture to about
$6 billion-$8 billion a year, from $4.1 billion in 2008. The Global Food Crisis
Response Program is helping some 40 million people in 44 countries
through $1.5 billion in support. We are strong supporters of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), and serve as
Trustee for its new Fund. The Bank Group is also playing a leading advocacy
role on food security, urging the Group of 20 (G-20) for global action.

We continue to support the poor and vulnerable through efficient and
effective safety nets and conditional cash transfer systems (CCTs). Our programs support over three dozen countries by strengthening CCTs and sharing knowledge around the globe of how to make these systems effective.
We are working across multiple sectors—health, nutrition, education, and
social protection—with a renewed focus on systems, access, and results.

Africa is back on a path of strong growth—above its precrisis growth
rate. For the third successive year the Bank has been able to provide a record level of support ($7 billion) to the region. The Bank also released its
new Africa Strategy this year, crafted through extensive research and consultations, especially with the people in Africa. The strategy marks a shift in
the way we approach the region, with a new focus on partnership, knowledge, and finance.

The G-20 had tasked the Bank Group to work with others on analyzing
how best to mobilize sources of climate change financing. We are now
helping 130 countries on adaptation and mitigation. We have raised about
$64 billion for our Climate Investment Funds, and they have catalyzed

about $50 billion in total climate finance. The Bank Group has also increased financing of ecosystem and
biodiversity services. At the Nagoya
Biodiversity Summit in September, we
launched an innovation to “green” national accounts by putting the value
of natural resources into how a country measures its economy.

Our most recent World Development Report (2011) is helping to focus
further attention on efforts to promote
stability, and then growth and opportunity, in those fragile, often postconflict states that are home to the world’s
poorest. Our research proposes strengthening national institutions and
improving governance through a focus on citizen security, justice, and
jobs. We are now concentrating on how to adapt our operations to meet
these needs, including increasing staffing and opening a practice hub in
Nairobi.

The Bank Group has been focused on events in the Middle East and
North Africa this year, where we have seen the impact and challenges
posed by citizens demanding change. The region's people deserve a new
social contract that gives them a bigger say in their future, justice, and jobs.
Our rapid response draws on learning, experience, and flexibility—while
recognizing the long-term challenges. Thus we are emphasizing shortterm job creation connected to long-term job investment; boosting trade
to strengthen investment; and targeted safety nets to ensure the most
vulnerable are not forgotten. To help the Arab Republic of Egypt and
Tunisia, the Bank Group announced up to $6 billion in new support over
the next two years.

As a Group, we continue to focus on infrastructure—our largest investment sector—as well as efforts to connect investment to private sector
financing, which include supporting public private partnerships. This year,
together with the Government of Singapore, we launched the Infrastructure Finance Center of Excellence. The center combines global knowledge
from developed and developing economies with the Bank Group's operational and technical expertise to provide customized services to governments as they develop mechanisms to finance infrastructure, including
with more private capital.

The Bank's cooperation with IFC and MIGA is a key part of our overall
development work because the private sector can be a driver of change,growth, and opportunity in developing countries. We support private sector investment across the agricultural value chain, in telecom development,
and to broaden financial inclusion; and we are connecting the private sector to investments in health services, infrastructure, education, and training—all of which are making important contributions to job creation.

We see rapidly expanding South-South exchanges of financial resources, development experience, and trade and investment opportunities. The Bank Group is learning from these exchanges, and increasing our
efforts to expand new knowledge, financial innovation, and fresh approaches to all poor countries. Our strong Treasury team is keeping funding costs low, and passing on the benefits to clients.

Moreover, we have thrown open the doors to our knowledge. The Bank
Group's groundbreaking Access to Information Policy has set a new standard for transparency among international institutions, and our Open Data
Initiative gives access, free of charge, to more than 7,000 data sets. This year
the Bank Group scored the highest ratings on aid transparency among 30
leading multilateral and bilateral aid agencies.

We continue to integrate our governance and anticorruption agenda
into all of the Bank Group's work across countries, sectors, and projects. We
have also strengthened our enforcement over the past year, with major
debarments to hold firms accountable for wrongdoing, and new cooperation agreements with international agencies to help counter corruption
and ensure more effective prosecutions. In addition, we are strengthening
our preventive measures, helping Bank staff identify “red flags” in procurement and better manage integrity risks in development projects.

The World Bank Group continues to operate under a real flat budget,
for the seventh consecutive year, even as we are dealing with larger volumes of business. We are using each available dollar to support poor and
developing countries.

During fiscal 2011 the Bank Group committed $57.3 billion in loans,
grants, equity investments, and guarantees to its members and to private
businesses. IBRD commitments totaled $26.7 billion compared with $44.2
billion in 2010, but still above precrisis levels. IDA, the Bank's fund for the
poorest countries, made commitments of $16.3 billion, a 12 percent increase over last year. Support from IFC increased by 3 percent to $12.2 billion, and MIGA issued $2.1 billion in guarantees, a 43 percent increase over
fiscal 2010.

In addition, this year a broadened coalition of 51 donors pledged a
record-breaking IDA16 replenishment of $49.3 billion for the next three
fiscal years—an increase of 18 percent over IDA15. Moreover, our shareholders approved the first general capital increase for the Bank Group in
more than 20 years, along with a selective capital increase, boosting our
capital by more than $86 billion.

None of the work we do would be possible without the dedication of
the World Bank Group's staff in Washington and in our country offices, with
whose commitment we are transforming into a more dynamic, flexible,
open, and innovative institution. Thank you. | am also grateful to our Board
of Executive Directors, the Governors, and our many contributors and partners for their ongoing support and counsel.

This Annual Report, which covers the period from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2011, has been prepared by the Executive Directors of both the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA)—collectively known as the World Bank—in accordance with the respective bylaws of the two institutions.
Robert B. Zoellick, President of IBRD and IDA, and Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors, has submitted this report, together with the accompanying administrative budgets

and audited financial statements, to the Board of Governors.

Annual reports for the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment

Disputes (ICSID) are published separately.

All dollar amounts used in this Annual Report are current U.S. dollars unless otherwise specified. As a result of rounding, numbers in tables may not add to totals and percentages in
figures may not add to 100. Throughout this report, the terms “World Bank" and “Bank" refer to IBRD and IDA. “World Bank Group’ refers collectively to IBRD, IDA, IFC, MIGA, and ICSID.THE ROLE OF IBRD

The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is a
global development cooperative owned by 187 countries. It works with its
members to achieve equitable and sustainable economic growth in their
national economies and to find solutions to pressing regional and global
problems in economic development and in other important areas such as
environmental sustainability. It pursues its overriding goal—to overcome
poverty and improve standards of living—primarily by providing loans,
risk management products, and expertise on development-related disciplines and by coordinating responses to regional and global challenges.
(See http://www.worldbank.org/ibrd.)

IBRD Financial Commitments and Services

New lending commitments by IBRD reached $26.7 billion, including 132
operations, in fiscal 2011—significantly more than the historical average
($13.5 billion in fiscal 2005-08). This follows the record $44.2 billion in fiscal
2010 when the crisis peaked. Latin America and the Caribbean received
the largest share of IBRD’s new lending ($9.2 billion), followed by East Asia
and Pacific ($6.4 billion), and Europe and Central Asia ($5.5 billion). Among
sectors, Public Administration, Law, and Justice received the highest share
of commitments (22 percent), followed by Transportation (19 percent),
Energy and Mining (17 percent), and Health and Other Social Services (17
percent). The themes receiving the largest commitments were Financial
and Private Sector Development ($5.6 billion), Environment and Natural
Resources Management ($5 billion), and Social Protection and Risk Management ($3.9 billion).

IBRD also offers financial products that allow clients to efficiently fund
their development programs and manage risks related to currency, interest rates, Commodity prices, and natural disasters. In fiscal 2011 the Bank's
Treasury executed U.S. dollar equivalent (USDeq) 5.6 billion in hedging
transactions on behalf of member countries, including USDeq 5.5 billion in
interest rate hedges and USDeq 60 million in currency hedges (all local
currency conversions). It also executed swap transactions totaling USDeq

68 billion to manage the risks of its balance sheet. In addition, Treasury
executed USDeq 2.5 billion in swaps on behalf of the International Finance
Facility for Immunisation and USDeq 7.2 billion in swaps for IDA.

IBRD Resources

IBRD obtains most of its funds by issuing bonds in international capital
markets. In fiscal 2011 it raised USDeq 29 billion by issuing bonds in 26
currencies. Because of its standing in the capital markets and its financial
strength, IBRD was able to borrow these large volumes on very favorable
terms despite volatile market conditions. The Bank's strength is based on
IBRD's prudent financial policies and practices, which help maintain its
triple-A credit rating. As a cooperative institution, IBRD seeks not to maximize profit but to earn enough income to ensure its financial strength and
sustain its development activities. IBRD’s allocable net income rose to
$996 million in fiscal 2011, up from $764 million in fiscal 2010.

Consistent with IBRD's development mandate, the principal risk it takes
is the country credit risk inherent in its portfolio of loans and guarantees.
One summary measure of the Bank's risk profile is the ratio of equity to
loans and long-term investment assets, which is closely managed in line
with the Bank's financial and risk outlook. This ratio stood at 28.7 percent as
of June 30, 2011. To enhance IBRD’s financial capacity, the Development
Committee endorsed a package of measures, including an $86.2 billion
general and selective capital increase, with $5.1 billion in paid-in capital,
and the Board of Governors approved the capital increase resolutions in
March 2011.

THE ROLE OF IDA

The International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's fund
for the poorest countries, is the largest multilateral channel of concessional
financing to the world. Its funding supports countries’ efforts to boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve the living conditions of the
poor. This fiscal year 79 countries were eligible to receive IDA assistance.

IDA commitments reached $16.3 billion in fiscal 2011, including $13.45
billion in credits and $2.82 billion in grants. The largest share of resources
was committed to Africa, which received $7.0 billion. South Asia ($6.4 billion) and East Asia and Pacific ($1.6 billion) also received large shares of
committed funding. Bangladesh ($2.1 billion) and India ($2.1 billion) were
the largest country recipients.

Commitments for infrastructure rose to $6.9 billion, a 28 percent increase over fiscal 2010. Significant support was also committed to the
Public Administration, Law, and Justice sector ($3.7 billion) and to Health
and Other Social Services ($2.2 billion). The themes receiving the largest
commitments were Rural Development ($3.0 billion), Financial and Private
Sector Development ($2.4 billion), and Urban Development ($2.0 billion).

IDA Resources

IDA is financed largely by contributions from donor governments. Additional financing comes from transfers from IBRD’'s net income, grants from
IFC, and borrowers’ repayment of earlier IDA credits. Every three years donor governments and representatives of borrower countries meet to discuss IDA’s policies and priorities and to agree on the volume of new resources required to fund its lending program over the subsequent three
fiscal years. Under the 15th Replenishment (IDA15), which covered fiscal
2009-11, total resources were $43.7 billion, including new donor contributions of $25.7 billion and donor Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative compensation of $4.9 billion.

Discussions for the IDA16 replenishment concluded in December
2010, resulting in a record-level envelope of 32.8 billion special drawing
rights (SDR) (equivalent to $49.3 billion using the IDA16 replenishment
exchange rate). Funding sources for IDA16, which covers fiscal 2012-14,
include donor resources of SDR 17.6 billion ($26.4 billion) from 52 countries, including 7 new donors; donor compensation for debt forgiveness
of SDR 3.5 billion ($5.3 billion); credit reflows of SDR 9.7 billion ($14.6 billion), including funds from accelerated credit repayments and hardening
of credit terms; and transfers from within the World Bank Group, including
associated investment income, of SDR 2.0 billion ($3.0 billion).

The overarching theme and main focus of IDA16 is the achievement,
enhanced monitoring, and communication of development results, with
stronger emphasis on the measurement of results. Special themes include
crisis response, gender issues, climate change, and fragile and conflictaffected countries. IDA16 includes funding for a dedicated crisis response
window to help low-income countries deal with the impact of natural
disasters and severe economic shocks. The new replenishment will also
help recipient countries adapt to the negative impacts of climate change
and strengthen the Bank’s engagement in postconflict states.

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2011 5POSTCRISIS DIRECTIONS

REAL-TIME RESPONSE TO RENEWED CHALLENGES

The impact of the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great
Depression ebbed in 2010, as world output increased by an estimated
3.9 percent, led by strong domestic demand in developing countries.
The bounce-back is projected to slow to 3.3 percent in 2011 before picking up to 3.6 percent in 2012.

In contrast to many high-income countries and countries in Europe and
Central Asia where growth remains sluggish, most developing countries
have recovered—or are in the process of recovering—to precrisis levels.
Rising South-South investments, particularly investments originating in Asia,
have played an important role in the rebound. The economies of Brazil,
China, India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, and the Russian Federation
are poised to account for more than half of all global growth by 2025. They
will help drive growth in lower-income countries through cross-border
commercial and financial transactions, according to a new World Bank report, Global Development Horizons.

An Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) assessment of the World Bank’s
response to the crisis showed that the principal recipients of Bank lending
were middle-income countries. With these countries leading the global
recovery, this engagement shows the part that the Bank now plays in stabilizing world economic growth. In its evaluation IEG concluded that taking a strategic approach, balancing capital adequacy, and effectively deploying resources have had clear benefits in the crisis recovery.

The waning of the crisis, which affected developed countries even
more than developing countries, did not usher in a new era of stability. The
world is facing tremendous new risks and challenges, including high food
prices; rising fuel prices, which increase the price of food and threaten social stability; political upheaval in the Middle East and North Africa; natural
disasters; climate change; slowed growth in the developed world; accelerating inflation in emerging markets; and sovereign debt issues in Europe
For the poor, by far the greatest peril is high and volatile food prices.

Facing Higher Food Prices

New pressures on the poor in developing countries emerged as food
prices rose by double digits, almost reaching the record levels of 2008.
Food price increases from June to December 2010 resulted in an estimated
overall net increase in the number of poor by 44 million people in developing countries. Globally, the prices of wheat, maize, sugar, and food oil
rose sharply, and in many developing countries, food prices are now the
key challenge. All major agricultural outlooks forecast that at least until
2019, international food prices will remain above the prices of the previous decade.

The Global Food Price Crisis Response Program, established by the Bank
in May 2008, provided immediate relief to countries hard hit by high food
prices. Through June 2011 the program had approved $1,500.1 million; 77
percent had been disbursed. Total Bank-funded, Board-approved projects
under the program amounted to more than $1.2 billion, including $202.4
million from the Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund (for 27 countries, 17
of them in Africa); $835.8 million from IDA (for 13 countries); and $200 million from IBRD (for a project in the Philippines). The program was recently
extended for one more year, until June 2012, to allow for a swift response
to calls for assistance from countries heavily impacted by the rising food
prices.

6 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2011

 

An elderly Croatian woman shops for vegetables in a Zagreb market. High and
volatile food prices, nearing 2008 records, now represent the key development
challenge for many countries.

The Bank also administers the Global Agriculture and Food Security
Program, which focuses on mid- to long-term initiatives. Created in April
2010 at the request of the Group of 20 (G-20), this program funds countryled agriculture and food security plans and helps promote investments in
smallholder agriculture in low-income countries. Since its launch, the program has awarded $481 million in grants to 12 countries.

A range of measures is also helping to sustain nutrition among vulnerable groups. The Bank is working with the World Food Programme to
help feed 22 million children in about 60 countries, as well as coordinating
efforts with United Nations agencies through the High-Level Task Force
on the Global Food Security Crisis and with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).

Meeting the MDGs

Before the crisis many countries and regions had made substantial progress
toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Globally, deaths of
children under age five have declined in developing countries, falling from
101 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 73 in 2008. Primary education enrollment has increased, although poor children and children in rural areas have
benefited less than children elsewhere. Rapid growth has occurred in East
Asia and Pacific, and poverty rates have been dropping in South Asia.

Bank support has made a significant difference in results. To improve
education, the Bank has committed nearly $25.3 billion, including more
than $13.3 billion for IDA countries, since 2000. IDA support for education
was $1.1 billion in new commitments in fiscal 2011.

World Development Indicators 2010 found that the target to reduce by
half the number of people living in extreme poverty is within reach, thanks
in part to rapid economic growth in Asia. However, at the country level,
only 49 of 87 countries are on track to achieve the poverty target. High,
unstable food prices are hampering progress toward the MDGs, primarily
those related to health but also those MDGs that food prices affect indi-rectly, such as education. High food prices are increasing hunger and malnutrition, leaving millions of children too weak to attend school.

Improving Risk Management and Disaster Recovery Response
Exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices have been volatile in
recent years, and natural disasters have had particularly severe effects on
growing urban areas (see below). In addition to supporting safety net programs, the Bank is providing client countries with risk management strategies and financial products that help reduce their vulnerabilities.

This fiscal year the Bank provided 40 countries with financial products and advisory services on public debt management. The volume of
risk management transactions the Bank executed on behalf of client
countries to manage the volatility of currencies and interest rates was
USDegq 5.6 billion.

Addressing Youth Unemployment
Youth unemployment is a serious problem in many developing regions. It is
most severe in the Middle East and North Africa, where more than 40 percent of young people in some countries are jobless. Young urban men are
at a particular disadvantage in the labor market, with many underemployed,
employed in off-the-books informal work, or not employed at all. Youth
unemployment not only increases poverty, it also leads to political turmoil
and causes undesirable social consequences, such as low marriage rates.
The long-standing problem of youth unemployment has been exacerbated by the region's recent revolutions.

The Bank is conducting research in the Arab Republic of Egypt, Jordan,
and Morocco on the main trends in employment and social outcomes

for young people. This work has involved piloting job-creating programs,
collecting data, and developing new instruments, such as a tool for measuring youth participation in the labor market and community life.

Under the umbrella of its Arab World Initiative, the Bank is also working
with the League of Arab States to jump-start youth programs, including
voluntary service, in the region. A proposed grant would help the league
and several countries implement the programs.

In October 2010, 18 Arab states signed the Doha Declaration on
Education Quality, committing them to implement a system for evaluating
schools, teachers, and students and to make results publicly available.
Countries are also seeking ways to bring disaffected youth back into the
educational system and to increase their involvement in communities and
society. Morocco’s National Human Development Initiative, for instance,
provides funding to programs that shelter orphans, street children, and
other vulnerable populations. The Bank is backing many of these national
efforts with financing, policy advice, and analytical work.

The problem of unemployment is not limited to the Middle East and
North Africa or to the young. The base unemployment rate is high in
many African countries, and youth in Africa are three times more likely to
be unemployed than adults age 25 and older. In Indonesia more than 20
percent of workers ages 15-24 are unemployed—five times the rate for
older workers.

EDUCATION, HEALTH, AND SOCIAL PROTECTION AND LABOR

In the face of continuing challenges, including high food prices and unemployment, in fiscal 2011 the Human Development Network assisted client
countries and their development partners to help them work toward the

REDUCING THE HUMAN AND PHYSICAL COSTS OF NATURAL DISASTERS

Storms, floods, earthquakes, and droughts
caused more than 3.3 million deaths and $2.3
trillion (in 2008 dollars) in damage between 1970
and 2008—and projections indicate that the human and material costs will rise significantly.
Even without climate change, damage from
weather-related hazards may triple to $185 billion a year by 2100, according to Natural Hazards,
UnNatural Disasters: The Economics of Effective
Prevention, a World Bank-United Nations report
released this fiscal year. Factoring in losses from
climate change could add another $28 billion—
$68 billion from tropical cyclones alone. These
projections mean that prevention is more important than ever, a finding echoed by IEG in several
real-time evaluations it made public following
the floods in Pakistan in July and August 2010.
The Bank is actively helping client countries
prevent, mitigate, and recover from natural disasters. After flooding devastated Pakistan, the
national government requested the assistance
of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank,
and other donors in assessing the damage. To
facilitate access to and disseminate data to ex
perts in 17 sectors in the various institutions
involved in the damage and needs assessment,
the Bank established a web-based virtual data
center. Created through Lotus Quickr, the
“Teamroom” can be accessed not only by Bank
staff but also by people outside the Bank who
register through the Bank's administrator. By
maintaining communication with data teams in
the field, coordinating across sector teams, ensuring the quality and consistency of the data by
developing a comprehensive data-posting protocol, and keeping stakeholders apprised of all
data uploaded, the Bank played a critical role in
identifying what needed to be done following
the disaster.

Following the January 2011 mudslides in the
state of Rio de Janeiro that killed more than
800 people and left thousands more without
homes, the Bank approved a $485 million housing project to benefit 2 million people who lived
in informal low-income settlements there. The
project will also help the government better
manage disaster risks and improve planning and
territorial growth management.

Immediately after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan that killed more
than 15,000 people, the Bank expressed its
readiness to provide support, noting its extensive experience in disaster risk management and
ability to mobilize and deploy specialists to support recovery and reconstruction efforts. It also
monitored the potential economic impacts.

The financial protection of the state in the
event of natural disasters is gaining increasing
attention among developing countries, the donor community, and international financial institutions. This fiscal year clients continued to
take advantage of the Bank's disaster risk financing services. Colombia responded quickly to
emergency needs with the help of funds available through a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (Cat DDO) after the country’s
worst rainy season in decades caused massive
floods and landslides. Two other countries (El
Salvador and Peru) also signed Cat DDOs this
fiscal year.

Education

As one of the largest external funders of education in the developing world,
the Bank is a key player in global efforts to reach the education MDGs—
universal primary completion and gender parity—and to achieve quality
learning for all. The Bank invested more than $1.7 billion in education this
fiscal year and currently manages a portfolio of $11.2 billion. At the UN
Summit on the MDGs in September 2010, the Bank pledged to increase its
IDA resources for basic education by $750 million over the following five
years to assist countries not on track to reach the goals by 2015, particularly
in Africa and South Asia. (See http://worldbank.org/education.)

Thanks in part to Bank support, three-quarters of the countries in East
Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America and the
Caribbean have met or are on track to meet the education MDGs. During
the past decade the total number of out-of-school children worldwide
declined from 106 million to 69 million, and net primary enrollment in
Africa rose from 58 percent to 76 percent. Since 2000 IDA financing for
the world’s poorest has helped recruit or train 3 million additional teachers
and build more than 2 million new classrooms—benefiting more than 100
million children every year.

In April 2011 the Bank launched its Education Strategy 2020, Learning
for All: Investing in People’s Knowledge and Skills to Promote Development,
a road map for the next 10 years that emphasizes the need to invest early,
invest smartly, and invest for all. The Bank will focus on working in strategic
partnerships to help developing countries strengthen education systems
beyond inputs and to build a global knowledge base for reform. New tools
for assessing education systems will benchmark education policies according to evidence-based global standards and best practice, from early
childhood development to higher education and beyond.

Collaboration with a host of development partners, including the
Education for All-Fast Track Initiative, United Nations Education, Scientific,
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF), advances the global commitment to achieve the goals of
the Education for All Initiative and the education MDGs. The Bank also
partners with the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID)
to strengthen the evidence base for what works in education policy, and
through the Russia Education Aid for Development (READ) trust fund, to
build capacity for learning assessment.

Health, Nutrition, and Population

New investments in health, nutrition, and population programs totaled
almost $3 billion in fiscal 2011. The portfolio is at a historic high of $10.8
billion, more than half of which goes to the world’s poorest countries.
Investments in these programs help strengthen health systems; boost the
prevention and treatment of communicable diseases; improve child and
maternal health, nutrition, hygiene, and sanitation; and protect the poor
from the impoverishing effects of high and unpredictable out-of-pocket
spending.

IDA commitments during the past decade have provided more than
47 million people with access to the basic package of health, nutrition,
and population services; helped deliver antiretroviral therapies to almost
2 million adults and children with HIV; provided 2.5 million pregnant
women with antenatal care; immunized 310 million children; provided 98
million children with targeted interventions to improve nutrition; purchased or distributed 813 million condoms and almost 33 million mosquito nets; constructed, renovated, or equipped 23,000 health facilities;
and trained 1.8 million health personnel.

The Bank has positioned itself as a global leader in several priority
areas. Through its Reproductive Health Action Plan for 2010-15, it is working with 57 high-priority countries to improve reproductive health by
strengthening health systems and demand, focusing on youth and the
poor. The Bank is a key player in implementing the Scaling-Up Nutrition
Framework, which it developed with the support of the Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation and the government of Japan, and which has been endorsed by more than 100 partner agencies, institutions, and civil society
groups. More than a dozen countries have declared themselves “early
risers” in their commitment to implementing the framework.

The World Bank's multidonor Health Results Innovations Trust Fund
(HRITF) supports Results-Based Financing (RBF) approaches in the health
sector for achievement of the health-related MDGs. The governments
of Norway and the United Kingdom have committed $575 million to
the HRITF through 2022. The fund supports the design, implementation,
monitoring, and evaluation of RBF approaches; develops and disseminates
evidence for implementing successful approaches; builds country institutional capacity to scale up and sustain these approaches within the national health strategy and system; and attracts additional financing to the
health sector. (See http://worldbank.org/hnp.)

Since 2006 the Bank has assisted developing countries in preparing
for and controlling avian influenza outbreaks in animals and in prepar-ing for an influenza pandemic. The $1.3 billion Global Program for Avian
Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response has
supported the prevention of pandemic influenza and similar diseases
through projects in 60 countries. (See http://worldbank.org/flu.)

HIV/AIDS

The Bank is actively engaged in helping countries halt and then begin
to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. A total of $108 million of
new lending has been designated for operations that support HIV/AIDSrelated prevention, treatment, and mitigation in Argentina, Burkina Faso,
Kenya, Kyrgyz Republic, Lesotho, Mozambique, Niger, and Swaziland. The
Bank developed five analytical products that strengthened national programs by improving efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability through
evidence-informed responses, and it worked with 40 countries to develop
evidence-based national strategies and action plans.

© build evidence on the impact of activities and programs, the Bank
partnered with DFID to evaluate community responses to HIV/AIDS in
Burkina Faso, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.
This work revealed the power of community efforts, which increased condom use in Kenya, led to higher rates of HIV testing in Senegal, and improved treatment adherence in South Africa.

ogether with the United Nations Development Programme and the
Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the Bank in 2011 completed a study, “The Global HIV Epidemics among Men Who Have Sex
with Men: Epidemiology, Prevention, Access to Care, and Human Rights,’
which found that better HIV/AIDS programs for this group of men
could significantly slow the global epidemic. The study provides the
first comprehensive analysis of evidence that this group is at a significantly higher risk for HIV infection than other groups in many low- and
middle-income countries; worldwide, fewer than one in ten in this group
of men has access to even basic HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment services.

In the past two decades IDA has financed 1,500 counseling and HIV
testing sites, ultimately testing nearly 7 million people. It has funded more
than 65,000 civil society HIV initiatives in Africa aimed at mitigating the
impact of the epidemic among men and women ages 15-24. IDA has
also educated 173 million people about HIV/AIDS and has mitigated the
impact of AIDS for 1.8 million children and half a million adults through
38,000 grassroots initiatives. (See http://worldbank.org/aids.)

 

Social Protection and Labor

The Bank allocated $4 billion to social protection and labor operations this
fiscal year. Funding remained high, as in fiscal 2010 and 2009, at almost
four times the precrisis level of about $1 billion a year. The bulk of the
spending ($3.5 billion) went to 37 social safety net projects in 31 countries.
The largest recipient was Mexico, which received more than $1.2 billion in
Bank funds in continuing support of the Oportunidades conditional cash
transfer program, which benefits 5.8 million of the country’s most vulnerable families. The remaining lending went to improving labor markets and
other social protection areas, such as pensions and disability assistance.
(See http://worldbank.org/sp.)

 

A Colombian woman raises poultry as part of the Bank-supported producers’
alliance in La Eugenia, Valle de Cauca. She now has her own money to pay for

The global economic crisis and continuing volatility underscored the
need for more effective social protection and labor institutions in developing countries. In response the Bank began to develop a new strategy for
the next 10 years, from 2012 to 2022. The strategy will address four major
global gaps in social protection: integration across programs; coverage,
particularly for low-income countries; promoting jobs and human capital
accumulation; and knowledge about the most effective approaches for
strengthening social protection. Global consultations with stakeholders
are being conducted. (See http://worldbank.org/spstrategy.)

This fiscal year a joint policy inventory was launched with the

nternational Labour Organization (ILO), with which the Bank has a longstanding partnership. This initiative involves collecting and analyzing
1,750 policies, including Core Labor Standards, implemented by 52 developing and 22 high-income countries. The analysis will document those
policies that were adopted or reinforced to mitigate the effects of the
financial crisis. In addition, the Bank joined forces with the ILO, the Youth
Employment Network, the German government, and the Inter-American
Development Bank to build a live database on youth employment
programs.
The Rapid Social Response Program, created in 2009 in response to the
food, fuel, and financial crises, went into its second year of operation in
December 2010. By May 2011 it had added 33 new activities to its portfolio
to support crisis preparation in 33 IDA-eligible low-income countries. The
program also supports knowledge management and South-South transfers of knowledge necessary to operationalize effective social protection
systems against crises. (See http://worldbank.org/rsr.)

 

GENDER
Global progress on gender equality remains uneven. In some areas the
pace of improvement has been extraordinary. Globally more women than

POSTCRISIS DIRECTIONS 9Children sit on top of a discarded military tank in rural Ethiopia. Even with
economic recovery, it can take a generation or more to return to prewar living
standards.

men attend universities, and women now outlive men in every region of
the world. At the same time, severe gender disparities remain, including
those in important economic indicators where large gaps have narrowed
only marginally over the past several decades. Access to physical capital,
including land, credit, and other financial services, remains starkly unequal.
In many countries women lack de facto equality before the law, limiting
both their human rights and their opportunity to participate in the economy. (See http://worldbank.org/gender.)

Between 2007 and 2010 the World Bank Group’s Gender Equality as
Smart Economics Action Plan sought to promote women's access to
jobs, land rights, financial services, agricultural inputs, and infrastructure.
By December 2010 the plan had mobilized $70 million for 270 Bank operations in 80 countries. Monitoring now shows a significant increase in the
Bank's attention to gender in these sectors.

In 2011 the Bank launched Applying Gender Action Plan Lessons:
A Three-Year Road Map for Gender Mainstreaming (2011-13). Seeking to
replicate and scale up some of the innovative mechanisms used in the
Gender Action Plan, the Road Map aims to direct more of the Bank's technical assistance, projects, and programs to improving economic opportunities for women. For the three-year period covered, donors agreed to
make gender a special theme for IDA. This designation will help accelerate
the integration of gender into Bank operations and expand the coverage
of gender issues in analytical work and policy dialogue. The IDA results
framework will also be strengthened and expanded to include indicators
for gender priority areas, and IDA will implement an action plan to accelerate progress on the gender-specific MDGs.

Fiscal 2011 saw the expansion of the Adolescent Girls Initiative, launched
in 2009 to promote the transition of adolescent girls from school to productive employment. The program launched a new operation in Jordan in
December 2010, adding to the projects already under way in Afghanistan,

10 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2011

the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Liberia, Nepal, Rwanda, and South
Sudan. During the year, the Adolescent Girls Initiative was also extended to
Haiti and the Republic of Yemen, where operations are under preparation.

The 2012 World Development Report—one of the Bank's annual flagship
reports—will focus for the first time on the relationship between gender
equality and development. This Report, to be released in September 2011,
will argue that gender equality matters for development outcomes and for
development policy making. It will show how gender equality has evolved
over time and across regions and countries—particularly in the past quarter century. WDR 2012 examines why some gender gaps, such as in education, have closed quickly, while others, such as access to economic opportunities and societal voice, remain in most of the world, including in
high-income countries. Finally, it will look at policies that can improve
gender outcomes and highlight gaps in knowledge and data. (See http://
worldbank.org/wdr2012.)

FRAGILE AND CONFLICT-AFFECTED SITUATIONS

Many of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people live in fragile and
conflict-affected countries. People in these countries are more than twice as
likely to be undernourished and to lack clean water as people in other developing countries; and they are more than three times as likely to be unable to send their children to school. None of these countries has achieved
a single Millennium Development Goal, and only 20 percent are on track
to meet the 2015 targets. In an effort to strengthen their performance, the
Bank will concentrate its poverty reduction efforts in these countries.

The World Development Report 2011: Conflict, Security, and Development provides the analytical foundations for improving the Bank's operating model in fragile and conflict-affected situations. It concludes that
building capable and legitimate institutions, ensuring citizen security and
justice, and creating jobs are essential to reducing violence—and providing optimal support requires better coordination among external actors.

The Bank expects to build on the Report analysis in at least six ways:

+ Make country assistance strategies for fragile and conflict-affected
situations (FCS) more focused on fragility. The Bank will seek to identify
more clearly the stresses that lead to conflict; assess the capability of
key national institutions to effectively deal with citizen security, justice, and development; and identify transition opportunities that may
help break the cycles of violence and protracted fragility.

Strengthen partnerships on development, security, and justice. The
Bank will work more closely with other partners, in the spirit of the
Paris and Accra agendas, and particularly with international agencies
that possess expertise the Bank does not, or on areas that are outside
its mandate. The Bank will also partner with others to look at how to
fill current gaps in the international effort and response to FCS, and
build upon its partnerships to strengthen the links between security
and development.

Increase attention to jobs and private sector development. The Bank will
develop an approach to employment in FCS, in partnership with others, that develops a range of interventions to support jobs and livelihoods—both through public and community-based employment
that can provide “quick wins" and through the necessary investmentsPhoto; Curt Carnemark

and research that support private sector development and job creation over time.

+ Realign results and risk management for FCS, away from risk avoidance.
The Bank will review its definitions of risk tolerance, risk management,
and expected results and will examine how it can better balance fiduciary and other risks in FCS against the risks of inaction or slow action,
which may lead to a resurgence of violence and conflict.

+ Reduce financing volatility. Institutional development requires longterm and sustained support. Going forward, the Bank will work to
ensure that essential institutions in FCS receive sustained support
over several years, and will explore options for maintaining minimum
levels of support to core institutions and basic services even in the
context of governance or other setbacks.

+ Strive for global excellence in FCS work. The Bank recognizes the need
for a different organizational approach—both in its internal organization and in its work with regional and global partners—in fragile and
conflict-affected situations. It has been working to put in place the
processes, organizational structure, and staff skill mixes and incentives
to encourage innovation and informed risk taking. In an effort to bring
resources closer to the field, it has created a Global Center for Conflict,
Security, and Development. The center, in Nairobi, will conduct research on economics and public policy matters, and provide substantial support to country teams across all regions on issues related to
security, justice, and development in crisis prevention and recovery.

CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate change threatens to erode development gains around the
world—and its effect will be greatest on the poorest and most vulnerable

 

countries. Supporting low-carbon and climate-resilient poverty reduction
and development has, therefore, moved to the forefront of Bank thinking
and operations. Ninety percent of new country assistance and partnership
strategies emphasize climate action.

Bank-funded low-carbon growth studies in Brazil, China, Colombia,
India, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, and South Africa are supporting efforts to
implement national climate change action plans. The first Low-Carbon
Development Policy Loan for Mexico ($401 million) was approved in
November 2010. A development policy loan for Poland ($1.11 billion), approved in June 2011, supports the energy efficiency and renewable energy
components of the Energy Policy of Poland until 2030 program. The Bank
is funding more than 180 country-led activities in Latin America and the
Caribbean, which will provide climate change adaptation and mitigation
cobenefits estimated to be worth more than $7.3 billion.

Working with Global Partners

In fiscal 2011, in partnership with other multilateral development banks
(MDBs), the Bank ramped up operations and the implementation of
projects under the allocated $6.5 billion Climate Investment Funds (CIF).
This total consists of $4.5 billion dedicated to the Clean Technology Fund
(CTF) and $2 billion to the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF). Trust Fund
Committees have committed $1.7 billion to new projects that support
developing country efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate
change. The CTF is leveraging its funding to achieve further investments
of $36 billion. Every $1 from the CTF leverages $8 of cofinancing from
other sources.

With CTF support, 14 middle-income countries (Algeria, Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, the Philippines, South Africa,
Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, and Vietnam) plan to rebalance their national energy portfolios by investing in renewables on a large scale. Under
the SCF, the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) endorsed investment plans for Bangladesh, Cambodia, Grenada, Mozambique, Nepal,
Niger, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Tajikistan, and
Zambia. Under these plans, approximately $700 million in PPCR funding is
expected to be channeled through the MDBs so that work on adaptation
to climate change is a more regular part of development action.

Also under the SCF in this fiscal year, the Forest Investment Program
endorsed investment plans for Burkina Faso and the Democratic Republic
of Congo with $90 million in grants. With support from the Scaling Up
Renewable Energy Program in Low Income Countries, Ethiopia, Honduras,
Kenya, Maldives, Mali, and Nepal announced their intention to invest in
renewable energy services to expand energy access and leapfrog into
climate-friendly development.

At the UN climate change conference in Cancun in December 2010,
the Bank announced the creation of a Partnership for Market Readiness,
bringing developed and developing countries together to explore and
pilot new market instruments to scale up mitigation efforts. By the end of
fiscal 2011 donors had pledged $70 million to the partnership.

In Cancun a decision was also made to establish a Green Climate Fund
to manage long-term finance mobilized to enable developing countries to
address climate change. The World Bank has been invited to be its interim
trustee.

Promoting Innovative Financing

The World Bank Treasury supports innovative financing flows for climatesmart investment through the funds it raises in capital markets. Since 2008
the Bank has issued more than $2 billion through the issuance of “green
bonds.’ Proceeds from the sales are earmarked for adaptation and mitigation activities in client countries.

The Bank is also the trustee of 12 carbon funds and facilities that support the mitigation of climate change through carbon finance, including
two new facilities that focus on activities beyond the first commitment
period of the Kyoto Protocol, which ends on December 31, 2012. The capital of these funds and facilities amounts to just over $3 billion, of which
$1.9 billion has been committed to purchasing emissions reductions.
Some 174 active projects are expected to reduce emissions by an estimated 220 million metric tons of carbon dioxide or its equivalent in other
greenhouse gases.

The Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, launched in 2008 to support
developing countries in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest
degradation, has received more than $447 million in committed and
pledged funds. The Carbon Partnership Facility, created in May 2010, so far
has committed €143.5 million to scale up the use of carbon finance to accelerate mitigation activities after 2012.

12 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2011

The Bank's latest carbon initiative, the Umbrella Carbon Facility Tranche
2, reached its full capitalization of €105 million in February 2011. The funds
will be used to purchase certified emission reductions generated by carbon projects in developing countries between 2013 and 2018.

Mainstreaming Environmental and

Natural Resource Management Activities

By the end of fiscal 2011 the active portfolio of World Bank projects that
include environmental and natural resource management components
amounted to approximately $18 billion—representing about 11 percent
of the total Bank portfolio that year. The Bank is also developing new tools
to account for and assess the value of the carbon footprint of projects. (See
http://climatechange.worldbank.org.)

DEMONSTRATING GREEN DEVELOPMENT INTERNALLY

Green development is the overarching theme of the new World Bank
Group environment strategy, which is under preparation. The Bank continues to implement a corporate responsibility program to integrate sustainability considerations into its internal operations. This year two Bankowned buildings in Washington, DC, received Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification in recognition of the
Bank's continuous implementation of sustainability practices guided by
this green building standard.

The Bank's priorities in corporate sustainability fall into five categories: reducing its corporate carbon footprint, managing sustainable
facilities, engaging in sustainable procurement, raising the awareness of
its staff, and increasing transparency to its stakeholders. As part of its
commitment to reduce its corporate carbon footprint and to maintain
carbon neutrality, the Bank measures, reduces, offsets, and reports on
the greenhouse gas emissions associated with its global facilities, major
meetings, and air travel. To manage sustainable facilities, it strives to
maximize the efficiency with which it uses resources, such as water,
food, energy, and landfill space. To ensure that its procurement is sustainable, the Bank proactively integrates sustainability principles into major corporate procurements such as paper and computers. To raise staff
awareness, the Bank holds outreach and learning events that encourage
changes in behavior. To increase transparency on its environmental and
social performance, it provides regular sustainability-related reports in
adherence with international standards such as the Global Reporting
Initiative and Carbon Disclosure Project. (See http://crinfo.worldbank
.org/home.)

In the field, an increasing number of Bank country offices are leading
by example by adopting environmental initiatives. For example, the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia country office has showcased various
carbon footprint reduction initiatives—aiming to be a model in support
of the country’s drive for accession to the European Union.

AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT

Three of every four poor people in developing countries live in rural areas.
Most depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, directly or indirectly.
GDP growth originating in agriculture is about two to four times moreeffective in raising the incomes of extremely poor people than economic
growth originating outside the sector. Increasing investment—and investing more wisely—is thus fundamental for economic growth, poverty
reduction, and environmental sustainability.

The recent crises have added momentum to the Bank's emerging renewal of financing for agriculture and agribusiness, as IEG reported in a
2010 evaluation of work in this sector. Noting that the crucial question
concerns what steps would further strengthen effectiveness, IEG highlighted three lessons for future work. First, an increase in productivity requires focused attention to the availability of improved crop production
techniques, water supply, and market access, among other things. Second,
agriculture-based economies warrant special attention. Third, the Bank is
uniquely positioned to exploit synergies between public and private programs. These lessons provide avenues for lasting impact.

Indeed, investment in agriculture and rural development remained a
high priority for the Bank this fiscal year. The Bank's Agriculture Action Plan
projects the support from the Bank Group to agriculture and related
sectors of $6.2 billion-$8.3 billion over fiscal 2010-12, an increase from
an average annual level of $4.1 billion over fiscal 2006-08.

As food prices in 2011 neared the record levels seen in 2008, the Bank
extended the Global Food Price Crisis Response Program through 2012.
This program has provided support to almost 40 million people in more
than 40 low-income countries since it was created in 2008.

To help address high and volatile food prices, the World Bank is working within the G-20 process on a number of initiatives, including the
Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP). The program was
launched in 2010 to fill the financing gaps in national and regional agriculture and food security strategies. The GAFSP Steering Committee is an
external decision-making body made up of an equal number of donor
and recipient representatives as voting members. To date, donors—
including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the governments of
Australia, Canada, Ireland, Korea, Spain, and the United States—have
pledged $975 million to the public sector window of GAFSP. Canada and
the United States also have pledged $75 million to the private sector window. Since June 2010 GAFSP has awarded $481 million for projects in
Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Haiti, Liberia, Mongolia, Nepal, Niger,
Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Tajikistan, and Togo.

Climate change disproportionately affects the rural poor. The World
Bank is supporting climate-smart land and water management to deliver
both adaptation and mitigation benefits. Other core areas of its agriculture
portfolio include sustainable fisheries, water for agriculture, innovation
systems, forestry, community-driven development, livestock development,
land tenure, responsible agro-investment, rural finance, and agriculture
risk management. (See http://worldbank.org/rural.)

INFRASTRUCTURE
Today an estimated 880 million people in the world live without safe water,
14 billion lack electricity, 2.5 billion lack sanitation, and more than 1 billion
lack access to telephone services. Total demand for infrastructure investment and maintenance from developing countries is estimated at more
than $900 billion a year, with the greatest needs in Africa and Asia.

 

 

The first of its kind in the world, the Ain Beni Mathar concentrated solar

World Bank financing for infrastructure reached $19.7 billion in fiscal
2011. At this level, infrastructure remained the core business of the Bank,
accounting for 46 percent of total Bank assistance. Support included
$8.6 billion for transportation, $5.8 billion for energy, $4.6 billion for water,
and $640 million for information and communication technologies. South
Asia was the largest recipient (30 percent), followed by East Asia and Pacific
(24 percent), Latin America and the Caribbean (15 percent), and Africa
(14 percent). The Bank also produced more than 159 analytical and advisory products, including an urban transport climate change strategy for
China, an energy-efficiency strategy for Egypt, and an energy sector policy
analysis for Nigeria.

The Bank supports governments in advancing the “green” agenda by
leveraging financing from new facilities, such as the Carbon Partnership
Facility, the Clean Technology Fund, and green bonds. This fiscal year the
Bank set a “green” record of commitments to renewable energy or energyefficiency projects. In transport, roads and highways remain the largest
subsector, and lending to railways increased significantly.

In response to evolving needs from client countries, the Bank launched
the preparation of an update to the Sustainable Infrastructure Action Plan.
It will propose to continue supporting the core business of infrastructure for access, with an enhanced focus on transformational infrastructure,
mobilization of private capital, and other sources of financing. This update
will serve as an umbrella document, tying together the range of sector
strategies produced by the various sectors with connections to infrastructure. (See http://worldbank.org/infrastructure.)

POSTCRISIS DIRECTIONS 13AFRICA

African countries south of the Sahara weathered the recent global economic crisis better than past crises, thanks in part to improved economic
policies. As a result, Africa is one of the fastest-growing developing regions
in the world. Output expanded by an estimated 4.7 percent in 2010, a
vigorous rebound from the 1.7 percent growth achieved in 2009. The recovery was strongest among exporters of metals, minerals, and oil, which
benefited from higher commodity prices. At an estimated 5.3 percent,
GDP grew even faster in fiscal 2011 and is projected to reach 5.5 percent in
2012. As a result of this accelerated growth and progress on social indicators, four countries—Cape Verde, Ethiopia, Ghana, and Malawi—will likely
achieve most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), if not by
2015, then soon thereafter.

Serious development challenges remain in Africa, where about half
of the population lives on $1.25 a day, governance is weak, and 645 out of
every 100,000 African women die in childbirth.

However, there are improvements. Maternal mortality declined by 26
percent between 1990 and 2009. Child mortality is also declining, the rate
of HIV infection is stabilizing, primary school completion rates are rising
faster than anywhere else in the world, and the percentage of people living in extreme poverty is falling. Foreign direct investment in 2010 exceeded that in India, with international capital inflows rising to 4.6 percent
of GDP, and remittances reaching about $11.5 billion. The business climate
has improved, with three countries in the region—Cape Verde, Rwanda,
and Zambia—among the 10 economies worldwide that most improved

the ease of doing business in 2010. The climate for market-oriented, propoor reforms is proving robust, and the voice of civil society is emerging
as a bulwark against the blight of “quiet corruption, in which public
servants fail to deliver services or inputs that have been paid for by the
government.

Africa's long-term growth will increasingly reflect interrelated social
and demographic changes creating new domestic engines of growth. Key
among these will be urbanization, an expanding labor force, and the rise of
the middle-class African consumer. In 1980 just 28 percent of Africans lived
in cities. Today 40 percent of the continent's 1 billion people do—a proportion roughly comparable to China's and larger than India’s. By 2030 this
share is projected to rise to 50 percent, and Africa's top 18 cities will have a
combined annual spending power of $1.3 trillion.

Renewing the Push for the MDGs
Many countries in Africa have made progress toward the MDGs. Tanzania is
on track to meet the targets related to infant and child health. Senegal has
made great strides in improving nutrition. Data from Niger indicate that
modern contraceptives are being used more widely than ever before.
Better results are a combination of many factors, including behavioral
changes, country ownership, education, equitable access to health services, payoffs from health system reforms, and improved donor coordination. Were these changes to be adopted more widely, Africa could reach
the maternal and child health MDGs within a few years of the 2015 target.

World Bank Assistance
The Bank delivered $7.1 billion to Africa in fiscal 2011. Support included
$7 billion from IDA and $56 million from IBRD.

In response to the opportunity for Africa to transform itself and improve
the lives of its people, the Bank has developed an ambitious 10-year strategy, Africa's Future and the World Bank's Support to It, which could help the
region's economies take off the way the economies of Asia did 30 years
ago. The new approach has two pillars—competitiveness and employment, and vulnerability and resilience—which rest on a foundation of
strengthened governance and public sector capacity. The strategy reverses
the order of importance of the Bank's instruments to support Africa, giving
prominence to partnerships, then knowledge, and finally finance. The goal
is to ensure that the Bank's interventions complement the interventions of
others, including African governments, the private sector, and civil society.

Focusing on Agriculture

In response to the global rise in food prices, the Bank scaled up targeted
lending for agriculture programs across the continent, providing $0.8
billion in support in fiscal 2011. The Bank's work is closely aligned with the
Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme, the Africaowned and -led initiative for increasing productivity in agriculture.

Building Human Capital in Africa

African countries have made massive improvements in increasing primary
school enrollment, enrolling millions of additional children over the past
decade. In line with its new education strategy, the Bank's focus is now
on achieving “learning for all’ The Bank is also working with countries
on higher education and skills development to improve sustainability and
align education and training with the needs of the job market.

Progress has also been significant in health. Ethiopia, The Gambia,
Malawi, and Rwanda reduced child mortality by at least 25 percent
over the past decade, with the rate in Rwanda falling 47 percent. Many
African countries have reduced maternal mortality by 20-50 percent.

With 22.5 million people in Africa living with HIV/AIDS and with malaria
and tuberculosis remaining major challenges, combating communicable
diseases is a priority. The Bank-supported East Africa Public Health Laboratory Networking Project is helping four countries coordinate their disease
surveillance. Bank financing of $1.4 billion to date for the fight against HIV/
AIDS in Africa has helped to catalyze global funding for HIV/AIDS, which
rose from $1.6 billion in 2001 to more than $16 billion in 2010. The Bank has
also been an active partner in Africa's efforts to control malaria. The Malaria
Booster Program has financed 51.7 million mosquito nets across the
booster portfolio, with an additional 21 million planned.

Strong examples of social protection are evident in the work performed
across the continent. In Ethiopia, for example, the World Bank committed
additional cash and food transfers for 10 million people during the global
economic crisis.

Thousands of Togolese have benefited from a World Bank-funded
Community Development Project. Launched in February 2009, the project
operates mainly in rural areas, and it supports the implementation of development priorities identified by grassroots communications, empower

ing the poor to take charge of their own development. Actions funded to
date include building classrooms and health centers, connecting agricultural villages to commercial centers, providing resources for incomegenerating activities, and improving food security.

Partnering for Regional Integration

Regional integration is critical to accelerating progress in Africa, where
most economies and markets are relatively small and isolated, and many
countries are landlocked. Regional lending in Africa reached $1.0 billion
in fiscal 2011, an increase of 66 percent since 2010. Interventions included support to the $300 million West Africa Regional Communications Infrastructure Program, which complements the Regional Infrastructure Connectivity and the Central African Backbone programs. (See

THE REGIONS 15EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC

Recovery from the global economic crisis is firmly on track in developing
East Asia, with real GDP growth, industrial production, and exports all surpassing precrisis levels. Output rose 9.6 percent in 2010 and is projected to
grow by about 8 percent in 2011 and 2012.

The region has the potential to secure its recovery and continue on its
path of rapid and sustained growth—f it is able to harness opportunities
and meet various challenges. Managing inflation was the key short-term
challenge in the region this year, which was complicated by a surge in
portfolio capital inflows and large increases in food and commodity prices.
Looking forward, East Asia and Pacific countries need to increase regional
integration to take advantage of a rapidly growing China. Reducing inequality and social exclusion, making cities in the region resilient to natural
disasters, and addressing the effects of climate change are also important
for continuous growth.

World Bank Assistance

The Bank approved $8.0 billion for East Asia and Pacific for 58 projects this
fiscal year. Support included $6.4 billion in IBRD loans and $1.6 billion in
IDA commitments. The regional strategy for this year is aligned with Bank
priorities, which focus on sustaining growth, effective poverty reduction,
country-based governance and anticorruption strategies, and regional

engagement on global issues (including preparations for crises such as
natural disasters and rising food and commodity prices). Resources were
leveraged through partnerships with the Asian Development Bank; regional organizations, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation; and donors, including Australia,
the European Union, and Japan.

Sharing Knowledge

As the region's development needs have become more sophisticated, the
knowledge agenda has grown in significance. Among the Bank's knowledge products, the March edition of the twice yearly “East Asia and Pacific
Economic Update” provided analysis of the impact of the earthquake
in Japan on the regional economy just days after the disaster. Regular
country economic reports were produced for China, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Mongolia, the Philippines, and Thailand. The Bank worked with partners
to publish Climate Risks and Adaptation in Asian Coastal Megacities this
fiscal year. A flagship study on higher education in East Asia to support
productivity and growth has been conducted. The Bank also hosted the
Conference on East Asian Development, bringing together senior policy
makers and development experts to discuss regional development challenges and opportunities to prepare for a more prosperous future.

Building Resilience to Natural Hazards and Climate Change
Increasing resilience to extreme climate events, rising sea levels, and other
natural hazards is a major medium-term challenge for the region, which
has experienced more than 70 percent of the world’s natural disasters
and sustained 82 percent of total disaster fatalities since 1997. The Bank's
work encompasses analytical and advisory services in disaster and climate
change risk assessments, the development of risk financing options, and
risk-mitigation policies. This year the tragedies of the floods and cyclone in
Australia, and the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, required mutual learning and understanding between the Bank and its donors.

Regarding risk mitigation, a policy note on “Preparing for Asia’s Next Big
Earthquake” was released in October 2010, leading to seismic retrofitting
in schools in Indonesia.

In postdisaster reconstruction an $11.8 million project in Samoa will
support the relocation and rehabilitation of communities on the island of
Upolu, affected by the 2009 earthquake, by providing new access roads
and rebuilding damaged roads and sea walls. A $3.5 million grant through
the Java Reconstruction Fund was mobilized to finance the reconstruction
of housing and community infrastructure destroyed by the 2010 eruption
of Mount Merapi through an existing community-driven development
program.

Supporting a Maturing Economy in China

China became the world’s second-largest economy in 2010, representing
about 9.5 percent of global GDP at market exchange rates. At these rates,
per capita GDP nonetheless remains below the world average. The Bank
committed to China around $1,7 billion for 14 projects this fiscal year, of
which three were carried over from the previous year. About 76 percent
of ongoing Bank-financed projects in China show a strong focus on the
environment.

The Bank's partnership with China now emphasizes economic analysis,
policy advice, technical assistance, and training. For example, the Bank is
working with China's Development Research Center of the State Council,
together with the Ministry of Finance, to prepare a joint report that develops a policy agenda for rapid and sustainable growth in order for the country to transition to a high-income economy.

Working with Middle- and Low-Income Countries in the Region
In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic the 1,070 megawatt Nam Theun
2 Hydroelectric Project was inaugurated in December 2010. The project
was supported by $1.3 billion in financing from 27 parties, including the
Bank. Revenue generated from the sale of electricity to Thailand has been
channeled into spending on education in poor districts ($2 million), rural
roads ($1.7 million), and public health ($1 million). The Bank is also working
with the government on a broader program to strengthen public financial
management.

In the Philippines a Bank-financed conditional cash transfer program
is serving as the backbone of a modern and consolidated social protection system. More than 1.6 million households are benefiting from the
program.

 

Vietnam has made substantial progress in adopting market-oriented
reforms, positioning it to achieve middle-income status after transitioning
from an IDA to an IBRD blend country in 2009. This year the Bank began
developing the next country partnership strategy with the Vietnamese
government covering 2011-16. The Bank approved a $330 million loan to
support the Trung Son Hydropower Project, which will help meet the
country’s rapidly increasing demand for electricity.

The Bank also enhanced its analytical and financial support to the
Pacific Islands. The first country assistance strategy for Kiribati places climate change adaptation at the center of a three-year plan that supports
the government's efforts to manage groundwater reserves, improve rainwater collection, and develop new sources of water. In Tonga the country
assistance strategy for 2011-14 focuses on economic reform as a way
to build resilience to food and fuel price shocks. (See http://worldbank

THE REGIONS 7EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA

Growth resumed in Europe and Central Asia in 2010 and reached 4.5 percent, following sharp declines during the global economic crisis. Projections
for 2011-13 are for a slightly stronger performance, but remain below those
for other regions.

Growth has been more tepid in Central and Southeastern Europe than
in the Commonwealth of Independent States, where high commodity
prices have raised net exports, increased remittance flows from migrants,
and boosted private consumption. For net importers, higher food and energy prices threaten to increase poverty, particularly in Armenia, the Kyrgyz
Republic, and Tajikistan. The region as a whole continues to be dependent
on Western Europe, which is struggling with a sovereign debt crisis.

World Bank Assistance

Bank support reached $6.1 billion this fiscal year, including $5.5 billion from
IBRD and $655 million from IDA. Turkey ($1.4 billion), Poland ($1.1 billion),
and Romania ($1.1 billion) were the largest borrowers. Sectors receiving
the most funding were Energy and Mining ($1.9 billion); Public Administration, Law, and Justice ($1.7 billion); and Health and Other Social Services
($1.2 billion).

Increasing Competitiveness

Countries in the region need to increase competitiveness, improve productivity, and strengthen regional integration. To help them do so, the
Bank supported regulatory reforms and public finance management in

These farmers in rural Kazakhstan are participating in the Bank-funded Agricultural
Competitiveness Project, which conducts agricultural research to apply innovative
techniques to apple cultivation. The Bank's mission in Kazakhstan is to support long-term
economic growth that translates into more jobs and better social services for all citizens.

Croatia and Poland; helped stabilize the financial sector in Serbia; and increased access to finance for small and medium enterprises in Armenia
and Turkey. It supported road improvements in Belarus, Kazakhstan, the
Kyrgyz Republic, and the South Caucasus, and public sector reforms to
improve governance and transport and energy delivery in Romania. The
Bank continues to work with client countries to identify their policy priorities, develop plans for recovery, improve the investment climate, and diversify exports, all with a view to creating jobs.

For the eighth year in a row, Europe and Central Asia led the world in
improving business regulation for domestic firms, according to Doing
Business 2011. Twenty-one countries in the region improved their rankings.

This fiscal year the Bank produced economic reports on the Russian
Federation, the European Union (EU)10, Kazakhstan, and Moldova. It also
produced studies of the informal economy in Turkey and growth and competitiveness in Poland. Its study of governance and the regulatory burden
in Eastern Europe and Central Asia was based on the fourth round of the
Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Surveys, which cover
more than 11,000 firms in 29 countries in the region.

Supporting Social Sector Reforms and Fiscal Adjustment

Social spending in certain Europe and Central Asia countries is inefficient.
Governments need to protect the poor by improving cash transfers, social
pensions, and targeted antipoverty programs. Bank financing to support
social sector reforms and strengthen safety nets included results-based

investment loans to Moldova and Romania, Rapid Social Response and
IDA grants to Tajikistan, additional financing for health and social protection in the Kyrgyz Republic, a health system improvement project in
Uzbekistan, and pension reforms in Romania and other countries in the
region.

The Bank is supporting improvements in government finances in more
than a dozen countries. This helped protect spending on social assistance
programs in Albania, Latvia, and Romania, as well as vital public services,
including education quality in Kazakhstan and Russia, and health care in
Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.

The Bank prepared several regional reports including a study of the
performance of pension systems and a study of household and government responses to the recession. It also released reports on social assistance programs in the western Balkans, female participation in the labor
market in Turkey, and long-term care policies for older populations in new
EU member states and Croatia.

Mitigating and Adapting to Climate Change

The lingering legacy of environmental mismanagement and energyintensive production in Europe and Central Asia has left the region ill
prepared to adapt to the negative impact of climate change. Many countries are suffering from unusually severe floods and droughts, and the
number of extreme events—droughts, floods, heat waves, windstorms,
and forest fires—is likely to increase in the coming decades.

The Bank is supporting efforts to mitigate carbon emissions, build
countries’ climate change knowledge base, and assess consequences and
adaptation approaches. It is financing energy efficiency projects in Belarus,
Poland, Turkey, and Ukraine, and development policy lending in Poland.
The Bank is working with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
Poland, Russia, and Ukraine on national energy efficiency strategies.

The Bank is strengthening the climate resilience aspect of its investment
portfolio. It continued its pilot projects on the vulnerability of energy systems, agriculture, and water. It also initiated projects on sustainable cities
and social development, and it expanded its knowledge and learning programs to a wider group of Bank staff and selected clients in the region.

Working with Partners
The Bank strengthened its partnership with the EU this fiscal year by cofinancing international reform packages, providing advisory services to
member states on EU issues and to potential candidate countries on accession issues, and expanding its work on regional energy issues. To enhance its engagement, the Bank produced a strategy for the region's partnership with the EU and other key Europe-based institutions (STEP-EU).
The Bank partnered with the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and the European Investment Bank for the Joint International Financial Institution Action Plan to support banking systems and
economies of Central and Eastern Europe in response to the economic
crisis. It worked with Russia as an emerging donor, partnering on the
food crisis response in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, a Rapid Social
Response to the food crisis in Tajikistan, and public finance management in the region. The Bank also partnered with the EurAsEc Anti-Crisis
fund to provide parallel financing for low-income countries in Europe and
Central Asia.

 

Strengthening Regional Integration and Cooperation

Given the high level of economic integration in the region, greater cooperation—on water and energy, transport, trade, corporate finance, and
social inclusion—is essential. The Bank supported the Southeastern
Europe Energy Community in establishing a common regulatory framework for energy markets and helped craft regional transport solutions to
meet EU transport requirements.

The Bank initiated a comprehensive Central Asia Energy-Water
Development Program to support Central Asian countries in managing
their water and energy resources, strengthening regional institutions, and
stimulating investments. A multidonor trust fund was established with
support from the U.K's Department for International Development and
the government of Switzerland, and discussions with other donors are
under way.

The Bank also worked with the European Commission on Roma inclusion and provided support through the Roma Education Fund and the
Decade of Roma Inclusion.

In Haiti Jeanne Bousiko is happy to know that she and her family can move back into her
house. The Bank-funded housing evaluation process has conducted 400,000 building
safety inspections since the January 12, 2010, earthquake.

LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN

Latin America and the Caribbean experienced one of the strongest periods
of growth in a century between 2002 and 2010, fueled by the longest and
most comprehensive commodity price boom in history and huge increases in exports to China. Growth quickly rebounded from the global
recession and reached 6 percent in 2010. As a result, more than 50 million
people were lifted out of moderate poverty between 2002 and 2008, and
for the first time, inroads were made to alter persistent economic inequality. Solid growth of 4-5 percent is projected for 2011.

The economic health of the region is a tribute to the reforms undertaken over the past two decades to achieve macroeconomic and financial stability while developing efficient social programs. Until 2002 Latin
America was a large global debtor. Today it is a significant creditor to the
rest of the world, and foreign capital flows into the region take the
form of equity rather than debt. By December 2010 annual gross capital
inflows for the largest countries in the region reached almost $330 billion,
an increase of almost $80 billion over the previous record, achieved in
March 2008.

World Bank Assistance

Bank support reached $9.6 billion this fiscal year, including $9.2 billion
from IBRD and $460 million from IDA. Support represented more than
20 percent of total Bank new commitments. Mexico ($2.8 billion) and Brazil

($2.5 billion) were among the largest borrowers. Health and Other Social
Services ($3.1 billion), Public Administration, Law, and Justice ($2.0 billion),
and Transportation ($1.1 billion) received the most funding.

Creating Opportunities for the Poor

The World Bank supports efforts to sustain the region’s economic recovery
while generating opportunities for all through programs that increase
productivity, create new good-quality jobs, and assist those most in need,
particularly through conditional cash transfers, which were pioneered in
the region. The Bank also maintains a focus on early childhood development. Since February 2010, when it helped launch the Early Childhood
Initiative: An Investment for Life, the Bank has provided half a million
young children in the region with adequate nutrition, health care, and
other support.

Mitigating and Adapting to Climate Change

Latin America and the Caribbean account for just 6 percent of global
greenhouse emissions. As a result of the dominance of hydroelectricity
over coal-fired plants, the region's power sector generates 40 percent less
carbon dioxide emissions per unit of energy than the world average.
Despite its own relatively low emissions, the region is a leader in efforts
to develop a comprehensive approach for mitigating and adapting to
climate change.

The Bank is providing increasing support to green programs in the region. In July 2010 it expanded its strategic partnership with Mexico, deepening its support of the country’s already extensive green programs.
Analytical work on low-carbon growth in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and
Uruguay has focused on the impacts of climate change on water resources
and agricultural productivity.

Responding to Natural Disasters

The Bank continued to assist Haiti in reconstruction activities in the aftermath of the massive earthquake in January 2010 that killed 230,000 people
and destroyed large parts of Port-au-Prince. Among other initiatives, the
Bank supported safety inspections of 400,000 buildings; provided grant financing for repair and reconstruction; and helped stabilize government
operations, fight the cholera epidemic, and get thousands of children back
to school.

In fiscal 2011, the Bank disbursed $116.1 million ($25 million from the
Haiti Reconstruction Fund), and provided Haiti with $78 million in new
grants. The Bank is also serving as the trustee for the multidonor Haiti
Reconstruction Fund, a partnership between the country’s government
and members of the international community. Debt forgiveness, remittances, and large aid inflows have allowed Haiti's central bank to build up
international reserves and stabilize its currency. As a result of national and
international efforts, the country’s economic contraction in 2010 was less
severe than expected, with GDP declining by 5.5 percent rather than the
8.5 percent that had been anticipated.

In response to the January 2011 mudslides in and around Rio de Janeiro
that left thousands of people homeless, the Bank approved a $485 million
housing project that will benefit 2 million poor people who lived in informal low-income settlements, or favelas, in the area (see page 7).

Promoting Inclusive Growth by

Going Local with Global Knowledge

At the request of central governments and direct beneficiaries, the Bank is
increasingly working with subnational governments. Through this innovative approach, the Bank refocuses assistance on providing customized
responses to the development needs of individual provinces.

In Argentina the Bank approved water and infrastructure projects that
promote sustainable economic development in the northern provinces,
Argentina's poorest region, where 72 percent of the 7.5 million residents
live in poverty. These projects will promote integration and foster the region’s competitiveness by increasing access to water and sanitation services and improving road infrastructure.

In July 2010 the Rio de Janeiro municipality received a $1 billion loan
for growth, education, and health—the largest Bank loan ever made to a
municipality. Approximately 70 percent of the loans made as part of the
last country partnership strategy are concentrated in Brazil's states and
municipalities. The Bank is also providing Rio de Janeiro with knowledge
and best practices in preparation for the 2016 summer Olympic Games.

 

Improving Citizen Security

Crime and violence are key development challenges throughout Latin
America and the Caribbean. As a percentage of GDP, the material costs
of crime are estimated to be nearly twice those of the United States. So
severe is the problem that in several Central American countries, the
annual number of violent deaths exceeds the number during the civil wars
of the 1980s. Since 1999 homicide rates have skyrocketed in El Salvador,
Guatemala, and Honduras, as criminal networks linked to drug trafficking
have become more active.

The Bank produced a comprehensive report, “Crime and Violence in
Central America: A Development Challenge,’ examining links in the subregion between crime, violence, and development. Launched in April
2011, the report presents a set of policy options for confronting the challenges of crime and violence, drawing lessons from country and regional
experiences. (See http://worldbank.org/lac.)

The recent events in many countries in the Middle East and North Africa
offer an opportunity for the people to carry out reforms to overhaul the
development paradigm. The Bank and its partners are developing a supportive framework based on the following pillars:

+ Governance—focusing on transparency of government, support to
civil society for social accountability, monitoring of service delivery,
improving corporate governance, and supporting the move from
market privilege to competition

Economic and social inclusion—evaluating social protection and subsidies, addressing lagging areas, and increasing economic and social
participation by women

Job creation—concentrating on short-term employment measures
and on educational quality and skills matching, labor market reforms,
and migration management

Economic growth acceleration—addressing growth, competition, and
the private sector, as well as regional and global integration, focusing
on new markets, infrastructure gaps, and environmental sustainability and climate change

These priorities are reflected in the new operation prepared in Tunisia,
and also in the programs and projects in development for other countries
in the region, foremost in the Arab Republic of Egypt. The events since
December 2010 have had an impact on growth—regional GDP growth fell
to 1.9 percent in fiscal 2009, rose to 4.4 percent in fiscal 2010, and, because
the situation remains in flux, fell further in fiscal 2011.

World Bank Assistance

Recent developments in some of the larger borrowing countries have led
to delays in program delivery in the last half of fiscal 2011. In Egypt, Tunisia,
and other countries, new programs and projects were initiated.

IBRD and IDA lending increased from $1.7 billion in fiscal 2009 to $3.7
billion in fiscal 2010 and fell to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2011. IDA support to the
Republic of Yemen in 2011, at $117 million, was significantly lower than the
§205 million provided in 2010. IDA support to Djibouti was $5.8 million in
2011 versus $8.9 million in fiscal 2010.

High-value, fee-based knowledge services increased from $12.2 million in fiscal 2010 to $14 million in fiscal 2011. The number of economic,
analytical, and advisory products independent of lending decreased from
120 in fiscal 2010 to 108 in fiscal 2011. The Bank also prepared a regional
poverty study; reports on regional development of the private sector and
on migration and integration; short notes on the impact and long-term
challenges stemming from the financial crisis, as well as current political
developments, especially as related to employment.

Exchanging [Searching for Solutions

In March 2011 the Bank organized the Arab Voices and Views conference—
live and webcast in Arabic and English, and accompanied by a simultaneous virtual chat and the launch of a new Middle East and North Africa
blog. The purpose was to open up an in-depth conversation about the
historic events in the region. Non-Bank panelists, widely recognized for

their innovative ideas, explored topics such as “The Use of New Media for
Social Accountability" and “Equity in Access to Jobs”

Building Partnerships

Collaboration with neighboring and national partners will help the region
realize results on a number of fronts. The Islamic Development Bank participated in the World Bank's Arab Financing Facility for Infrastructure, and
the African Development Bank supported the regional Concentrated Solar
Power initiative. The World Bank also worked in cooperation with the Arab
Monetary Fund in preparing the region's flagship report on the financial
sector. European nations are consulting on a range of issues focused
on creating economic opportunities. Japanese partners are helping to address youth issues in Egypt, Tunisia, and other countries.

Supporting Countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council

Increases in hydrocarbon prices boosted revenues of Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) countries. However, most GCC countries have sharply increased spending on subsidies and public sector wages in response to the
regional turmoil. Projections are that the fiscal impact of increased expenditures should be manageable as hydrocarbon prices rise.

The Bank's Reimbursable Technical Assistance program expanded in
fiscal 2011 as programs in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia grew and new programs began in Bahrain and Qatar. The Bank is working on macroeconomic
and fiscal capacity and labor markets in the United Arab Emirates, and its
program in Oman reflects a growing emphasis on education. In Qatar the
Bank is working on a portfolio to enhance macroeconomic and fiscal management capacity and on business and trade facilitation.

Supporting Other Oil Exporters
Algeria's non-oil-and-gas sectors and related revenues grew in fiscal 2011.
Largely fee based, World Bank support focused on economic diversification, assessment of public expenditures, social and economic policies, and
the narrowing of regional disparities.

The Bank's technical assistance program in the Syrian Arab Republic,
now suspended, had focused on economic growth and social protection.
Though the Republic of Yemen was granted $117 million in IDA funds, political upheaval has placed projects on hold, and disbursements face severe
delays.

Assisting Oil Importers
The Bank conducted significant analytical work on Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon,
Morocco, and Tunisia in fiscal 2011, particularly on economic governance
and social safety net issues. Bank technical assistance and financial support
to Egypt during the transition period are ongoing; projects in fiscal 2011
included a $200 million Second Integrated Sanitation and Irrigation Project,
$330 million in additional financing for the national railways restructuring
project, and a $100 million farm irrigation project.

In Lebanon two projects were approved in fiscal 2011: the $200 million
Greater Beirut Water Supply Project and the $40 million Second Education
Development Project.

 

 

Bank lending in Morocco included the urban transport development
policy loan (DPL) ($137 million), the agriculture (Maroc Vert) DPL ($205 million), and the solid waste DPL ($139 million). In May 2011 the Bank worked
with Morocco to commission 2,000 megawatts of solar power generation
capacity by 2020.

World Bank support for Tunisia in fiscal 2011 included a $500 million
multisectoral DPL with strong components on transparency and accountability. Also approved were a $50 million employment DPL and a $42 million Northwest Mountainous and Forested Areas investment loan.

Supporting the West Bank and Gaza

Strong economic management and significant donor support allowed the
West Bank economy to grow 7.6 percent in 2011, up from 7.0 percent in
2010. In Gaza the focus is on humanitarian support and the provision of
fundamental social services, as well as basic infrastructure services. (See

THE REGIONS 23SOUTH ASIA

Real GDP growth in South Asia accelerated to an estimated 8.7 percent in
2010, buoyed by strong growth in India, which accounts for 80 percent of
regional GDP. Growth was driven by vigorous domestic demand, macroeconomic policy stimulus measures, and a revival in investor and consumer
confidence. Robust increases in output of at least 6 percent a year over the
past 20 years have improved human development indicators in the region—but two-thirds of its 1.5 billion people still live on less than $2 a day.
As a result, increases in world food and fuel prices will disproportionately
affect South Asia, where about half of the average household's expenditures goes to food.

World Bank Assistance

The Bank is a key development partner in South Asia, with a portfolio of
210 projects and commitments of $38.1 billion. In fiscal 2011 it approved
46 projects in the region, $3.7 billion in IBRD loans, and $6.4 billion in IDA
commitments, including $397.3 million in grants.

Honing a New Regional Strategy

The Board approved an updated strategy for South Asia in fiscal 2011. This
strategy will consolidate stand-alone projects into sector projects and
focus on projects with the potential to transform the region. It will rely
on public-private partnerships for infrastructure; emphasize innovative,
results-based projects focused on the MDGs; and place greater emphasis

India’s Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan—the Education for All program—is one of the largest
efforts of its kind in the world. The Bank-supported, government-launched scheme
seeks to meet the primary education needs of nearly 200 million poor children living
in more than 1 million rural towns and villages across the country.

on leveraging resources through partnerships with other institutions, including the Asian Development Bank and bilateral donors. Gender equality,
climate change, regional integration, and governance will be emphasized.

Meeting Challenges in India
India is the Bank's largest borrower, with total commitments of $5.5
billion in fiscal 2011. One of the main challenges for India is the lack of
adequate infrastructure. To combat the problem, the government has
undertaken several large-scale programs covering various infrastructurerelated sectors. These include the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana—
the Prime Minister's Rural Roads Program—for which the Bank approved
a $1.5 billion loan in fiscal 2011. The project plans to increase connectivity in seven states (Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Meghalaya, Punjab,
Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, and Uttar Pradesh) over the next five years by
constructing 24,200 kilometers of all-weather roads. The project will benefit more than 6 million people. In addition a $350 million loan for the
Second Karnataka State Highway Improvement Project was approved this
fiscal year and will be used to expand 1,231 kilometers of roads to two
lanes. The project has already improved and maintained 2,385 kilometers
of roads, reducing travel time by more than 35 percent.

In May the World Bank approved a $1 billion credit and loan as part of
its long-term support for the government's Mission Clean Ganga, which
seeks to rejuvenate India's iconic river, along which more than 400 million

Indians live. The project will help set up dedicated institutions and finance
priority infrastructure for fighting pollution in the river.

The Bank also approved a $975 million loan to help Indian Railways
establish the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (a freight-only rail line),
which will provide faster and more efficient movement of raw materials
and finished goods between the densely populated northern and eastern
parts of India. The project is also expected to emit 2.25 times less carbon
emissions compared to an alternate scenario where freight is not carried
on a dedicated line.

Investing in Infrastructure

Infrastructure investment was also a top priority elsewhere in the region. In
Afghanistan the Bank added $40 million to the original $112 million grant
for the National Emergency Rural Access Project (NERAP). Launched in
2002 and supported through NERAP and its predecessor projects, the
government's Emergency Rural Access Program has rehabilitated some
10,370 kilometers of rural roads that connect 8,726 villages in 358 districts
of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, thereby reducing travel times and increasing
rural Afghans’ access to key services. The project has also rehabilitated
15,000 hectares of land by improving irrigation and drainage while providing employment opportunities to impoverished rural men, creating about
700,000 temporary jobs over a month while facilitating the reintegration
of ex-combatants into society. The additional grant to NERAP will provide
continued support of the government's ongoing efforts to provide yearround access to basic services and facilities in rural areas.

To improve connectivity and boost opportunities for people in southwestern Bangladesh, the World Bank approved a $1.2 billion IDA credit for
the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project in 2011. Spanning the Padma
River, the world’s third largest, the 6.1 kilometer bridge will connect nearly
30 million people in the southwest to the rest of the country, enhancing
their access to markets and services while accelerating growth in the
country as a whole.

Helping Pakistan Recover from Natural Disasters

Massive flooding in Pakistan in July and August 2010 killed 2,000 people
and left about one-fifth of the country under water, affecting more than
20 million people—more than one-tenth of the population. About 1.6
million homes were destroyed and thousands of acres of crops and
agricultural lands damaged, with major soil erosion occurring in some
areas. The Bank responded with an initial $300 million to finance the
purchase of critical imports, such as food, medicine, tents, construction
materials, machinery, and fuel, and an added $20 million was included
in the Third Additional Credit for the Highways Rehabilitation Project,
specifically for use in areas damaged by the floods. An additional $125
million in unconditional cash transfers to victims of the flood was also
approved this fiscal year. At the request of the government, the Asian
Development Bank and the World Bank jointly conducted a damage and
needs assessment, which estimates that $8.7 billion—$10.9 billion is needed
for recovery from and reconstruction associated with the floods.

 

Operating in Crisis and Postcrisis Areas
The 2009 military crisis in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administrated Tribal Areas led to one of the worst security crises in Pakistan's history,
displacing millions of people and severely disrupting lives, livelihoods, and
the provision of public services. In January 2010 the Bank's Board approved
the creation of a multidonor trust fund designed to restore infrastructure,
services, and livelihoods in the conflict-affected areas. The trust fund became operational in fiscal 2011, with 10 donors contributing $140 million.
Following the end of the armed conflict in 2010, Sri Lanka became a
middle-income country and is now eligible for IBRD lending. Access to the
commercial lending mechanism of the Bank allows Sri Lanka to more than
double the resources available to it every year. The government's development plan, Mahinda Chintana, aims to transform Sri Lanka into the“wonder
of Asia” by raising per capita incomes to more than $4,000 over the next six
years. To make this plan a reality, Sri Lanka is trying to position itself as a
strategically important economic center of the world, serving as a key link
between the East and the West. (See http://worldbank.org/sar.)

THE REGIONS 25THE WORLD BANK

DRIVEN BY RESULTS

The World Bank Group's mission is to lift and keep people out of poverty.
Through financial assistance, policy and institutional support, and technical knowledge, it helps people across the world build a better future for
themselves, their families, and their countries. At the heart of the Bank's
approach to delivering programs and policy advice is a strong focus on
results.

A Dynamic Framework for Capturing Results

The Bank has made significant advances in recent years in the ways it measures, monitors, and reports on results. Its commitment to results-based
assistance takes the following forms:

+ All Bank country assistance strategies are now results based, with results frameworks aligned with country priorities, allowing governments, donors, and stakeholders to collaborate more effectively to
identify and achieve common goals for development. In addition all
new sector strategies and regional development strategies now have
results frameworks with measurable indicators.

All Bank projects include results frameworks with measurable indicators, agreed upon with the country to guide implementation, allow
midcourse corrections to be made as needed, measure impact, and
cull lessons learned. Progress on results is disclosed at least once a
year—enabling all stakeholders to view each project's progress toward objectives and results in real time.

When a project is completed, staff and country counterparts prepare
an Implementation Completion and Results report to assess and
document the achievements and results supported by the operation.
Similarly, when Country Assistance/Partnership Strategies are completed, staff prepare a Completion Report.

All Bank-supported operations and strategies, when completed, are
also evaluated by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). This combination of self- and independent review provides an opportunity for
learning from the successes and failures of Bank operations. To ensure
that the lessons from evaluation inform new activities, the Bank
requires all new operations to highlight lessons learned, including
those from IEG evaluations. To promote learning, IEG and Bank Group
management together track implementation of IEG’s recommendations. In addition, the Bank has been expanding the use of impact
evaluations to broaden and deepen evidence on the effectiveness of
specific interventions and approaches in achieving results.

Core Sector Indicators

IDA is the first of the Bank Group's institutions to adopt a measurement
system to identify and track development results. The system combines
performance and results indicators using a four-tier approach: IDA Countries’ Progress, IDA-Supported Development Results, IDA Operational Effectiveness, and IDA Organizational Effectiveness.

The Bank has strengthened the way in which it measures results by introducing the collection and aggregation of standardized data from projects supported by IDA. Initially data were collected on four sectors. In fiscal
2011 the number of sectors was increased to seven: education; health;

26 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2011

 

roads; water supply; micro, small, and medium enterprises; urban development; and information and communication technology. This newly aggregated information supplements the more detailed project, country, and
sector results data previously available. Core sector indicators for additional
sectors and themes are under discussion and will include the IBRD portfolio as well.

Quantitative data (enhanced by the core sector indicators) are complemented by qualitative reviews at the country, sector, thematic, and project
levels. The reviews illustrate how IDA and IBRD are supporting government
development programs that make a difference—whether the effort is bolstering governance to reduce poverty in Bangladesh, boosting agricultural
competitiveness in Burkina Faso, equipping the judicial system to promote
justice in Ethiopia, or bringing clean water to communities in Rwanda.

A GLOBAL WORKFORCE
A true global community, the World Bank's staff comprises more than
10,000 people from 168 countries (beginning in fiscal 2011 World Bank

1 Central and South America
1 Europe

1) Middle East and North Africa
IB North America

BB Africa

§§) East Asia and Oceania

Central and South Asiastaffing figures include full-time staff on conditional appointments).
More than 38 percent of the Bank’s total staff work in the Bank's 124
country offices. The increased presence in the field helps the Bank better
understand, work more closely with, and provide faster service to its partners in client countries.

The institution's diverse workforce brings a wide range of perspectives
to bear on poverty reduction issues and emerging development challenges and is critical to the effectiveness of the Bank's core operational and
knowledge services. In its efforts to increase its responsiveness to clients
and to better integrate global and country knowledge, the Bank has continued to adapt its human resource policies and practices to facilitate the
global mobility of its staff. At the end of fiscal 2011, 91 percent of country
directors and country managers were based in the field.

As the Bank continues to focus on the world’s recovery from the financial crisis and on the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), it is also evolving to meet the emerging challenges of conflictaffected states. The Bank has established its on-the-ground presence in 26
of the 33 fragile and conflict-affected states that are transitioning to sustainable peace and economic growth, and more than 11 percent of the
Bank's operational staff have experience living and working in these challenging environments.

The World Bank continues to make progress on its five-year Diversity
and Inclusion Strategy, adopted in 2007. Nationals of developing countries
now account for 61 percent of all staff and hold 42 percent of managerial
positions. Women account for 51 percent of all staff and hold 36 percent of
managerial positions. Sub-Saharan African and Caribbean nationals represent 16 percent of all staff and hold 11 percent of managerial positions.
Among the Bank's 33 senior managers, 13 are women and 2 are SubSaharan African nationals.

MODERNIZING THE WORLD BANK
Since 2010 the World Bank has been engaged in a comprehensive modernization agenda based on four pillars:

+ Renewing and refining its strategic directions

+ Adopting 21st-century governance to give greater voice to members
from developing countries

+ Ensuring the institution's continued financial strength

+ Modernizing products and services, the organization, and processes
and systems.

These pillars will help make the Bank more efficient, results focused, responsive, and effective.

Strategic Priorities

As the global financial crisis began to ease, the Bank reexamined its role in
a rapidly changing world, balancing client demands against global and
regional priorities. It established five strategic priorities:

+ Target the poor and vulnerable. The Bank is focusing on countries that
are off track to reach the MDGs by 2015, particularly countries in
Africa. To help ensure access to basic health care, quality schooling,
clean water, energy, food, and jobs, it is working with countries to

 

Sedth

build social protection systems, enhance the gender focus of its programs and operations, and address the special needs of fragile and
conflict-affected situations.

Create opportunities for growth. Broad-based, sustainable growth ofers the most robust and durable path out of poverty. The Bank gives
priority to creating opportunities for growth, focusing on improving
the business climate, increasing competitiveness, addressing the inrastructure gap, promoting regional integration, and scaling up eforts to increase women’s participation in economic opportunities. It
as made substantial investments in infrastructure and agriculture,
which are important components of its support for growth.

Promote global collective action. The Bank is building the capacity to
elp provide and manage global public goods in order to build on,
reinforce, and coordinate national actions; channel funds to national
programs; and monitor and report on progress. The Bank is working
with a wide range of partners across a broad spectrum of global
issues, including financial inclusion, education, health, and climate
change, one of the special themes in the IDA16 replenishment.

 

Strengthen governance. The Bank continues to give high priority
to the governance and anticorruption agenda. An assessment of the
lessons of recent work includes: the importance of using country
systems; the need to identify and measure the effect of governance
on development results at the sector, country, and global levels;
the need for a more informed approach to risk management; and the
need for a more rigorous and systematic learning of lessons and
the management of knowledge. It is preparing for a second phase of
its governance and anticorruption work, which will include an analysis of how specific thematic areas (procurement, judicial reform, the
private sector, and public sector management) can more effectively

THE WORLD BANK 27contribute to overall objectives and how the Bank can serve as a
catalyst for strengthening good governance globally.

Manage risk and prepare for crises. To assist developing countries—
especially low-income countries—in better managing the risks of
closer integration in a global environment, the Bank is developing
new and innovative risk management mechanisms and instruments.
It responded to food price volatility by extending the Global Food
Price Crisis Response Program through June 2012. Since 2008 the
Bank and other institutions have fast-tracked $1.5 billion through this
program to benefit an estimated 38 million people in 44 countries,
most of them in Africa. Because low-income countries are especially
vulnerable to both financial crises and natural disasters, crisis response was made a special theme of IDA16. To enhance IDA's capacity to respond to crises, the Bank agreed to establish a dedicated crisis
response window in IDA in the amount of special drawing rights
(SDR) 1.3 billion, including an exceptional allocation of SDR 329 million for Haiti.

Governance

The Development Committee endorsed a package of voice and participation reforms in April 2010. In accordance with the first phase, countries in
Africa are now represented by three Executive Directors, elected last fall
when a third chair was added. The second phase of voice reforms, approved by the Board of Governors in March 2011, increased the voting
power of developing countries and transition economies in IBRD by 3.1
percentage points (a total shift of 4.6 percentage points since 2008) to

28 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2011

a total of 47.2 percent. Under the new reforms, the Bank is required to
review its shareholding every five years, starting in 2015.

Financial Capacity

Following changes to IBRD loan maturity terms in June 2010, the Bank
took several additional steps to ensure its continued financial strength. The
Board of Governors approved resolutions on IBRD general and selective
capital increases, and IBRD shareholders continued to work toward agreements on the release of national currency paid-in capital.

IDA16 negotiations were completed in 2010, with an agreement on a
historic high replenishment of $49.3 billion. This 18 percent increase over
the previous replenishment represents the efforts of a global coalition. The
increase will substantially enhance IDA’s ability to support low-income
countries and activities in gender, climate change, fragility and conflict,
and crisis response.

Business Modernization

An ambitious program of internal reforms aims to modernize business
processes to help the World Bank work more closely with clients, enhance
their financial services, and better gather and disseminate knowledge and
expertise. Reform priorities and actions fall into three main areas:

+ Modernize products and services, with a sharper focus on results.
The Bank is adopting a more risk-based approach to projects, shifting
its focus toward implementation support. It is designing a new lending instrument that disburses directly against results—the Programfor-Results—and is reviewing its knowledge services to better achieve
and measure impact.

Modernize the organization for increased integration, openness, and accountability. The Bank is experimenting with ways to make decentralization even more effective, and connecting knowledge services
globally to enhance technical excellence.

Modernize processes and systems for greater efficiency and flexibility. The
Bank is working to update its environmental and social safeguards
policies, and will conduct a complete review of its procurement policies. It is implementing information management technology solutions to better support lending operations, knowledge, global public
goods, and human resource processes and systems.

The Open Bank
These reforms are anchored in a new era of openness, which in the past
year saw the World Bank launch a revamped disclosure policy and open its
vast storehouse of data and visualization tools to the public. During this
period the Bank became an acknowledged transparency leader—as
ranked by the U.K.-based organization Publish What You Fund—as data
usage tripled and a new Mapping for Results application was launched
(see http://maps.worldbank.org), along with four iPhone “apps” and a
new tool for tracking aid flows (see http://worldbank.org/aidflows).
These changes go hand in hand with a new multilingual, multimedia
approach that actively engages audiences in live events and discussions,
seeking their questions and crowd-sourcing ideas and observationsthrough a range of interactive social media platforms: World Bank Live
(see http://live.worldbank.org), the Bank's Facebook channel (see http://
worldbank.org/facebook), blogs (see http://blogs.worldbank.org), and
Twitter (see http://twitter.com/worldbank).

World Bank Live is a window into key Bank events and offers webcasts
of panel discussions that are fully integrated with audience inputs via the
Bank’s website, Facebook, and Twitter. The channel encourages a two-way
dialogue with Bank experts on key development topics, and conversations
with real-time translation are available in 14 languages.

PROGRAM-FOR-RESULTS FINANCING

To respond to changing development needs and the demand from client
countries, and building on experience to date, the Bank proposed a new
lending instrument in fiscal 2011—Program-for-Results Financing. Under
Program-for-Results, Bank support would help member countries improve
the design and implementation of their own development programs.

While results are at the center of all that the Bank does, Program-forResults would place more direct emphasis on development results by linking disbursements to results or performance indicators. Program-forResults would work directly with the program's institutions and systems
and, when appropriate, seek to strengthen those institutions’ governance,
capacities, and systems over time. Program-for-Results would also be an
instrument for strengthening partnerships with governments as well as
relevant development partners and other stakeholders by allowing the
Bank to effectively support larger programs and cofinance in pooled funding arrangements.

Program-for-Results would provide member countries with a wider
range of instruments from which to choose. Development policy lending
will remain the primary Bank instrument to support policy actions to
achieve a country’s overall development objectives, with rapidly disbursing general budget support. Investment lending will remain the Bank's
main instrument to support projects, with disbursement against specific
transactions. Program-for-Results would be the instrument of choice when
the objective is to support the performance of a government program using the government's own systems; when the results require expenditures;
and when the risks to achieving the program's objectives relate to the governance and capacity of the systems to achieve better results.

The key features of Program-for-Results would be:

The proposed Program-for-Results lending instrument is expected to
be submitted for approval by the Bank's Board of Directors in fiscal 2012.

SHARING KNOWLEDGE

One of the Bank's core strategic assets is its knowledge output, as the
strategy endorsed by the Board in March 2009 recognized. To fully harness this asset, the Bank seeks to improve its ability to produce, customize,
and share knowledge to its clients through global technical practices;
make the vast amount of knowledge it produces more impact driven; and
strengthen its role as a global connector, linking country practitioners and
policy makers to sources and centers of knowledge and innovation dispersed across the world.

To make the knowledge strategy operational, the Bank created the
Knowledge and Learning Council, which is leading and overseeing the
new knowledge and learning strategies, and the Matrix Leadership Team,
which will make the Bank's organizational structure of regional and network departments more effective. It formed Global Expert Teams; established a social networking platform; created a top-level technical stream;
launched a Bank Fellows program; funded six Knowledge Platforms;
and piloted initiatives to support embedded knowledge, South-South
exchanges, and innovation.

The Knowledge and Learning Council began preparing the Knowledge
Report, an annual publication that will support the development of a Bankwide consensus on modernizing the Bank’s knowledge services, with the
aim of strengthening quality, relevance, results, and accountability. The
new report reflects the widespread recognition that the Bank needs to
become better at responding to demands by clients for timely knowledge
and needs to regularly measure how well it does. To meet client demand
for world-class knowledge, the Bank must bring to its knowledge products
the same rigor and clarity in the formulation of objectives and the identifi

cation of results that it requires of its lending products. It also needs to
develop options for financing knowledge services that allow the Bank to
serve all of its clients, including low- and middle-income countries, borrowers, and nonborrowers.

By fiscal 2013 implementation of frameworks for the Bank's analytical
and advisory services, research, and external training services will be
in full swing, with baseline and postdelivery data collected to measure
results using established intermediate outcome indicators. Building on
the “K-notes” database (developed by the Middle East and North Africa
region), which aggregates the various series of knowledge notes from
around the institution, data and analysis of knowledge services will be
channeled into a searchable Bank-wide database that staff can use to
inform policy dialogue and improve outcomes.

WORLD BANK INSTITUTE

During the past year, the World Bank Institute (WBI) focused on the implementation of an ambitious renewal strategy that directly supports the
World Bank Group's knowledge agenda. Through several high-profile initiatives, WBI was able to start playing the role of connector of knowledge
at the global level. At the same time, it leveraged its programs to pilot new
capacity development approaches and to provide tools to clients to enhance development initiatives at the local level.

Innovative Solutions in Support of Open Data

WEBI organized an Apps for Development competition to tap into the creativity of software engineers and encourage them to address development
problems using the Bank's publicly available data sets. As a result, more
than 100 apps—half of them from developing countries—were designed,
generating new tools for the research community and the general public.
In parallel WBI and partners introduced an exciting initiative, Mapping for

30 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2011

Results, that helps visualize World Bank-funded projects and plot them on
maps against various human development indicators (such as infant mortality and school enrollment). The World Bank's portfolios in all 79 IDA
countries have been mapped.

South-South Knowledge Exchange

WEBI has substantially stepped up its efforts to connect development practitioners with peers who have successfully tackled similar problems. These
efforts included a series of dialogues on dealing with the economic crisis,
as well as nurturing communities of practice around public-private partnerships, inclusive cities, governance in extractive industries, and other
areas. In addition, the WBI launched a South-South Knowledge Exchange
online platform that allows the World Bank to broker practitioner exchanges on a broad scale and in a systematic manner.

Investing in the “How To” of Reform

WEBI has invested in a series of nontechnical approaches that complement
technical solutions to development problems. The institute's programs on
leadership and coalition building, for instance, help clients to become
effective change agents and to navigate the political economy of reforms.
In East Africa WBI is working to modernize the procurement system of pharmaceuticals, often a black hole into which scarce health sector funds disappear because of mismanagement and corruption. WBI is bringing together
key counterparts in government, civil society, and the pharmaceutical
companies and supporting them to advance this sensitive reform.

Scaling Up the Delivery of Learning Programs

WBI has joined forces with leading learning institutions around the world
to significantly increase the number of thematic learning programs it offers to government counterparts and other development practitioners.
In addition, the e-Institute, a platform for the provision of online training,
is being established as the main mechanism to scale up the delivery of
learning programs.

DEMOCRATIZING DEVELOPMENT

The Development Economics Vice Presidency (DEC) conducts world-class
research, assesses development prospects (through global monitoring
and projections), and collects development data, including international
statistics and data on results monitoring. It seeks to accelerate poverty reduction and contribute to progress toward achieving the MDGs by providing countries with the knowledge they need to make more-informed
policy choices. Its knowledge is also used to inform the Bank's public advocacy initiatives at the global level. DEC's vision and strategy are consistent
with the Bank's “Post-Crisis Directions” paper and the new institution-wide
knowledge strategy, which focuses on modernizing knowledge services.
(See http://econ.worldbank.org.)

In April 2010 the Bank brought even more global economic and development data to the Web for the world to use. Visitors to http://data
-worldbank.org can easily find, download, manipulate, and use the data
compiled by the Bank—free of charge and without restrictions. Complementing its Open Data Initiative, the Bank in fiscal 2011 extended itsefforts to make its knowledge available globally by launching an initiative
called Open Data, Open Knowledge, Open Solutions. The new initiative
provides information on more than 2,000 financial, business, health, economic, and human development indicators.

DEC is also developing software tools for data analysis and economic
forecasts. One is the e-Atlas of Global Development (see http://data
-worldbank.org/atlas-global)—a free interactive tool that maps and
graphs more than 175 indicators from the Bank's development database.
Other tools include ADePT, a software platform for automated economic
analysis (see http://worldbank.org/adept); iSimulate, a platform for
running economic simulations online; PovcalNet (see http://iresearch
-worldbank.org/PovcalNet); PovMap; and Living Standards Measurement Studies (see http://worldbank.org/Isms).

DEC responded to the global financial crisis through its research, data,
and analyses. Work on disaster prevention and mitigation proved timely in
the wake of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Analysts also conducted
research relevant to food and fuel price spikes and to the rush of investors
into farmland. Outputs included quick updates on the global economy
and commodity prices; original research on the impacts of shocks and crises, including policy responses; a book on the Group of 20 and postcrisis
growth and development; and updated estimates of the number of people
who fell into poverty as a result of the food and financial crises.

DEC produced several high-profile reports this fiscal year, including
the flagship World Development Report 2011: Conflict, Security and
Development; Global Economic Prospects; Global Development Horizons;
World Development Indicators 2011; Global Development Finance; and the
Global Monitoring Report 2011: Improving the Odds of Achieving the MDGs.
A migration and remittances team produced a fact book, regular online
global remittances briefs, and a series of reports on African migration.

The Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) initiative, which evaluates
projects and programs in client countries, greatly expanded its work this
year. It collaborated with 300 agencies in 72 countries to improve the effectiveness of policies and programs and to strengthen country capacity for
real-time, evidence-based policy making. The initiative will play a key role in
implementing the Bank's commitment under IDA16 to increase the number of project impact evaluations. (See http://worldbank.org/dime.)

As part of its knowledge outreach and generation, DEC continued to
oversee a research support program. Its Annual Bank Conference on
Development Economics, held in Paris in April 2011, examined the theme
of broadening opportunities for development. (See http://worldbank
.org/abcde2011.)

INTEGRITY

As a public institution, the World Bank needs to ensure that development
resources reach their intended beneficiaries. Working with governments,
the private sector, civil society, and other international institutions, the
Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) contributes to the Bank's governance and
anticorruption efforts, helping to ensure that funds are not lost.

Established in 2001, INT is the independent arm of the Bank responsible
for investigating allegations of fraud and corruption in Bank-financed projects, as well as allegations of serious fraud and corruption involving staff.
By combining investigation with an enhanced focus on prevention and the
early detection of red flags in projects, INT promotes a proactive approach
to managing fraud and corruption risks across the Bank's operations.

INT has highly specialized international investigators assigned to each
of the six Bank regions. In addition INT has set up a preventive services unit
and a forensic accounting unit to support investigations and to offer advice on how to mitigate a project's vulnerability to fraud and corruption.
The units also provide training to project teams, implementing entities,
and other national institutions, and to representatives of the private sector,
including contractors and consultants.

This fiscal year INT completed 83 investigations and debarred 35
individuals and companies from doing business in any of its projects.
The Bank also cross-debarred entities under the terms of the CrossDebarment Agreement signed with other multilateral development banks
and launched by the World Bank in July 2010.

In September 2010 as part of its sanctions reform, the Bank adopted
debarment with conditional release as its default sanction, and INT established the Office of Integrity Compliance and posted the Bank's new
Integrity Compliance Guidelines. The guidelines incorporate internationally recognized integrity standards and principles, and set a benchmark
that all debarred firms need to reach before they may recommence work
on Bank-financed projects.

In June 2011 INT released its first global report on the roads sector,
based on lessons derived from its investigations and building on the experiences of a number of developed and developing countries. The report
highlights the most common fraud and corruption risks and best practices
in mitigating those risks as experienced by developed and developing
countries. This work focuses on addressing vulnerability of the roads sec

tor, which is critical to advancing poverty reduction and economic growth
efforts in poor countries. (See http://worldbank.org/integrity.)

GOVERNANCE AND ANTICORRUPTION
The Bank Group began implementing its Governance and Anticorruption
(GAC) Strategy in mid-2007. The strategy is guided by seven key principles:

+ Fight poverty by building capable and accountable states that create
opportunities for the poor.

Ensure that work is country driven.

Adapt implementation to individual country circumstances.

Remain engaged even in poorly governed countries so that the poor
are not penalized for their government's actions.

Engage with a broad array of stakeholders.

Strive to strengthen, not bypass, country systems.

+ Work with governments, donors, and other actors.

Since 2007 the GAC Council, made up of the Bank's senior management,
has met regularly to monitor progress on the implementation of the strategy. Phase | helped create tools and resources for mainstreaming the GAC
approach into country analysis and planning and into sector and project
operations. Eighteen countries, with help from incremental trust fund resources, have worked to mainstream governance approaches into country
programming. Several innovative programs were developed to improve

32 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2011

transparency and accountability in country-level work. Analyses of political
economy and governance constraints to development effectiveness have
been increasingly used to help design better and more feasible programs.

IEG completed its assessment of the implementation of aspects of GAC
Phase | in July 2011. The findings of the evaluation will feed into a second
phase of GAC, which is now under preparation. Phase II will focus on intensifying efforts to measure development results, shifting the focus from
individual transactions to building sustainable country-level systems and
institutions, and taking a more informed and nuanced approach to risk
and risk management.

The Bank advanced multiple reforms to promote its own inclusiveness,
innovation, efficiency, effectiveness, openness, and accountability this fiscal year; its efforts to improve its own governance won international recognition. In October 2010, Publish What You Fund, a UK-based coalition of
civil society organizations working on governance, aid effectiveness, and
access to information, rated the Bank the highest-performing institution
among 30 major donors. (See http://worldbank.org/governance.)

CIVIL SOCIETY
The World Bank Group continued to expand its relations with civil society
organizations (CSOs) throughout the world, through policy dialogue
meetings, formal consultations, programmatic collaboration, and grantfunding mechanisms. To discuss the resurgence of high food prices,
the Bank convened two food roundtables with dozens of civil society leaders from the United States, Europe, and developing countries. As a result
of the multiyear dialogue, CSOs actively participated in the delivery of
food and agricultural services in 16 of 40 countries that received assistance
from the Bank's Global Food Price Crisis Response Program. In addition
three CSO representatives joined the steering committee of the Global
Agriculture and Food Security Program

This fiscal year the Bank met with members of the civil society advisory
group on the Bank's health portfolio, with young Arab leaders on the
democratic movements in the Middle East, and with high-level representatives of the International Trade Union Confederation. It also conducted
a series of formal consultations with CSOs on the Bank Group's strategies
for the environment, education, performance standards, and trade. The
most extensive of these meetings was on the first phase of the Bank's
energy policy, which involved Internet-based consultations and meetings
with more than 2,000 people in 31 countries. The Bank also provided
grants to thousands of CSOs worldwide through dozens of grant mechanisms and community-driven development funds. CSOs were involved in
the preparation of 81 percent of all new Bank-financed projects during
fiscal 2011.In AFGHANISTAN, there has been a

The core business of the World Bank is overcoming poverty and boosting economic growth in developing countries.

The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) lends to governments of middle-income and creditworthy low-income countries. This affiliate promotes
sustainable development through loans, guarantees, risk-management products, and nonlending analytical and advisory services. IBRD's financial strength enables it to borrow in
capital markets at low cost and to offer clients favorable borrowing terms.

| IBRD 32613R6
ee World Bank region boundaries SEPTEMBER 2010MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP
AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

 

| am pleased to introduce the 2010 Annual
Report and the new Web site (www.worldbank
.org/annualreport/2010) that expands on the
Report. Together they capture today’s stark realities, our innovative reforms, and financial and
field results. They illustrate the course we are
charting to create a New World Bank for a New
World.

New World, New World Bank defines our vision for an institution that serves the emerging
multipolar global economy. The World Bank
Group's transformation can bring about a modernized multilateralism that treats developing
countries as key actors.

Although we hope the worst of the economic crisis is over, we face
a period of high uncertainty with a slow and uneven recovery and its
attendant inevitable setbacks. Developing countries have been increasingly providing the demand that is pulling the global economy
out of the crisis. Developing-world imports have accounted for more
than half of the increase in world import demand since 2000. Developing countries are importers of capital goods and services. Billions of
people in developing countries are joining the world economy as their
incomes and living standards rise. The developing world’s share of
global gross domestic product in purchasing power parity terms has
increased from 33.7 percent in 1980 to 43.4 percent in 2010. Prospects
for growth for developing countries are good and are projected to
exceed the recovery for higher-income countries.

At the Spring Meetings in April 2010, the World Bank Group's shareholders endorsed the World Bank's first major capital increase—$86
billion—in more than 20 years. The additional funding will help create
jobs and invest in infrastructure, small and medium enterprises, safety
nets, and more.

Our shareholders also fulfilled the commitment made at the
Annual Meetings in Istanbul last October to increase voting power
at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
for developing and transition countries by at least 3 percentage points,
bringing them to 47.19 percent—a total shift of 4.59 percent since
2008. Developing-country voting power in the International Development Association (IDA) will rise to more than 45 percent. Developing

 

 

and transition countries’ shares at the International Finance Corporation (IFC) will increase
by 6.07 percent to 39.48 percent. These changes
in voting power help us better reflect the realities
of the new multipolar global economy, where
developing and transition countries are now key
players

IFC will further boost its capital through
issuance of a hybrid bond and through retained
earnings.

The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA) is changing its procedures and is modifying its convention to be more flexible and to expand its range of services.

Our shareholders also endorsed our internal reform agenda and
post-crisis strategy. Through the strategy, we are sharpening our focus
where we can add more value: targeting the poor and vulnerable, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa; creating opportunities for growth with
a special emphasis on agriculture and infrastructure; promoting global
collective action on issues from climate change and trade to agriculture, food security, energy, water, and health; strengthening governance and anticorruption efforts; and preparing for crises.

These are all very important steps. Each part of the package approved is significant. Together they represent a dynamic transformation of the World Bank Group.

Moreover, the Bank Group is adopting a range of operational reforms
that enhance our effectiveness, accountability, transparency, and ability
to efficiently deliver financial and technical resources to our clients.

Our investment lending reform will improve our focus on results,
increase speed and delivery, and strengthen risk management. To
meet the shifting circumstances of our member countries, the Bank
is developing more customized investment-lending solutions. That
means making finance investment easier and moving from supervision of to implementation support for our clients.

On July 1, 2010, our new Access to Information Policy took effect,
making the World Bank the leader among multilateral institutions on
information disclosure. In April we launched the Open Data Initiative,
which places the World Bank at the forefront of providing free and easy
access to information and data on developing countries.

 

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2010 1We are continuing to move forward with strengthened governance
and anticorruption efforts that will provide more resources for prevention and coordinated sanctions to fight corruption. In May we signed a
pathbreaking agreement on cross-debarment with the other multilateral development banks.

During fiscal 2010 the Bank Group committed a record $72.9 billion
in loans, grants, equity investments, and guarantees to its members
and to private businesses in member countries, a 24 percent increase
over fiscal 2009.

IBRD commitments in fiscal 2010 totaled $44.2 billion, up from
$32.9 billion in 2009. IDA commitments rose to $14.5 billion, a 3.6 percent increase over last year. Support from IFC for its own account increased 14.3 percent to $12.7 billion, while MIGA issued $1.5 billion in
guarantees, up from $1.4 billion in fiscal 2009.

 

During the global crisis, these investments helped our clients finance targeted safety nets, infrastructure to boost productivity and
create jobs, and promote the private sector.

| particularly want to thank the staff of the World Bank Group in
Washington and in our more than 150 offices around the world. Their
hard work, dedication, and determination are allowing us to turn our
vision of a New World Bank for a New World into reality. | also want to
thank our Board of Governors and Board of Directors for their support
and guidance.

2 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2010THE BOARD OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

 

The challenging economic, financial, and development conditions in
2009 and early 2010, and their adverse effects on the fight against poverty, dominated the fiscal 2010 work program of the Executive Directors.
The Executive Directors took steps to position the World Bank Group to
confront existing and emerging global challenges by refining the institution's strategic priorities and modernizing its governance structure, as
well as approving record levels of lending. Directors discussed postcrisis
strategic directions for the Bank, including priorities that will shape the
World Bank Group's efforts to address development challenges and enhance its efforts to overcome poverty. They also discussed the need for
global coordinated actions by multilateral institutions and the key role
the Bank must play in fostering a new multilateralism. Directors discussed
actions to transform the World Bank Group through improvements in
governance, accountability, and operational effectiveness as well as to
improve shareholder representation and to increase capital. The Directors
agreed to increase the voting power of developing and transitional countries (DTCs) in IBRD by 3.13 percent, bringing it to 47.19 percent; the increase represents a total shift of 4.59 percent to DTCs since 2008. This realignment will be carried out through a selective capital increase of $27.8
billion with paid-in capital of $1.6 billion. In addition the Directors agreed
to an IBRD general capital increase of $58.4 billion, of which 6 percent,
or $3.5 billion, in paid-in capital will enhance IBRD’s financial capacity.
Directors also emphasized the importance of the inclusive nature of the
general capital increase and an ongoing commitment to IDA by enhanc
 

ing the value of IDA transfers, in line with IBRD’s financial capacity. Directors
expressed support for a successful IDA16 replenishment through fairer
and wider burden sharing.

To enhance the World Bank Group's operational capacity, efficiency,
and effectiveness, the Executive Directors reviewed the Bank's internal
reform initiatives, which included modernizing financial instruments and
knowledge services and reforming the service delivery model, human
resources, information management and technology, and budget processes. As part of the initiative toward making IBRD and IDA more agile
and responsive to client country needs, Directors discussed strengthening the organizational model, including options to make the Bank more
global and a review of the matrix management structure. The dialogue
will continue in the coming fiscal year.

Executive Directors approved a pilot IDA Crisis Response Window of
$1.5 billion, including voluntary donor contributions, to help IDA countries hard hit by the economic crisis through declining external trade,
remittances, and foreign direct investment.

The Executive Directors also approved a more open public information
policy that creates a major shift from a policy that spelled out what the
Bank may disclose to one that presumes the Bank will disclose any information in its possession that is not on a well-defined list of exceptions.

The Executive Directors approved lending of $44.2 billion for IBRD and
$14.5 billion for IDA. The Directors also considered 41 country assistance
strategy (CAS) products, of which 33 were prepared together with IFC. Of

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2010 3these, several CAS products were also prepared collaboratively with development partners and donors. Directors also reviewed the fourth retrospective review of CASs and discussed the future direction and strategic
contribution of CASs in steering the development process in a direction
that is results based and focused on country-specific development needs.

Executive Directors reviewed 12 Joint Staff Advisory Notes (SANs) on
country-owned Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs). PRSPs lay out
a country’s own poverty reduction strategy and specify the policies, programs, and resources needed to achieve development and poverty reduction goals. The PRSP process aims at fostering an open and inclusive
national dialogue among stakeholders to ensure effective participation
and ownership of the strategy.

Executive Directors approved an administrative budget for fiscal 2010
of $2,245.7 million net of reimbursements, including $171.2 million for the
Development Grant Facility, Institutional Grant Programs, and State and
Peace Building Fund, which represented a 1.39 percent nominal increase
in the net administrative budget over fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2011 the Executive Directors approved a total administrative budget, net of reimbursements, of $2,300.2 million.

The Inspection Panel reports to the Board. Its primary purpose is to
address the concerns of people who may be negatively affected by Bank
projects and to ensure adherence to operational policies and procedures
during design, preparation, and implementation phases of projects. In
fiscal 2010 the Inspection Panel received requests for inspection involving
nine Bank projects, of which eight requests were registered. The panel
recommended to the Executive Directors investigations in four cases. (See
www.inspectionpanel.org.)

The Role of the Board of Executive Directors

As provided in the Articles of Agreement, the Executive Directors are responsible for the conduct of the Bank’s general operations; they perform
their duties under powers delegated by the Board of Governors. Five of

 

the 24 Executive Directors (a 25th chair, to be held by Africa, will be added
in November 2010) are appointed by the five single members having the
largest number of shares; the rest are elected by the other member countries, which form constituencies in an election process conducted every
two years. The Executive Directors fulfill an important role in shaping policies that guide the general operations of the Bank and its strategic
direction, and they decide on IBRD loan and guarantee proposals and
on IDA credit, grant, and guarantee proposals made by the President.
The Directors are responsible for presenting to the Board of Governors
at the Annual Meetings audited accounts, an administrative budget,
and the Annual Report on Bank operations and policies, as well as any
other matters that, in their judgment, require submission to the Board
of Governors.

The Board is served by five standing committees composed of eight
Directors each: Audit, Budget, Development Effectiveness, Governance
and Administrative Matters, and Human Resources. These committees assist the Board in overseeing and making decisions about the World Bank
Group's policies and procedures, financial condition, risk-management
and assessment processes, adequacy of governance and controls, and
effectiveness of development and poverty reduction activities. In addition, a Board Ethics Committee provides guidance on matters covered by
the Code of Conduct for Board Officials.

The Board also monitors the effectiveness of the World Bank Group's
activities through the independent Inspection Panel and Independent
Evaluation Group—which report directly to the Board—as well as through
the Internal Audit Department and the external auditor.

The Corporate Secretariat Vice Presidency serves as the key interlocutor among the Board of Governors, the Executive Directors, and management and staff. This function includes managing the Board work program
on behalf of the Executive Directors and Senior Management and ensuring good governance practices in the conduct of the Board business
process. (See http://www.worldbank.org/boards.)

 

4 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2010IBRD ROLE AND RESOURCES

The Role of IBRD

IBRD is a shareholder cooperative owned by 187 countries. It operates a
financial services business that provides its members with loans and riskmanagement products. It also provides expertise in the full range of
development- and environment-related disciplines and serves the international community by coordinating responses to regional and global
policy challenges. (See http://www.worldbank.org/IBRD for development policy-based lending commitments.)

IBRD Financial Commitments and Services

New lending commitments by IBRD increased significantly in fiscal 2010,
to $44.2 billion for 164 operations, exceeding the historic high levels of
commitmentin fiscal 2009 ($32.9 billion). Latin America and the Caribbean
received the greatest share of IBRD’s new lending, with $13.7 billion, followed by Europe and Central Asia, with $10.2 billion, and South Asia, with
$6.7 billion. Among sectors, Energy and Mining received the highest
share of commitments (20 percent), followed by the Finance sector (19
percent) and the Public Administration, Law, and Justice sector (18 percent). The themes receiving the largest commitments were Financial and
Private Sector Development ($15.6 billion), Human Development ($5.6
billion), and Public Sector Governance ($4.6 billion).

IBRD also offers products that allow clients to manage risks related to
currency, interest rates, commodity prices, and natural disasters. In fiscal
2010 it executed U.S. dollar equivalents (USDeq) 11.8 billion in hedging
transactions on behalf of clients, including USDeq 11.7 billion in interest
rate hedges and USDeq 69 million in currency hedges (all local currency
conversions). In addition, the Bank's Treasury unit executed USDeq 477
million for the International Finance Facility for Immunisation and USDeq
541 million for IDA.

IBRD Resources
IBRD obtains most of its funds by issuing bonds on international capital
markets. In fiscal 2010 it raised USDeq 34 billion by issuing debt in 28

currencies at medium- to long-term maturities. Despite difficult market
conditions, IBRD was able to borrow these large volumes on very favorable
terms because of its standing in the capital markets and its financial
strength. That strength is based on IBRD's prudent financial policies and
practices, which help maintain its triple-A credit rating. As a cooperative
institution, IBRD seeks not to maximize profit but to earn enough income
to ensure its financial strength and sustain its development activities.

IBRD's allocable income rose to $764 million in fiscal 2010, up from
$500 million in fiscal 2009. The higher allocable income primarily reflected
a lower provision charge for losses on loans, guarantees, and deferred
drawdown options. The equity duration extension program implemented
in late fiscal 2008 substantially reduced the adverse impact of the signifcant downswing in market interest rates.

In August 2010 the Executive Directors recommended that the Board
of Governors approve transfers of $281 million to the general reserve,
§383 million to IDA, and $100 million to the surplus account from fiscal
2010 allocable income. As of June 30, 2010, IBRD held $36.1 billion in liquid
assets. Outstanding borrowings from capital markets were about $119.8
billion (net of swaps). Total disbursed and outstanding loans were $120.1
billion.

Consistent with IBRD's development mandate, the principal risk it takes
is the country credit risk inherent in its portfolio of loans and guarantees.
Risks related to interest and exchange rates are minimized.

One summary measure of the Bank's risk profile is the equity-to-loans
ratio, which is closely managed in line with the Bank’s financial and risk
outlook. This ratio stood at 29.4 percent as of June 30, 2010. To ensure that
IBRD has adequate capital to provide assistance following the record crisis
response that started in mid-2008, the Development Committee endorsed
and the Board of Executive Directors approved a package of measures, including a $86.2 billion general and selective capital increase, with $5.1 billion in paid-in capital.

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2010 5IDA ROLE AND RESOURCES

The Role of IDA

IDA is the largest multilateral channel of concessional financing to the
world’s poorest countries. Its funding supports countries’ efforts to boost
economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve the living conditions of
the poor. This fiscal year, 79 countries were eligible to receive IDA assistance. (See http://www.worldbank.org/IDA.)

IDA Financial Commitments
IDA commitments reached $14.5 billion in fiscal 2010. This funding included $11.9 billion in credits and $2.7 billion in grants. The largest share of
IDA resources was committed to Africa, which received $7.2 billion, or 49
percent of total IDA commitments. South Asia ($4.6 billion) and East Asia
($1.7 billion) also received large shares of committed funding. India and
Vietnam were the largest country recipients.

Commitments for infrastructure rose to $5.3 billion this fiscal year, a
9 percent increase over fiscal 2009. Significant support was also committed to the Public Administration, Law, and Justice ($2.7 billion) and the
Health and Social Services ($2.1 billion) sectors. The themes receiving the
largest commitments were the Human Development theme ($2.9 billion),
the Rural Development theme ($2.6 billion), and the Financial and Private
Sector Development theme ($2.1 billion).

IDA Resources

IDA is financed largely by contributions from donor governments. Additional financing comes from transfers from IBRD’s net income, grants from
IFC, and borrowers’ repayment of earlier IDA credits.

Every three years, donor governments and representatives of borrower
countries meet to discuss IDA’s policies and priorities and to agree on
e volume of new resources required to fund its lending program over
e subsequent three fiscal years. Under the 15th Replenishment (IDA15),
which covers fiscal 2009-1 1, total resources are $43.6 billion, of which new
donor contributions are $25.7 billion and donor MDRI compensation is
$4.9 billion.

The Mid-Term Review for IDA15 was initiated in November 2009. In addition to reviewing the broad progress in the implementation of IDA15,
Deputies endorsed the creation of a pilot Crisis Response Window (CRW),
approved by the Board in December 2009. To help mitigate the effects
of the financial crisis, this mechanism allocated about $1.5 billion, including voluntary donor contributions, in redeployed Bank funds to 56 nonoil-exporting IDA countries for the remainder of IDA15.

Negotiations over the 16th Replenishment (IDA16), which determine
the volume of resources required to fund IDA between 2012 and 2014,
take place during four meetings held between March and December 2010.
These meetings provide donors with a key opportunity to guide IDA allocations by themes and conditions on their commitments. IDA deputies
have already agreed on several themes for IDA16, including climate
change, gender, fragile states, and aid effectiveness. Next year, before
IDA16 takes effect on July 1, 2011, IDA will identify a set of monitorable
actions against which performance will be measured.

=GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS
At the outset of the financial and
economic crisis, many observers
believed that the developing
world would be resilient to the
turbulence in advanced countries. However, the financial condition of many developing countries deteriorated sharply as the
world economy shrank in 2009.
As a result of the crisis, some
64 million more people in the
developing world are expected
to fall into extreme poverty (defined as living on less than $1.25
a day) by the end of 2010, relative to the precrisis trend. Some
regions will be affected much
more than others. The recession
has been severe in Europe and
Central Asia, and Africa has been
hard hit. In contrast, growth re
shanties in a ghetto.

 

During a sudden downpour, a father and child dash down a street of

volatility. The work done in earlier
years to expand the Bank’s menu of
financial solutions to include products and services that help reduce
vulnerability to these risks stood
the Bank in good stead in the midst
of increased volatility. The volume
of its risk-management  transactions increased more than threefold
this fiscal year, compared with precrisis levels, as clients sought to
implement risk-management strategies. In addition, the Bank provided advisory services to help
governments develop and implement sound debt-management
strategies. The World Bank Group
also continued to forge partnerships with a broad coalition of institutions in response to the crisis.

mains relatively strong in the

East Asia and Pacific region; the South Asia and the Middle East and North
Africa regions escaped the worst effects of the crisis; and stronger fundamentals helped the Latin America and the Caribbean region weather this
crisis much better than past ones.

Just as the most acute phase of the global financial crisis has passed, the
debt crisis in some European countries is slowing recovery prospects. The
world economy—which contracted 2.1 percent in 2009—is growing, but as
the impact of stimulus packages wanes, growth is projected to reach just
3.3 percent in 2010. World trade volumes are projected to grow 11.2 percent
in 2010 and 6.8 percent in 2011—a strong rebound after the staggering
11.6 percent drop in 2009—and economic growth in developing countries
is projected to reach 6.2 percent in 2010 and 6.0 percent in 2011, up from
just 1.7 percent in 2009. These positive trends notwithstanding, it will be
years before jobs are restored and industrial capacity fully reabsorbed.

Against a backdrop of rising need and scarce resources, the Bank remained steadfast in its commitment to helping countries stabilize their
economies and preserve and enhance the foundations for longer-term
economic growth. It played an important role in channeling resources to
developing countries when capital flows plummeted. As in fiscal 2009, it
was among the few institutions that substantially increased lending, providing record financing of $58.7 billion in fiscal 2010. Bank initiatives—
which were tailored to macroeconomic circumstances, financial pressures,
and other challenges in specific countries—helped to create jobs, ensure
the delivery of essential services and infrastructure, set up safety net programs for the vulnerable, and restore confidence in financial markets.

In addition to increasing its lending, the Bank sought to mitigate the
impact of the global crisis on the world’s poor by helping governments to
manage the risks on their balance sheets and to address financial market

NEW WORLD, NEW WORLD BANK

The World Bank has played a significant role during the global financial and
economic crisis, pulling poor people out of poverty and keeping those
who are not poor from becoming so. Bank initiatives have provided special
vehicles for trade finance, microfinance, capitalization, and distressed debt;
established a pilot IDA Crisis Response Window to mitigate the effects of
the crisis; combined development and climate change policies to combat
global warming; and integrated governance and security for fragile states
emerging from conflict. The worst of the crisis seems to be over, but the
world economy faces an uncertain and uneven recovery, with new risks
to economic growth, human development, and poverty reduction. (See
http://www.worldbank.org/worldbankreform.)

Setting Postcrisis Priorities

The Bank is concentrating on five postcrisis priorities: targeting the poor
and vulnerable, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa; creating opportunities for
economic growth; promoting collective global action; strengthening governance; and preparing for future crises. By tailoring these strategic priorities to the needs of key client groups—low-income and least developed
countries, fragile and conflict-affected states, middle-income countries,
and the Arab World—the Bank seeks to target support where and when it
is needed most.

Increasing the Voting Power of Developing Countries and
Transition Economies

In 2008 in the first phase of reforms, it was agreed across the World Bank
Group to increase the voice and participation of developing countries and
transition economies. The Board of Governors agreed to increase these

 

10 WORLD BANK WORK IN A VOLATILE CLIMATEcountries’ voting shares in IBRD to
44 percent and created a third
chair on the Board of Executive
Directors for Africa. Developingcountry voting power in IDA increased to more than 45 percent
since the start of the Voice Reform
in 2008.

Building on these successes in
spring 2010, the World Bank Group
shareholders agreed on a second
phase of reforms that resulted in an
additional increase of 3.13 percent
in voting power for developing
and transition countries (DTCs),
bringing their total IBRD voting
power to 47.19 percent. Voice reform at IFC resulted in bringing
DTC voting power there to 39.48
percent, an increase of 6.07 percent. Regular IBRD and IFC shareholding reviews will take place
every five years as the Bank moves

These reforms target the Bank's financial services, human resource
structure, information technology
capacity, and budget allocations.
The reforms put a premium on extending the Bank's global reach and
responsiveness to diverse country
needs, supporting flexible responses to specific circumstances,
changing environments and different client segments, and augmenting effectiveness in combining and
deploying assets. Clients can expect
tosee a coordinated and integrated
response across regions, with an
emphasis on aid effectiveness, built
on a strong country platform of
donor coordination.

To improve the delivery of services, reforms will rely on new approaches to decentralization and a
revitalized matrix structure that will
bring a critical mass of knowledge

toward equitable voting power
between developed and developing countries over time.

Enhancing IBRD’s Financial Capacity

IBRD's strong capital position before the crisis enabled it to provide massive support when its clients needed it most. This record level of assistance
leaves the institution with little capacity to play the same role should the
recovery falter.

To address this potential problem, management and shareholders have
worked together and taken a number of measures to enhance IBRD’s financial capacity. The package of measures includes a total capital increase
of $86.2 billion, including $5.1 billion in paid-in capital; higher pricing; reform of loan maturity terms; continued budget discipline; and working
with relevant member countries to convert existing but not fully usable
capital into fully usable risk capital.

Member countries expressed their support of the capital increase package at the Spring Meetings (April 2010), including a $584 billion general
capital increase, with $3.5 billion in paid-in capital, and a $27.8 billion selective capital increase associated with the voice and participation reform,
which contains $1.6 billion in paid-in capital. The process is under way to
seek formal Board of Governors approval of the capital increases.

Instituting Internal Reforms

The Bank instituted a comprehensive reform agenda this fiscal year to support the modernization of its services and to improve their delivery. Underlying these internal reforms is the commitment to enhance transparency and
governance and to strengthen accountability and the results orientation.

 

and operational experience closer

to its clients and partners in lowincome countries and fragile states. Heretofore, the Bank's model did not
place global knowledge at the fingertips of clients, left many fragile states
underserved, and was becoming prohibitively expensive.

The Bank has also begun to review its regional and network matrices,
which provide a core organizational structure for the delivery of investment and knowledge services. Reforms aim to improve client services
through increased staff rotations across regions, tighter governance and
accountability for network vice presidencies, and the mobilization of top
talent for country offices.

Underpinning all modernizing, structural, and supportive reforms are
the Bank's ongoing efforts to increase transparency and improve governance in both client countries and the Bank itself. The Governance and AntiCorruption Initiative (GAC) continues to build client capacity for governance
and strengthen the integrity of Bank operations. In an effort to enhance
transparency, the Board approved a major change in its policy toward
access to information; now any Bank document that is not on a list of
exceptions is publicly available. The Bank also enhanced its efforts to report
on results by using a standardized set of core indicators at the country, sectoral, and institutional level and is developing a corporate score card to
monitor effectiveness as well as progress on internal reforms.

Open Data Initiative

In April 2010 the World Bank launched its Open Data Initiative, making its
public databases open to all users, readily accessible, and searchable on the
Web. The new data policy provides free access to more than 2,000 financial,
business, health, economic, and human development indicators, previously

 

WORLD BANK WORK IN A VOLATILE CLIMATE Wavailable only to paying subscribers. The decision—part of the Bank's larger
effort to increase access to information—means that researchers, journalists,
nongovernmental organizations, entrepreneurs, and schoolchildren alike
will be able to access the World Bank's databases. A new Data Catalog lists all
key databases, such as the World Development Indicators, Africa Development Indicators, Global Economic Monitor, Doing Business, and Global
Development Finance, and new databases will continue to be added. (See
http://data.worldbank.org.)

The Open Data Initiative will encourage innovative analysis of development issues and problems and stimulate evidence-based policy making in
developing countries. The initiative responds to the growing demand for
data and also illustrates the need to support efforts of national institutions
that produce the data.

Data.worldbank.org offers full access to data from more than 200
economies, with many time series going back 50 years. For the first time,
more than 1,000 indicators are in languages other than English (French,
Spanish, and Arabic). Users will be able to download entire datasets for a
particular country or indicator, quickly access raw data, click a button to
comment on the data, and e-mail and share data with social media sites.

Access to Information Policy

The Executive Directors approved a major new Access to Information policy in November 2009. Together with the seven internal reforms implemented in fiscal 2010, the new policy positions the World Bank as a transparency leader among international financial institutions. The driving force
behind this paradigm shift was the desire to increase transparency, public
ownership, partnership, and participation in the Bank's operations and
projects by a broad range of external stakeholders.

The policy greatly increases public access to Bank information. The old
policy disclosed an established set of information and did not allow the
public to appeal disclosure decisions. The new policy provides that any information in the Bank's possession, unless covered by a well-defined list of
exceptions, is publicly available. It also gives the public the ability to appeal
Bank decisions to deny disclosure. Information never before available to the
public, including Board transcripts and minutes of Board Committee meetings, is now publicly available, with the Bank routinely posting as much information as possible on its external Web site. Any information not covered
by the exceptions list is available upon request. Certain information on the
exceptions list may be eligible for declassification after 5, 10, or 20 years,
depending on the document type.

Designed to maximize the public's access to information, the policy
also respects confidential information from clients, shareholders, employees, and other parties. The policy ensures that the Bank and its clients and
partners are able to discuss matters frankly before reaching a decision. The
deliberative process remains protected, but interested parties have access
to key decisions at the end of certain deliberative processes, such as those
resulting from supervision missions.

One of the more innovative and progressive elements of the new
policy is the introduction of an appeals mechanism for parties whose
requests for information have been denied. An internal administrative

 

appeals body serves as the first stage of appeal; an independent body
of international experts serves as the second stage for certain types of
appeals.

Implementation of this new policy was itself an open and collaborative
effort that involved both internal and external consultations. Numerous
vice presidential units collaborated to develop the many systems, guidelines, and procedures that were required to put the policy into effect on
July 1, 2010. From the start, civil society groups were invited to participate
in various stages of policy development and implementation. They provided valuable inputs into the design of the policy, offered advice during
the preparation stage, and helped the Bank test the new public request
system in the months leading up to implementation. (See http://www
-worldbank.org/wbaccess.)

Integrity

The work of the World Bank's Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) is critical to
ensuring that development resources reach their intended beneficiaries.
INT's mandate is to detect, deter, and investigate fraud and corruption that
may affect World Bank Group-financed activities and take action to sanction errant firms. This year INT introduced a preventive function to support
mitigation on integrity risks and offer technical advice to project teams.

INT conducts its administrative investigations according to internationally accepted good practice and, as an advocate for the World Bank,
presents case findings for the ultimate decision to the Sanctions Board.
Since July 1, 2009, the World Bank has debarred 45 firms and individuals
from participating in World Bank-funded activities. In the past year INT has
referred cases to 31 national authorities for criminal investigation and possible prosecution.

In April 2010 the African Development Bank, the Asian Development
Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the InterAmerican Development Bank Group, and the World Bank Group signed an
agreement to cross-debar firms and individuals found to have engaged in
wrongdoing in projects financed by multilateral development banks. This
landmark agreement follows an extensive process aimed at harmonizing
efforts and resources to address fraud and corruption at the global and
regional levels. (See http://www.worldbank.org/integrity.)

MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS
AND POVERTY REDUCTION
As a result of the global crisis, millions of people who would otherwise
have moved out of poverty remained poor, and millions of others who
would not otherwise have fallen into poverty became poor. Remarkably,
however, the immediate impact of the crisis on development indicators in
low-income countries was not as severe as it could have been because
the brunt of the blow fell on middle-income countries. Growth in lowincome countries declined by less than expected, and many poor countries maintained their spending on social protection.

To promote economic recovery, the Bank has scaled up its support
for inclusive growth analyses through the Diagnostic Facility for Shared
Growth. The objective of this multidonor trust fund is to help better under
 

12 WORLD BANK WORK IN A VOLATILE CLIMATEstand how to accelerate growth
and create production employment opportunities for economic
actors in all income groups in
developing countries. The fund
also contains a rich knowledgemanagement agenda through
tools, training courses, and sharing
of cross-country experiences. The
total number of country studies
undertaken by Bank country
teams that have been supported
by this trust fund rose to 33 in
2010 from 22.

Progress toward meeting the
Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) by 2015 is evident, particularly with regard to poverty, which
has fallen in all regions over time.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND
DEVELOPMENT

Climate change—higher temperatures, changes in_ precipitation
patterns, rising sea levels, and
more frequent weather-related disasters—pose risks for people, agriculture, energy, and water supplies all over the world, but its
effects are expected to be felt the
most in developing countries, the
very countries that are least prepared to deal with them. At stake
are recent gains in the fight against
poverty, hunger, and disease, as
well as the lives and livelihoods of
billions of people.

Despite increases in the world’s
population, the number of people living in extreme poverty in the world is
falling, thanks to rapid progress in China and India. These advances are
probably not enough to halve the number of people in the world living on
less than $1.25 day or the proportion of people who suffer from hunger by
2015 however, particularly given the continuing effects of the food crisis in
Africa. Good progress has been made toward achieving universal primary
education and gender equality in primary education, with the ratio of girls
to boys rising in all regions to at least 90 percent.

The immediate consequences of the crisis have been less devastating
than they might have been. However, the longer-term consequences remain worrisome because crises tend to have severe and lagging impacts
on health, education, employment, and poverty indicators, particularly on
infants and children, especially girls. During downturns, infant mortality
rates rise, school enrollment and completion rates fall, and food consumption by infants and children declines, leading to increased stunting. Evidence from 189 countries for 1980-2008 shows that MDG indicators deteriorate during economic crises and improve during economic expansions.
The impact is highly asymmetric, however, with the deterioration during
bad times much greater than the improvement during good times.

Making progress toward the MDGs will require substantial additional
assistance from donors, particularly for Africa, where the Group of Eight
Gleneagles commitment to double official development assistance by
2010 has yet to be reflected in core development aid to the region. Aid to
Africa has grown 5 percent a year since 2000, but much of it has been
debt relief or emergency and humanitarian assistance rather than new
finance. Reaching the 2010 target would have required an increase of $20
billion in 2009 and 2010, only about $2 billion of which was programmed.

 

Climate change issues are so
important to the developing world that the Bank is integrating them into
all of its new sector strategies and intensifying its efforts to support climate
risk management in its core operations. A progress report to the Bank's
Board in May 2009 on the Strategic Framework for Development and
Climate Change revealed the unprecedented growth in demand and appreciation from developing countries for World Bank Group support in
this area.

Bank support, which includes IBRD and IDA (as well as Trust Funds)
to low-carbon investments rose to $3.9 billion this fiscal year, up from $2.4
billion in fiscal 2009. The Bank also stepped up support for energy access
and reliable supply and implemented new climate risk-management
products and financing mechanisms, such as green bonds. The MultiCat
Program, launched by the Bank in October 2009, is a catastrophe bond issuance platform that gives governments and other public entities access
to international capital markets to insure themselves against the risk of
natural disasters. Since the product was introduced in November 2008,
green bonds have raised over $1.5 billion in 15 different currencies, of
which $840 million was raised in fiscal 2010 alone. The governing body of
the Bank-managed Climate Investment Funds’ (CIF’s) Clean Technology
Fund (CTF) also endorsed new investment plans to scale up financing for
demonstration, deployment, and transfer of low-carbon technologies.
There are now 13 plans in place around the world and some $4.3 billion of
CTF cofinancing allocated to projects ranging from solar power development to the greening of public transportation systems. It is estimated that
an additional $36 billion will be leveraged in the coming years from other
sources, including the private sector, bringing the total to be mobilized
through the CIF's more than $40 billion.

 

WORLD BANK WORK IN A VOLATILE CLIMATE. 13Adaptation to climate variability and change remains at the
center of Bank support to developing countries. IDA15 emerged as
the impetus for rapidly evolving financing for climate-resilient action.
This year the Bank expanded support to investments in climateresilient and low-carbon projects
and technologies by leveraging
a suite of financing instruments,
technical assistance, and policy
advice, often blending Global Environmental Facility resources with
regular IBRD/IDA or IFC instruments to support climate change
initiatives. The Pilot Program for

Strategic Climate Fund initiated
activities in nine IDA countries this
year, including three in Africa and
four in fragile states. Similarly, the

As part of its commitment to
corporate responsibility, since 2005
the World Bank Group has implemented a comprehensive program to measure, manage, reduce,
offset, and report on greenhouse
gas emissions associated with its
global business operations, including key meetings and air travel.

Forest Carbon Partnership Facility,
designed to build global capacity
under the international Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest
Degradation Program, now has commitments of $165 million.

In the run-up to the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference
in Copenhagen, the Bank released several regional and sectoral flagship
reports on climate change; helped to finalize low-carbon growth studies
on Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, and South Africa; and
published the World Development Report (WDR) 2010: Development and
Climate Change. The report urges the countries that produced most of the
greenhouse gas emissions in the past to act now to shape the world’s climate future by ramping up funding for adaptation and mitigation in developing countries, where most growth in emissions will occur. The WOR
was complemented by “The Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change,’
which estimates that it will cost $75 billion to $100 billion a year between
2010 and 2050 to adapt to climate change.

In December 2009 the Bank launched the Carbon Partnership Facility
(CPF), which seeks to go beyond the project-by-project approach of the
first generation of carbon funds. The CPF adopts programmatic approaches
to assist developing countries in pursuing low-carbon growth and leveraging capital for clean technologies. By the end of the fiscal year €109 million, the equivalent of $152.6 million, had been raised for the new facility.
This year also saw the approval of the Scaling-up Renewable Energy Program of the Strategic Climate Fund under the CIF. The new program will
demonstrate the economic, social, and environmental viability of lowcarbon development pathways in the energy sector in low-income countries. In March 2010 the Board of the Adaptation Fund approved the World
Bank as one of its implementing agencies.

Global Reporting Initiative Indicators and is the first multilateral development bank to report to the Carbon Disclosure Project. (See http://crinfo
-worldbank.org/corporate_reporting/index.)

In addition, the World Bank has instituted a number of initiatives to reduce the environmental footprint of its day-to-day operations. For example,
Bank publications adhere to Green Press Initiative standards, and its newest
building is certified to green building standards. (See http://crinfo.world
bank.org/environmental_responsibility/sustainable_facilities.)

AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT

High and volatile food prices—as well as the impact of the global financial
crisis—continued to increase food insecurity in 2009, with the annual
World Bank food benchmark index rising 23 percent. Although the index
was 17 percent lower than in 2008, prices remained higher than in 2007.
The high volatility of food prices exacerbated the hardships faced by the
world’s poorest people, about 1 billion of whom are undernourished.

To provide immediate relief to countries hit hard by the rise in food
prices, in 2008 the World Bank set up the Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP). Support to the GFRP rose by $87 million, to $1.24 billion this
fiscal year, up from $1.15 billion in fiscal 2009. Of this, $202 million is from
the Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund, $838.8 million is from IDA, and
$200 million is from IBRD. The money is used to feed poor children and
other vulnerable groups; provide nutritional supplements to infants, young

 

14 WORLD BANK WORK IN A VOLATILE CLIMATEchildren, and pregnant and lactating women; meet additional expenses of food imports; and enable
poor farmers to improve their agricultural productivity through enhanced food production and marketing response. By the end of
fiscal 2010 the Bank had mobilized
more than $352 million in externally funded trust funds in support

The Bank is responding to the
short-term effects of the food and
financial crises, but it is embedding
its actions within strategies that
address longer-term challenges. In
July 2009 it adopted a new action

operational pillar will be led by
a new legal entity, a consortium
of the CGIAR-supported research
centers. Under the new business
model, funding will support a
set of global research programs
aligned with a new strategy and
results framework. Accountability
will be ensured through performance agreements between the
Fund Council and the consortium,
and through a mutually agreed on
monitoring and evaluation framework. The resource mobilization
target for the CGIAR is to increase
resources from $600 million in
2009 to an annual level of $1 billion by 2014.

http://www.worldbank.org/rural.)

At the Group of 20 Summit in Pittsburgh in September 2009, world
leaders asked the Bank to create a multilateral mechanism to help implement the pledges made in LAquila, Italy, in July 2009. The new mechanism—the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP)—will
help fill financing gaps in country and regional agriculture and food security strategies in order to help countries achieve MDG 1 (eradicating extreme poverty and hunger) by 2015. In January 2010 the Bank's Board approved, subject to minor revisions, the GAFSP framework document,
prepared following extensive stakeholder consultations. By the end of fiscal 2010, donors had committed almost $900 million to GAFSP over three
years, and the program had allocated $224 million for country-devised
and -led agricultural development plans in Bangladesh, Haiti, Rwanda,
Sierra Leone, and Togo. (See http://www.worldbank.org/GAFSP.)

The Bank continued its support of the ongoing reform of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), which mobilizes
cutting-edge science to reduce hunger and poverty, improve human nutrition and health, and protect the environment. A new model for CGIAR
that emphasizes results-oriented research and clear accountabilities between the implementers and funders of agricultural research was approved at the CGIAR meeting in December 2009. The financing pillar of the
partnership is a new CGIAR trust fund, governed by a Fund Council that

EDUCATION, HEALTH, AND SOCIAL PROTECTION AND LABOR
The global crisis has had devastating effects on human development
achievements in developing countries. In response the Human Development Network supported record levels of lending and knowledge services
in fiscal 2010. Together with the rest of the Bank, it redoubled its efforts to
help as many client countries and their development partners as possible to
achieve the transformational human and economic promise of the MDGs
within the next five years.

Education

The Bank is developing a new education strategy that will shape the
direction of its work for the next decade. Wide consultations were held
to ensure that the strategy reflects the views and experience of the
Bank's stakeholders. Phase | consultations took place from March through
the middle of June 2010. (See http://www.worldbank.org/education
strategy2020.)

New commitments for education in fiscal 2010 reached a historical
high of $4.9 billion, up from $3.4 billion in fiscal 2009. This new education
lending included $2.1 billion in IDA commitments to the world’s poorest
countries and $2.9 billion in support of middle-income countries. South
Asia received the largest share of new lending for education this year

 

WORLD BANK WORK IN A VOLATILE CLIMATE 15($1.43 billion), followed by Latin
America and the Caribbean ($1.35
billion).

A key focus in all new education projects is on improving educational quality. About half of all
new projects support primary education and include interventions
such as teacher training, schoolbased management, community
involvement in schools, and attention to marginalized populations.
About a quarter of new projects
focus on secondary and vocational
education with interventions to
help ensure that education builds
relevant skills to meet labor market
demands.

In March 2010 the Board approved two new education projects for India that provide $1.05

institutions across the country.

One of the projects, which supports improved learning outcomes and access to primary education, is the largest single operation in a country
since the Bank started lending to the education sector in 1962. This year,
the Board also approved new projects totaling more than $1 billion to
support education in Mexico. One of these operations supports upper
secondary education and represents the second largest operation for the
Bank in the education sector since 1962. (See http://www.worldbank
.org/education.)

Health, Nutrition, and Population

New investments in health, nutrition, and population (HNP) programs
reached an unprecedented $4.2 billion in fiscal 2010, a 48 percent increase over the previous year’s record commitments. The overall HNP
portfolio is at a historic high of $10.1 billion, more than half of which goes
to the poorest countries. These investments help strengthen health systems; boost the prevention and treatment of communicable diseases; and
improve hygiene, sanitation, and child and maternal health.

Together with developing-country and bilateral partners, civil society
organizations, academic institutions, the United Nations, and multilateral
agencies and foundations, the Bank contributed to the preparation of
Scaling Up Nutrition: A Framework for Action, which mobilized consensus and support for increased investment in nutrition interventions
across various sectors. In May 2010 the Board approved the Reproductive
Health Action Plan, which puts into operation the reproductive health

HIV/AIDS

The Bank disbursed $327.4 million to support all HIV/AIDS-related activities for existing operations with an HIV/AIDS component on prevention,
treatment, and mitigation programs. In fiscal 2010, eleven new projects
committed $193.26 million toward HIV/AIDS-related activities; over half
of this new lending was in the Africa region. As a segment of this new
HIV/AIDS lending, $127.4 million has been designated by the Regions
as contributing to the Bank's HIV/AIDS thematic classification. The Bank
completed 22 analytical products on HIV/AIDS, which helped to improve
program efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability through evidenceinformed responses.

Improving national HIV/AIDS strategies was a key goal of the Bank this
fiscal year. Through services provided under the AIDS Strategy and Action
Plan, the Bank helped 65 countries enhance their national HIV/AIDS responses by improving their understanding of the epidemic and associated risks and by developing evidence-informed national strategies and
costed action plans.

To strengthen HIV monitoring and evaluation systems, the Bank provided technical support to governments in more than 25 countries in Africa,
Latin America and the Caribbean, and Central Asia. In partnership with the
United Kingdom's Department for International Development, the Bank

 

16 WORLD BANK WORK IN A VOLATILE CLIMATElaunched an evaluation of community responses to HIV/AIDS to build
evidence on the impact of specific
activities and programs. A key
product of this exercise was the
development of a methodology
for carrying out a comprehensive
evaluation of the community response. Evaluation is ongoing in
two countries in Africa, to be followed shortly by another group
of countries. (See http://www

increased its ceiling to $1 billion for fast-track approvals of operations in the
Global Program for Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response. This funding, plus grants from the Avian and Human Influenza Facility, which to date has received $121 million from the
European Commission and nine other donors, is supporting country responses to avian influenza H5N1 and to the H1N1 pandemic. The responses
have been facilitated by preparedness investments by the Bank—in close
collaboration with global, regional, and country partners. Many countries
benefited from ongoing strengthening of veterinary and human health
systems, including disease surveillance and response capacity. The H1N1
pandemic provided countries with an opportunity to test their preparedness; it is now important to reflect those lessons in preparations for the next
influenza pandemic and other infectious disease outbreaks. Control of
avian influenza and other zoonotic diseases at their animal source is a vital
global public good.

Social Protection and Labor

In response to the global economic crisis, the Bank committed $8 billion
($4 billion in fiscal 2009 and $3.9 billion in fiscal 2010) to social protection
operations, quadrupling its annual precrisis lending volume, which averaged $1 billion over 2006-08. About 26 percent of operations were in lowincome countries in fiscal 2010, up from 13 percent in fiscal 2009. The majority of the $8 billion of commitments (fiscal 2009-10) went to social safety
nets for a total of $5.6 billion among 78 operations in 52 countries. The remaining lending was devoted to improving labor markets, social risk management, and other social protection areas, such as pension and disability.

GENDER

Efforts to promote gender equality increased this year, in part because of
the World Bank Group's Gender Equality as Smart Economics action plan,
which aims to promote women’s access to jobs, land rights, financial services, agricultural inputs, and infrastructure. By the end of fiscal 2010 the
four-year plan had raised $68.6 million for gender work in the economic
sectors and had financed some 260 activities in 78 countries. In June a
three-year roadmap was presented to the Board of Directors detailing
how the Bank can apply lessons learned to better integrate gender into its
operations beyond the close of the action plan in December 2010.

In March 2010 donors agreed to make gender one of four special
themes for IDA16. This designation will emphasize the integration of
gender in Bank operations and the coverage of key gender issues in analytical work and policy dialogue. In addition the results framework will be
strengthened and will include indicators for gender priority areas. IDA
will also implement an action plan to accelerate progress on the genderspecific MDGs.

The IDA16 replenishment comes at a time when IDA countries are
recovering from a succession of global crises that have posed a particularly serious threat to poor women and girls. Although women can
be especially vulnerable in crises, they can also be agents of change: if

 

WORLD BANK WORK IN A VOLATILE CLIMATE 7given greater economic opportunity, they can speed poverty reduction and development. To
this end the Gender Action Plan
set aside special funds this fiscal
year to support women through
strengthened social protection
programs and support for targeted
activities, such as female employment in public works programs.
During fiscal 2010 the Bank initiated a pilot dataset, Women,
Business and the Law, which focuses on the legal differentiation

that affect women's opportunities

The global financial crisis has increased the enormous challenge
of bridging this access gap by
weakening countries’ ability to
fund infrastructure development.
To meet client countries’ needs,
the Bank significantly scaled up its
support for infrastructure this fiscal year and deployed a range of
instruments to provide a coordinated and targeted response.

other countries, including Afghanistan, Jordan, Lao People’s Democratic
Republic, Nepal, and Rwanda, as well as in southern Sudan. The program
fulfills one of the six commitments senior management made in 2008 to
increase gender work.

Work is also under way on the other commitments. The 23 global and
regional business leaders who belong to the Private Sector Leaders Forum
have made a series of commitments to provide practical support for women's economic empowerment. Since 2008 IFC has channeled more than
$400 million to women in poor countries through microfinance institutions
and commercial banks.

In addition, during this fiscal year the World Bank decided to make gender and development the topic of the 2012 World Development Report.
Publication of the report will mark the first time in the series’ history that
gender is the central topic. The report will look at the state of gender
equality and the links between gender and development and identify
gaps in knowledge and data. (See http://www.worldbank.org/gender.)

that also support environmental
sustainability and social inclusion. In response to the deepening global financial and economic crisis, the Infrastructure Recovery and Assets (INFRA)
platform expanded on the action plan's mandate by increasing the Bank's
lending targets and supporting more effective collaboration with development partners.

Following a record $17.2 billion in infrastructure lending in fiscal 2009,
the Bank provided $23.2 billion in lending to the sector in fiscal 2010, putting
it on track to exceed INFRA’s target of $45 billion over fiscal 2009-11. Critical
investments in energy, transport, water, and information and communication technology will leverage and support initiatives by the private sector
and other multilateral development institutions, create jobs during the
downturn, and lay a foundation for robust and sustainable growth over the
longer term.

The core infrastructure access agenda remains the primary focus. This
agenda emphasizes strengthening sectoral policies and institutions to
improve the efficiency, affordability, quality, and reach of basic services.
The Bank continues to promote the sustainability of infrastructure services
through a proactive approach to evaluating environmental and social objectives. It also supports strong governance in the infrastructure sectors.

IBRD/IDA lending rose to $114 billion, with most of the funding coming
from IDA, which provided a total of $7.2 billion, including $1.7 billion in
grants. The largest single loan made to the region was a $3.75 billion IBRD
credit to Eskom Holdings Ltd., South Africa's state-owned utility. Approved
by the Board in April 2010, the loan will finance construction of a 4,800
megawatt coal-fired power plant that will use cleaner coal supercritical
technology. The funding includes $260 million for renewable energy (wind

promote ownership of the design,
implementation, and evaluation of development programs by Africans and
their governments and peoples; sharpen the focus on achieving development results; and ensure that the poor participate in and benefit from the
fruits of growth and development. Many of these changes are made possible
by the Bank's systematic use of the Africa Action Plan (AAP) as the framework
for delivering IBRD and IDA support to the region and by the increased presence on the ground: the number of internationally recruited staff based in
field offices, including offices in postconflict and fragile states, rose to 267 in
2010, up from 153 in 2007. Field-based offices were also granted greater decision-making authority, with the share of Bank tasks directly managed from
the field rising from 25 percent in 2007 to 32 percent in 2010.

of urban dwellers in Senegal with access to safe drinking water and significantly increased access for rural dwellers in Ghana and Rwanda. School
food programs set up with funding from the Global Food Crisis Response
Program benefited hundreds of thousands of orphans, vulnerable children,
and their parents. The program helped more than 16,000 school children in
Kenya. In Liberia such assistance provided a safety net for 15,000 vulnerable
people.

The Bank began implementing Phase II of its $1 billion Booster Program for Malaria Control in Africa. The program focuses on the Democratic
Republic of Congo and Nigeria, which together account for 30-40 percent
of all malaria cases in Africa.

Addressing HIV/AIDS in Africa

In fiscal 2010 the Bank filled critical gaps in HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment,
and mitigation programs, thanks to more than $200 million in disbursements and $89 million in new commitments, including additional financing to Malawi ($30 million) and Chad ($20 million), and a technical assistance loan for Lesotho ($5 million). In Africa the Bank focused its analytical
work on five areas: addressing the fiscal implications of scaling up national
AIDS responses given the need for an efficient, sustainable and long-term
response; evaluating the impact of HIV/AIDS services to improve key prevention interventions; strengthening health systems by analyzing and improving the existing supply chain networks; implementing guidelines for

funding improved road, rail, and port infrastructure, resulting in more fluid
trade and reductions in transit times in Cameroon, the Central African
Republic, and Chad.

Facilitating Progress toward the MDGs

Most African countries remain off track for meeting most of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs); their advances were further slowed by the
global crisis. Since the mid-1990s, however, Africa has made enormous
progress in improving social development indicators. Poverty has declined
at a rate of about 1 percentage point a year, and there is some evidence
that child mortality is beginning to fall sharply, with Ethiopia, The Gambia,
Malawi, and Rwanda experiencing declines of 25-40 percent in under-five
mortality in the past decade.

With a major effort by African governments, civil society, the private
sector, and the international community, Africa could meet the MDGs, if
not by 2015, then soon thereafter. Doing so would depend not only on the
efforts of the region's leaders and citizens but also on a development strategy articulated and owned by Africans. That development strategy is expected to emerge from the AAP consultations and from significantly
greater development assistance under a robustly replenished IDA16 and
other funding mechanisms. (See http://www.worldbank.org/afr.)

a concerted switch to renewable sources of power, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam could stabilize their greenhouse gas emissions while increasing energy security and improving local
environments.

Several new loans are helping countries in the region increase their
energy efficiency. In China, where more than 70 percent of the Bank's
program is related to the environment, a $100 million loan approved this
fiscal year is financing a major energy efficiency drive that will replace inefficient industrial equipment, such as boilers and district heating systems, with energy-saving technologies. Projects targeting improved and
more efficient urban transportation are helping major cities across China
reduce pollution and carbon emissions. In Indonesia a new DPL worth
$200 million is supporting efforts to develop a lower-carbon and more
climate-resilient growth path. This climate change DPL is envisioned as
the first of a series of four annual loans of similar size. The Bank is also
supporting a program of public investment reforms in Vietnam through a
series of DPLs aimed at strengthening the selection, preparation, implementation, and supervision of public investment projects. The first opera
in Cambodia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Vietnam; an earthquake
in Indonesia; and a tsunami in Samoa and Tonga. In response to requests
from each of the affected countries, Bank teams joined other development
partners to conduct postdisaster needs assessments, which gave governments a basis on which to prepare their recovery programs. The estimated
disaster bills ranged from $3.6 million in Mongolia to $4.4 billion in the
Philippines. The Bank's postdisaster support included technical assistance
for the development of a system to monitor reconstruction expenditures
in the Philippines; authorization of a doubling of the IDA allocation for
Samoa (to $40 million) to enable the preparation of an emergency response project; and $13 million in additional IDA grants to Lao PDR for
road reconstruction and the maintenance of food security.

Regional Integration and Cooperation

The Bank continues to strengthen its relationships with its core development partners across the region. It works closely with the Association of
South East Asian Nations, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum,
and the Pacific Islands Forum, regularly attending their regional meetings
and providing analytical and advisory support. In Samoa and Tonga the
Bank established shared offices this fiscal year with the Asian Development Bank to expand the reach of its development activities in the Pacific.

WORLD BANK WORK IN THE FIELD 23EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA

The financial crisis hit Europe and
Central Asia harder than any other
region in the world, and recovery
there will be slower than elsewhere. GDP grew at a robust rate
of about 7 percent in 2007 before
contracting to about -6 percent
in 2009. Because the drivers of
precrisis growth—capital flows,
high commodity prices, and strong
growth in export markets—are
unlikely to return quickly, growth
in 2010 is projected to be about
4 percent, and prospects for
2011-13 are only slightly better.

manitarian crisis, with rising unemployment and dimmer economic prospects making life even harder for
those already poor. Before the crisis the number of poor and vulnerable
people in the region was projected to fall by 15 million. Instead it rose
by 13 million in 2009, with Armenia, Georgia, the Kyrgyz Republic, and
Moldova particularly affected. The unemployment rate rose across the region, exceeding 10 percent in 2009 in Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,
the Slovak Republic, and Turkey. GDP fell in 20 of the region's 30 countries
in 2009, with annual national GDP growth ranging from 18 percent in
Latvia to 9.3 percent in Azerbaijan.

World Bank Assistance

Responding quickly to requests from countries in the region for help in addressing the crisis, the World Bank provided record lending of $10.8 billion
in support, including $10.2 billion in IBRD loans and $0.6 billion in IDA credits and grants. Much of the lending—$8 billion—was delivered in the form
of development policy loans (DPL). For example, a $1.3 billion DPL is help

services to member states on EU
issues and to potential candidate countries on accession issues, and expanding work on regional energy issues.

In February 2009 the World Bank Group, the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, and the European Investment Bank
launched the Joint International Financial Institutions Action Plan to
support banking systems and lend to the real economy in Central and
Eastern Europe—providing more than €16.3 billion in crisis-related
support to financial sectors in the region by the end of 2009. The Bank
also participated in the European Bank Coordination Initiative—or
Vienna Initiative—to foster dialogue between home- and host-country
banking supervisors, banks, the European Commission, and international financial institutions. The Bank's Vienna Centre for Financial Reporting Reform is partnering with the governments of Austria, Japan,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Switzerland to improve regulation
of financial reporting in both EU member states and several Europe and
Central Asia countries.

Investing in Energy for
Sustainable Growth

Although Russia and Central Asia
are currently major energy suppliers to both eastern and western
Europe, the outlook for primary
energy supplies, heat, and electricity is questionable for the countries
of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.

member countries of the fund: Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz
Republic, Russia, and Tajikistan.

Strengthening Safety Nets

Protecting safety net programs is critical to helping families deal with the
effects of the global crisis. The Bank worked with governments to assess
and improve national safety net programs, including a $144 million DPL
that is addressing the social impact of the crisis in Latvia; and DPLs to
Belarus ($200 million), Bosnia and Herzegovina ($111 million), Poland ($1.3
billion), and Serbia ($100 million) that are supporting efforts to improve
the efficiency of social spending.

Regional Integration and Cooperation

The median country in the region has fewer than 6 million people. Given
the relatively small size of some of the countries and the high level of
economic integration in the region, partnering is key for water and energy, transport, trade, corporate finance, and social inclusion. The Bank is
working to develop a Southeastern Europe Energy Community that will
establish a common regulatory framework for energy markets. It is helping craft regional transport solutions by assisting countries in their efforts to meet the transport requirements of the EU and ensuring that
national and regional transport networks are developed in a coordinated, sustainable, and efficient manner. The Bank is also working with
the European Commission on Roma exclusion issues, which affect numerous countries in the region, as well as providing support through
the Roma Education Fund.

Conducting Analytics to Inform Financial Support

Country and regional analytical work informs the Bank's financial support
in the region, including Regular Economic Reports for Russia, the EU10,
and Kazakhstan; Public Expenditure Reviews for Poland and Lithuania; and
Policy Notes in Moldova. The regional report Turmoil at Twenty underscores
the urgency of bank, corporate, and household debt restructuring in addressing the crisis, emphasizing renewed investment in skills and energy.
“Pensions in Crisis: Europe and Central Asia Regional Policy Note” looks at
how both the financial crisis and demographic trends have significantly
impacted pension systems in the region.

in primary energy development
and power sector infrastructure, as well as changes in behavior, the region
as a whole could face an energy crunch, moving from a net energy exporter to a net energy importer by 2030.

The Bank has energy efficiency projects in Bulgaria, Croatia, the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Poland, and Turkey. Programs to improve
the energy efficiency of public buildings, schools, and hospitals that also
improve educational achievement and health outcomes have been successfully implemented in Armenia, Moldova, and Serbia, using a range of
financing instruments and grants, including the Global Environment
Facility, Carbon Finance, and the new Clean Technology Fund. The Bank is
also helping FYR Macedonia, Russia, and Ukraine develop and implement
their national energy efficiency strategies.

Fostering Innovation

The Bank provided credit lines to Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Croatia, Moldova, and Turkey—countries in which small- and mediumsize enterprises faced a severe credit crunch—as well as assistance in
designing recovery growth strategies that focus mainly on diversification
and innovation.

The region held its third annual “Improving the Lives of People in
Europe and Central Asia” event in June 2010 to recognize innovative activities that have achieved concrete results on the ground. The winning
entries included projects that build roads connecting rural communities
with markets and urban areas in Armenia; improve the land titling system
in FYR Macedonia; expand health insurance coverage and improve access
to health services in Turkey; and protect the health and nutrition of the
poor in the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, and Tajikistan in the face of recent
global food price shocks. (See http://www.worldbank.org/eca.)

WORLD BANK WORK IN THE FIELD 25LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN

The economic downturn in 2009
proved less dramatic in Latin America and the Caribbean than in other
regions; it experienced a milder
than expected increase in unemployment; and its balance sheet
was not impaired by the crisis.
The region benefited from improvements in macroeconomic
and financial policy frameworks
that helped stabilize the economy.
In previous crises, factors such as
weak currencies, fiscal processes,
and banking systems had served to
magnify external shocks.

Several Latin American countries were able to implement
countercyclical policies for the first
time in decades. The effectiveness
of these policies was enhanced
by the sizable, flexible, and timely
provision of liquidity and budgetsupport financing from multilat

region, approving $13.9 billion in
new loans in fiscal 2010: $13.7 bilion from IBRD and $0.2 billion

By early 2010 the region's international reserves were more than three
times what they had been five years earlier. Public sector debt remained
manageable, averaging 30 percent of GDP, and the region did not undergo a banking crisis, despite weaknesses in the financial sector in other
regions.

The current pattern of global recovery has favored the region so far.
Countercyclical policies have supported domestic demand in the larger
countries, and external demand from fast-growing emerging markets,
especially China’s, has boosted exports and terms of trade for the region’s net commodity exporters. Prospects in the short term appear

To reduce the impact of the recession on poverty and employment,
especially in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, the Bank expanded lending and advisory activities to support social programs and
enhance employment opportunities for vulnerable groups. In El Salvador,
the Bank approved a loan that provides temporary income and job training activities in exchange for participation in a community project. A new
loan to Jamaica is helping expand conditional cash transfers to 360,000
beneficiaries to maintain their purchasing power and to ensure that high
school students graduate.

Natural Disasters

In January and February 2010, the
region saw its poorest (Haiti) and
one of its richest (Chile) countries
devastated by earthquakes.

The Bank has announced it
would provide $479 million to
support Haiti's recovery and development through June 2011. Of
this, $250 million is new funding,
which includes $151 million in
grants, a $39 million cancellation

Zoellick. The program will invest approximately $300 million over the
next two years to improve and expand these programs in the region.

Investing in Energy for
Sustainable Growth

Latin America and the Caribbean
produce just 6 percent of global
greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, many countries in the region have taken steps to reduce
emissions without sacrificing de
 

of Haiti’s remaining debt to the
Bank, and $60 million in investments from IFC. The Infrastructure and Institutions Emergency Recovery Project is restoring key economic and financial functions of the government and carrying out emergency rehabilitation of key public infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and administration
buildings in Port-au-Prince. The Bank is also providing technical assistance
to support key institutions and reconstruction planning.

Because of its extensive experience in managing multidonor funds in
other postdisaster situations, the World Bank was selected by the government of Haiti to serve as the fiscal agent for the multidonor Haiti Reconstruction Fund (HRF). This fund will pool public contributions and channel
resources to a large range of actors on the ground. The HRF will finance
reconstruction projects in alignment with the Haitian government's reconstruction plans.

Disaster management experts from the World Bank, in cooperation
with Google, Microsoft, Rochester Institute of Technology, and more than
a hundred institutions around the world, established a “situation room" at
the World Bank aimed at gathering and analyzing high-definition images
of damage in Port-au-Prince after the earthquake. This provided vital information to the Post Disaster Needs Assessment mission, cutting preparation time from weeks to 36 hours.

In Chile the Bank mobilized a $400,000 grant from the Spanish Fund for
Latin America and the Caribbean to support initial damage assessment. It
also provided technical expertise for analyzing aerial images and data furnished by Bank partner Crisis Camps, a grassroots movement that provides
critical solutions to communications in disaster-stricken areas.

Investing in Early Childhood Development

Most programs that support early childhood development in Latin America and the Caribbean are independent efforts that vary in scale, services
offered, and mode of delivery. National investments in early childhood
development account for less than 1 percent to about 12 percent of total
educational expenditures in the region. Programs reach only a small fraction of those who need assistance and face complex institutional coordination challenges.

In response the World Bank launched a new venture in February 2010,
the Early Childhood Initiative: An Investment for Life, a partnership with
ALAS Foundation, which was introduced at Bank headquarters by Grammy
Award-winning artist Shakira and World Bank Group President Robert B.

velopment. Bank lending in the
region in fiscal 2010 helped finance 11 projects with climate change
components, including trust fund operations. Projects related to energy
and the environment accounted for about a third of total Bank financing to
the region this fiscal year.

In October 2009 the Bank committed $1.5 billion to stimulate green
growth in Mexico, where a $150 million Bank loan is supporting the transformation of urban transportation.

Projects in Brazil and Mexico are introducing compact fluorescent
lighting, energy-efficient appliances, and new green building codes. Technical assistance and projects in Central America, Colombia, Mexico, and
Peru are promoting mini hydropower plants and off-grid rural electrification, reducing transmission and distribution losses. A $50 million Bank loan
to Peru approved this fiscal year is supporting environmentally sustainable
growth there.

Expanding the Conditional Cash Transfer

Programs beyond the Region

For more than a decade, the Bank has helped countries in the region develop homegrown conditional cash transfer programs, which alleviate
poverty by providing small subsidies to families to ensure that children
and youth receive regular health checkups and attend school. These programs have been replicated in 17 countries in the region, where they are
improving the lives of some 93 million people.

Conditional cash transfer programs are moving from first-generation
operational issues, such as ensuring that money reaches beneficiaries in a
transparent manner, to future challenges, such as integrating with other
programs that help people move out of poverty. Lessons learned in IBRD
countries are providing guidance for the expansion of conditional cash
transfer programs to IDA countries. (See http://www.worldbank.org/lac.)

The Year's ActivitiesHE FISCAL YEAR ending June 30, 1965, was the most

active in the history of the World Bank and its two affiliates, the International Development Association (IDA) and
the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Loans, credits
and other commitments amounted to $1.36 billion. The
Bank itself lent more than $1 billion for the first time in a
single year; IDA’s cumulative financing rose well above $1
billion; and IFC investments and other commitments were
at a higher level than before.

The Bank continued to grow in financial strength. Net
income totaled $137 million, and reserves stood at $895
million. Bank bonds were issued in North American and
European markets; the funded debt increased to $2,724
million. [IDA’s cumulative resources increased to $1,600
million. The increase included a $50 million allocation
from the Bank’s net income for 1963/64, as decided by
the Board of Governors at its Annual Meeting in September
1964. At June 30, 1965, IDA had committed all but $514
million of its available funds.

While the great preponderance of Bank and IDA lending
continued to be for basic public utilities, operations in support of agriculture and education by both the Bank and
IDA expanded, pursuant to policies announced during the
previous year. The total of educational financing more than
doubled, while cumulative lending for agricultural projects
increased by about $167 million.

Greater emphasis was given to industrial development.
By the close of the fiscal year, member governments had
nearly completed action on a proposal to increase IFC’s
financial resources by authorizing the Bank to lend to the
Corporation. Within the World Bank group, IFC acquired
added responsibilities during the year: it now acts for the
whole group in the technical and financial appraisal, preparation and supervision of industrial and mining projects.
The Corporation’s activities in this respect are comparable
with its activities since 1962 in the field of development
finance companies.

Technical assistance activities were intensified. Funds
allocated for feasibility studies of individual development
projects and studies of sector development programs
exceeded the total spent for these purposes during the
previous four years combined.

The Executive Directors of the Bank completed work on
an international Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other
States and submitted the Convention to governments.

Increasing attention was paid to the international economic and financial environment in which the World Bank

group operates, discussed in Part Two of this Report.
Work continued on the studies undertaken by the Bank at
the request of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development. One of them, relating to the so-called ‘‘Horowitz Plan,’’ was completed and forwarded to the United
Nations.

The Commitments entered into by the World Bank
group during the year were composed as follows: The Bank
made 38 loans in 27 countries amounting to $1,023 million; IDA extended 20 credits to 11 countries totaling $309
million; and IFC made commitments (described in detail
in tFC’s own Annual Report) of $26 million to 15 enterprises in 11 countries.

Over the years, two-thirds of all Bank and IDA financing
has been for basic projects for the generation and transmission of power and for transportation, in roughly equal
amounts. During the year 1964/65, however, transportation gained a sizable lead with loans and credits in 19
countries totaling $522 million, bringing the cumulative
total for such projects as railways, roads, waterways, ports
and pipelines to $3,415 million. The power sector accounted for loans and credits of $360 million to 13 countries and accumulative total of $3,127 million. Other sectors
benefiting from Bank and IDA financing during the year,
in order of magnitude of lending, were industry $194 million, agriculture $167 million, telecommunications $33
million, education $29.5 million and water supply $27
million.

In addition to increasing the volume of their financing,
all three institutions extended the geographical scope of
their operations, raising to 86 the number of countries and
territories in which one or more have made loans, credits,
investments or other commitments. The Bank made its
first loans in Jamaica and Sierra Leone, and made its first
loan to Gabon since that country became independent in
1960. It also resumed lending operations in Brazil, making
loan commitments there for the first time since 1959. IDA
became the first of the three institutions to finance development projects in Afghanistan, Bechuanaland, Bolivia
and Somalia, and it extended credits for the first time to
Kenya, Mauritania and Nigeria. IFC made investments in
enterprises in three countries where it had not operated
before: Ethiopia, the Ivory Coast and Uganda.

For the first time, a member of the World Bank group
engaged in joint financing of development projects with
the European Development Fund (FED) of the European
Economic Community; IDA and FED joined in financing
road projects in Mauritania and in Somalia.Bank Loans and IDA Credits 1964/65 by Area

Agriculture already had been the object of $549 million in Bank loans and $133 million in IDA credits through
fiscal year 1963/64, and in addition had been the beneficiary—sometimes the principal beneficiary—of many
transportation and power projects. However, the agricultural sector in many developing countries has continued to
lag seriously, yielding less food and fiber than it should to
keep pace with the growth of population and to meet the
rising needs of domestic industry. After careful! study, the
Bank decided to seek more effective solutions to this
many-faceted problem by giving stronger support to projects which involve a comprehensive approach to agricultural development.

Consequently, in the agricultural field the Bank and IDA
not only continue their traditional support of large construction projects such as flood control and irrigation
schemes, but are also becoming increasingly engaged
with broad land development programs comprising many
inter-dependent measures in the fields of training and extension work, farm credit, crop storage, livestock production, transportation and land settlement. Action to implement the policy was intensified during the year.

For example, the Bank lent $17.5 million to Morocco to
help carry out the Sidi Slimane project, a pilot program
to introduce modern intensive farming on 217,000 acres
and point the way to similar developments in other parts
of the country. The six-year program, initiated by the Government in 1962, encompasses the construction and improvement of irrigation works and drainage facilities,
improvement of farm-to-market roads, consolidation and
improvement of farms, provision of equipment to permit
the gradual adoption of modern methods, the completion
of 11 Agricultural Service Centers to provide a wide range
of equipment, supplies and technical assistance, and the
establishment and stocking of 13 dairy centers to form a
nucleus for the expansion and improvement of meat and
milk production. Associated with the project but not assisted by the Bank are a sugar mill, already in operation, a
dairy plant, a cotton gin, a citrus packing plant and a fruit
juice and preserves plant, all to be built by 1966.

Other examples of an integrated approach to agricultural development are: a loan of $12.7 million to Uruguay
for the second stage of a comprehensive and highly successful project to increase and modernize livestock production; a loan of $11 million to Peru for the third stage of
an irrigation project combining land development, farm
credit and many forms of technical assistance, which will
serve as a model for other parts of the country; a $15 million loan to Peru for an agricultural credit institution with
national coverage; and an IDA credit of $2.8 million for the
second stage of a project which promises to expand tea
production and raise the standard of living of African
smallholders in Kenya.

In October 1964, the Governing Council of the Food and

Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) ratified an agreement with the Bank which, it is hoped, may
increase considerably the number of agricultural projects
proposed for Bank and IDA financing. Under their agreement, FAO and the Bank are cooperating in the identification and preparation of projects to the point where they
can be considered for financing by the Bank or IDA. During
the year, 57 missions examined agricultural projects in 34
countries, and in April 1965, the Bank made a $8.5 million
Joan to Iran for the construction of feeder roads to connect
six productive agricultural areas with main highways; this
was the first Bank or IDA financing to result from studies
undertaken as part of the joint program with FAO.

FAO also will participate in the inspection of projects and
in appropriate cases may provide technical assistance for
their execution. While appraisal of projects remains the
exclusive responsibility of the Bank, FAO staff members
will increasingly form part of Bank appraisal missions.

In order to gather basic information relevant to agricultural planning in Africa, a mission organized by the Bank
continued a long-range study of experiences with the development of agriculture on that continent. The study will
be published in the first half of 1966, and is expected to
provide useful guidance to the Bank and others working
in this field. Two new permanent Bank missions in Africa
(see page 15) also will include agricultural projects among
their concerns.

FINANCING FOR EDUCATION

The World Bank group has been involved on a minor
scale in educational financing since 1962, when IDA extended a credit of $5 million to assist in the enlargement
of Tunisia’s secondary school system. By June 30, 1964,
the Association had approved additional credits of $17.6
million for educational projects in Pakistan and Tanzania.
In the spring of 1964, however, the Bank adopted a policy
of providing more active assistance to member governments in strengthening their ability to train people in the
varied skills required for economic development.

Accordingly, the Bank concluded an agreement with the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) similar to the one concluded with FAO, and
during the year 1964/65 Bank and Unesco experts examined educational projects in 17 countries. The cumulative volume of educational financing more than doubled as
new projects came forward.

The Bank itself made its first loan for education, one of
$6 million to help construct and equip buildings at the
College of Agriculture of the University of the Philippines,
as part of a comprehensive program to increase agricultural production and raise living standards.

IDA’s largest educational credit, of $20 million, was extended to Nigeria in March 1965 to assist in financing a
large number of projects involving the construction, expansion and equipping of secondary, technical and teacher-In Venezuela the Bank is helping to build roads through the highlands.
Bank loans are also aiding expressways around Caracas and Valencia
and electric power development in the east.

 

training schools, all badly needed to overcome a shortage
of trained manpower in industry, agriculture and government. IDA also approved a credit of $3.5 million to Afghanistan to help finance the construction and equipment of
seven vocational schools at the secondary level. By June
30, 1965, total educational financing by the Bank and IDA
amounted to more than $52 million.

FINANCING FOR INDUSTRY

Since 1962, IFC has acted for the World Bank group in
considering proposals for organizing or strengthening
industrial development finance companies, predominantly
private institutions which provide both financial and technical assistance for the expansion of existing industrial
enterprises and the establishment of new ones. During the
fiscal year under review, IFC was assigned responsibility
for overseeing all industrial projects to be financed by the
Bank, the Association or the Corporation.

By June 30, 1965, action was nearly completed by governments to amend the Articles of Agreement of both the
Bank and the Corporation, allowing the Bank to lend to
IFC up to four times the Corporation’s capital and surplus
without governmental guarantees. The amendments will
add about $400 million to IFC’s potential resources for
lending to private industry in the developing member
countries, further enhancing the Corporation's role as the
group’s instrument for industrial development.

A large part of the World Bank group's financing for industry during the fiscal year was in support of industrial
development finance companies, which have become a
highly successful mechanism for the development of private industrial enterprises, especially of small and medium
size. Beginning in 1950, the Bank group has assisted 19
finance companies in 17 countries with commitments totaling $383 million. With these and other resources, the
companies have provided in the neighborhood of $1,000
million for the development of industry. In addition, some
have helped to develop the capital market for industrial
securities by entering into standby or underwriting arrangements in support of new industrial issues.

During 1964/65, the Bank lent $50 million to the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, $15 million to the China Development Corporation and $14 million to the Industrialization Fund of Finland; IDA extended
two credits totaling $15 million to the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey; in the Ivory Coast, IFC subscribed
some $200,000 of the capital of the new Banque Ivoirienne de Développement Industrie!, and in Spain it doubled its share subscription to the Banco del Desarrollo Econdmico Espafiol to a total of about $585,000.

Near the close of the fiscal year, the Bank made a loan of
$100 million to the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno (the Southern
Italy Development Fund) to assist the development of industry in Southern Italy. The funds will be relent by the
Cassa to three special credit institutes which lend to in-Bank Loans and IDA Credits 1964/65 by Purpose

STAFF STUDIES

The Bank's effectiveness as a lender for development
depends in large measure upon its knowledge of the borrowing countries—their resources of land, materials and
manpower; their development plans and programs, together with the details of organization for their execution;
their past performance and future prospects in the light of
all relevant information. In the regular conduct of operations, the Bank has produced studies far its own purposes
on the economic position and prospects of some 95 countries and territories.

Such studies must be kept up-to-date to assist the Bank
in its consideration of proposals for financing and in providing assistance to members as new problems arise in
carrying out their plans. For this purpose, special missions
are sometimes organized, as in the case of Chile in 1961,
Colombia in 1962 and Mexico in 1963, to undertake a
thorough review of progress and of plans for further
investment.

During the fiscal year 1964/65 this type of activity was
expanded. Program review missions were organized to
conduct comprehensive studies in Argentina, Brazil, Ceylon, Nigeria, Paraguay, Peru, Turkey and Venezuela. They
involved the services of more than 60 specialists in the
principal economic sectors, as well as experts in development economics and institutions. Their studies, which will
not be made public, help to establish a perspective for
long-term financing by the Bank and IDA and, in some
cases, by other lending agencies as well. For example, in
the light of the report of the mission to Brazil, consideration was being given to new loan requests, to the country’s future needs for external capital and to the most effective means of providing outside assistance.

For at least a decade, the Bank has been increasingly
concerned with the rising burden which the service of external debt is placing on the balance of payments of the
underdeveloped countries (see page 57). During the year,
The Johns Hopkins Press published for the Bank a study,
“Economic Growth and External Debt,’ by Dragoslav
Avramovic and other members of the staff. The study
showed, among other things, that in the period 1955-62,
the public and publicly guaranteed debt of a representative sample of developing countries more than doubled,
and that amortization and interest payments on this debt
more than trebled. This study was an outgrowth of staff
work undertaken in response to requests from the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and
the Secretariat of the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD).

Work continued on a number of staff studies the Bank

was requested to conduct as a result of the deliberations
of UNCTAD. One of these was completed and forwarded
to the United Nations in February 1965; it dealt with the
‘Horowitz Proposal,’’ which was advanced by the Governor
of the Bank of Israel as a means of increasing the volume
of development funds available for lending on a multilateral basis at low interest and for a long term. Under
the proposal, funds would be borrowed in the private capital markets by IDA or some other international agency, primarily in the industrialized countries with surpluses in
their balance of payments, and re-lent to the developing
countries on concessionary terms. The plan contemplates
a system of guarantees by the industrialized countries in
support of such borrowings and the establishment of an
“interest equalization fund’’ to which they would contribute amounts required to subsidize the difference between
the borrowing and lending rates of interest. The Bank
study analyzed the technical problems involved and stated
the principal issues for consideration by governments.

Of the other studies going forward, one concerns a proposal by the United Kingdom and Sweden for a system of
supplementary financing to help mitigate adverse effects
on development plans of long-term and unpredictable
fluctuations in commodity prices. The Bank is also examining the implications for development of the use of suppliers’ credits and the possibilities for the establishment of
a system of multilateral investment insurance.

TERMS OF LENDING

In its own operations, the Bank continued to adjust its
lending terms, within limits consistent with sound practice, to fit the financial and debt service situation of its less
developed members. Relatively longer maturities and
grace periods were fixed in some cases, where this appeared appropriate in view of the useful life of the project,
the time required to bring it into productive use, or the
debt situation of the borrowing country. For example, the
Bank’s educational loan to the Philippines was for 30
years with a 10-year grace period; an $82 million loan for
the big Kainji Dam in Nigeria was for 35 years, with a 5year period of grace; two other power loans were for terms
of 26 years, while four loans for power, six for transportation, one for agriculture and one for a water supply project
were made repayable in 25 years.

During the year, the Bank considered whether it was
justified in continuing to make loans to more developed
countries, able to cover the bulk of their requirements
for external capital from market sources, at the same
interest rate as it charged to its less developed members.
As a result of this consideration, the Bank decided that it
would charge such countries rates of interest roughly comparable to those they pay when borrowing in the market.
These rates would be up to one per cent higher than the
Bank’s standard interest rate, which remained at 544%
during the year. Pursuant to this policy, a 25-year loan ofA $19.5 million Bank joan and a $13 million IDA
construction of the Roseir E lue Nile
dam make it possibie to bring a further 900,000 acres of land under cultivation.12

$75 million for an expressway in Japan carried an interest
charge of 644%, while 644% was charged on a 15-year
$100 million loan for industrial projects in Italy.

Within the World Bank group, however, it is IDA which
makes the most important contribution toward mitigating
the debt-service burden. All IDA’s credits have been for
50 years, repayable in easy stages after 10 years of grace
and with no interest except for a service charge of %4 of 1%;
but the need of the underdeveloped countries for financing on such terms continued to outrun the resources
available to IDA.

COORDINATION OF AID

The amount of international financial assistance available to the underdeveloped countries is limited, and the
need for better use and coordination of external aid continues to be urgent. The Bank took its first major initiative
to assist in the coordination of aid in 1958, when a critical
shortage of foreign exchange threatened to undermine
the development program of India. A group consisting
of the Bank and the capital-exporting countries most
directly concerned was organized to surmount the crisis
by mobilizing an adequate flow of external assistance. In
1960, a similar consortium was organized by the Bank for
aid to Pakistan. These consortia have met annually since
their inception. Both have served as vehicles for objective
comments on the economic performance and capital requirements of the recipient countries, and have served to
coordinate external aid and improve the terms on which it
is given. The Bank is also a member of consortia on Greece
and Turkey administered by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

For certain other developing countries, the Bank has
undertaken to organize consultative groups of interested
capital-exporting countries. These groups do not engage
in annual aid pledges but in other respects they are intended to serve the same purposes as the consortia. Since
1962, consultative groups have been organized for Colombia, Nigeria, the Sudan and Tunisia, in each case at the
request of the aid-receiving government. In addition, the
Bank is a participant in a consultative group for Ecuador
recently organized by the Inter-American Development
Bank.

During the fiscal year, the Bank carried out an intensive
review of the work of the groups it has organized, canvassing informally the views of major capital-exporting countries as well as of the developing countries for which consultative groups have been formed. Its conclusion was
that there continues to be a pressing need for effective
arrangements to coordinate aid, and that the organization
and administration of consultative groups is an appropriate and important function for the Bank to assume. At
the same time, it was recognized that each consultative
group requires a high degree of staff support in the maintenance of liaison and the preparation and exchange of

information concerning the recipient country’s economic
position, performance, problems and capital requirements.

As a result of its study, the Bank is working to enhance
the effectiveness of existing consultative groups. It is also,
within staff limitations, preparing to organize new ones, in
cases where the establishment of such a group is desired
both by the developing country and the principal capitalexporting countries concerned, and where it is likely that
the economic performance of the developing country
would be improved thereby.

SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES

One obstacle to economic growth has been uncertainty
on the part of private investors whether investments made
in many of the less developed countries would be secure
against other than normal business risks. As a step toward overcoming this difficulty and encouraging a freer
flow of private capital to the developing countries, the
Executive Directors of the Bank completed work during
the year on the text of a Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of
Other States. Drafting the text had occupied the Bank’s
legal staff for several years; and the advice of legal experts
from 86 member countries had been obtained in four
regional meetings. The final text was prepared by the
Executive Directors with the assistance of a Legal Committee consisting of representatives of 61 governments.
The Convention was sent to member governments in
March 1965, for their consideration with a view to signature and ratification, acceptance or approval.

The Convention provides for the establishment of an
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
as an autonomous institution under the auspices of the
Bank. The Centre will make available facilities for conciliation and arbitration, to which contracting states and investors who are nationals of other contracting states will
have access on a voluntary basis under rules laid down in
the Convention.

The Convention will enter into force 30 days after it has
been signed and ratified, accepted or approved by 20
governments. By the end of June 1965, the Convention
had been signed by the Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Tunisia and
the United Kingdom; the governments of Nigeria and Pakistan had notified the Bank that their signatures would be
added shortly, and they signed the Convention in July.

The Bank’s Finances

INCOME, LOANS AND REPAYMENTS of loans all set new records. The funded debt increased for the first time in
three years as the Bank returned to the capital markets of
Canada, Germany, Switzerland and the United States with
public borrowings equivalent to $300 million.

Combined net income and loan commissions totaled
$138 million, compared with the previous high of $131million in the fiscal year 1963/64. Loan commissions
amounted to less than $1 million, as compared to $33
million a year before. The reduction was due to the discontinuance of the practice of treating a part of loan charges,
amounting to 1% per annum on outstanding loans, as
commission and allocating the proceeds to the Special Reserve. The discontinuance took effect July 1, 1964, and
affected all but a few old loans totaling about $87 million
on that date. The 1% commission accrued on those loans
raised the Special Reserve to about $289 million at June
30, 1965.

Gross income for the year was $267 million, including
commissions, $15 million more than the previous record
of combined gross income and commissions. Bond and
note interest and issuance expenses were $107 million, an
increase of $5 million. Administrative costs rose by $3.2
million to $17.8 million. Expenditures for services to member countries totaled $4.5 million; these funds were spent
for economic surveys, project and sector studies, training
programs for officials of the less developed countries and
other technical and advisory services.

Loans held by the Bank on June 30, 1965, including
those not yet effective and net of exchange adjustments,
totaled $5,967 million, an increase of $775 million. Dis

Fiscal Years

 

bursements amounted to $606 million, compared with
$559 million in the previous fiscal year.

Borrowers repaid $137 million to the Bank and $163
million to investors holding maturities of Bank loans; the
total of $300 million was $33 million above the figure for
the year before. This brought cumulative repayments to
$1,886 million, including $909 million to the Bank and
$977 million to purchasers of its loans, while the cumulative total of joan sales reached $1,885 million by June 30,
1965.

At the same time, sales of loan maturities declined for
the third successive fiscal year under the combined impact
of rising yields on other securities in Europe, the Bank's
policy of not offering in the United States market portions
of loans to countries whose securities are subject to the
United States “Interest Equalization Tax’ and the voluntary program to reduce United States private commitments in the industrialized countries. Sales for the year
totaled $106 million, a reduction of $67 million from the
year before; sales from portfolio accounted for $76 million
and the balance of $30 million represented participations
by investors who agreed to take up parts of loans at the
time loan agreements were signed.

THE BANK’S FUNDED DEBT INCREASED during the year by
about $232 million; by June 30, 1965, the total of bonds
and notes outstanding was $2,724 million. The increase
reflected the Bank’s most active borrowing operations in
several years: in public offerings, the Bank borrowed Can$
25 million (US$ 23.1 million), DM 250 million (US$ 62.5
million), Sw F 60 million (about US$ 14 million) and US$
200 million, of which $17.9 million were sold under delayed
delivery arrangements, for a total of $299.6 million of new
bonds. The Canadian issue was the first in 10 years and
the German issue the first since 1959, while the Swiss and
United States issues were the first in three years.

Maturing bonds and notes totaling $298 million were refunded during the year. Two issues of 344% Notes held by
the Deutsche Bundesbank, denominated in U.S. dollars
and Deutsche Mark and totaling $198 million equivalent,
were exchanged for an equal amount of new Notes, approximately half of which mature in 1968/69 and bear interest
at 444%, while the remainder carry interest of 444% and become due in 1969/70. Another issue of $100 million of
334% Two-Year Bonds fell due on October 1, 1964, and
was refunded through the placement at par of an equal
amount of 444% Bonds with governmental institutions in
26 countries outside the United States.

Two maturities were paid off during the year; they consisted of Sw F 33.3 million (US$ 7.8 million) of a 338% loan
made to the Bank by the Swiss Government in 1957, and
Can$ 11.5 million (US$ 10.6 million) of 314% Bonds issued
in 1955. In addition, net sinking and purchase fund operations retired the equivalent of $31 million in Bank
obligations.

Interest rates on the new issues sold outside the United
States were considerably higher than in the past. The
United States issue of Twenty-Five Year 414% Bonds,
which was offered through an underwriting syndicate of
183 commercial banks and investment banking and
dealer houses headed by Morgan Stanley & Co. and The
First Boston Corporation, was offered to the public at
100% to yield 4.475% to maturity. The Canadian issue of
54%4% Twenty-Five Year Bonds was offered at 99% to yield
about 5.28%; it was underwritten and sold by a group of
Canadian investment banking and dealer houses led by
the Dominion Securities Corporation Limited, A. E. Ames
& Co. Limited and Wood, Gundy & Company Limited. The
German issue of Twenty-Year Bonds at 544%, the highest
rate ever paid by the Bank, was offered to the public at par
by a syndicate of some 70 German banking houses with
the Deutsche Bank as principal manager and the Dresdner
Bank as co-manager. The Swiss issue, which was sold by a
group of leading Swiss banking institutions headed by the
Union Bank of Switzerland, the Swiss Bank Corporation
and the Swiss Credit Bank, consisted of 434% EighteenYear Bonds offered at par.

UNDER A DECISION approved by the Board of Governors at
its Annual Meeting in September 1964, $50 million of the
Bank’s net income for the fiscal year 1963/64 was set

 

aside for transfer to IDA in the form of a grant, after $47
million of that year’s net income had been aliocated to the
Supplemental Reserve. After the close of the 1964/65
fiscal year, the Executive Directors allocated $62 million to
the Supplemental Reserve from net income for 1964/65,
raising that Reserve to $668 million, and recommended to
the Board of Governors that the balance of $75 million of
that year’s net income be transferred to IDA as a grant.

IDA's Finances

THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE to IDA for commitment in development credits have been in two principal forms: initial
subscriptions of members and supplementary contributions. The initial subscriptions of 18 high income member countries of IDA (called Part | countries) are payable
in gold or freely convertible currency; 10% of the subscriptions of the remaining 76 member countries (called Part II
countries) also is payable in gold or freely convertible
currency, while the balance is payable in the currencies of
the members and may be used by IDA only with their consent. Through fiscal year 1964/65, usable subscriptions
by both categories of members totaled $780 million. The
total included the first local currency subscriptions
to be released by Part Il countries for use by IDA,
totaling $4.6 million. Ireland, Israel and Jordan made all
of their subscriptions available in convertible form over a
period of five years; Panama paid a part of the local currency portion of its subscription in dollars; and Mexico
released pesos for procurement of items purchased in
that country under an !DA credit.

The Articles of Agreement provide for a periodic review
of the adequacy of the Association's resources. In 1962,
the Board of Governors requested the Executive Directors
to make such a review, and they prepared a report which
recommended that IDA’s resources be replenished through
supplementary contributions by Part | members. The recommendation was approved. Accordingly, agreed payments totaling $753 million, including the initial subscriptions of Belgium and Luxembourg, are being made in
three annual installments beginning in November 1965.
These funds are intended to cover IDA's requirements for
new commitment authority until at least June 30, 1966.

The cumulative total of IDA’s available funds includes
about $75 million from a number of other sources: the
World Bank grant of $50 million from net income for 1963/
64; $18 million in four special supplementary contributions by Sweden; and $6.7 million of net income since the
start of operations, including about $2.6 million in fiscal
year 1964/65.

The total of freely usable funds available to IDA from the
start of its operations amounted to $1,600 million at June
30, 1965 (see table). By the same date, IDA had extended
77 credits totaling $1,086 million, net of cancellations, including $309 million during the fiscal year under review;Usable Funds Available to IDA, 1960-65

and negotiations already were well advanced looking toward the commitment of a large portion of the funds still
available, which totaled $514 million. As the fiscal year
ended, it was expected that nearly all the resources available would be committed by the summer of 1966.

After the close of the fiscal year, the Executive Directors
of the Bank recommended to the Board of Governors that
$75 million from net income for 1964/65 be transferred to
IDA in the form of a second grant.

Actual disbursements by IDA reached a cumulative total
of $415 million, including $222 million disbursed in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1965,

Technical Assistance

LENDING OPERATIONS of the Bank and IDA and the usual
conduct of their relationships with member governments
and borrowers include in normal course many varieties of
technical assistance—advice in the preparation of projects,
counsel on the size and composition of development investments, recruitment of experts for particular development tasks, and many others. Some types of technical
assistance have been singled out for particular emphasis
and specific staff and budget support; but much, and perhaps most, technical assistance is rendered without special recognition, as part of normal operational activity. During the year just past, more resources of staff and funds
were devoted to technical assistance than ever before; but
this increased activity was only partly reflected in the expenditure of $4.5 million, in itself a record figure, recorded
under the Bank’s budget item, ‘Services to Member
Countries.”

In eastern and western Africa, where the problems of
development are particularly complex, the Bank has established permanent regional missions, primarily to assist
the governments in those areas to identify and prepare

specific projects for presentation to the Bank or IDA. These
missions have their offices in Nairobi and Abidjan, respectively. Initially, they are concentrating their efforts on agriculture and transportation, but eventually may give their
attention to projects in other sectors as well. Members of
the missions will be available to advise governments, both
on general policy issues in connection with projects and on
the solution of practical problems that arise in their preparation. They will not normally be involved in the appraisal or
supervision of projects or in the administration of existing
loans.

In addition to its other duties, the mission in Abidjan
will work in close association with the new African Development Bank (ADB). During the year the Bank has kept in
touch with the ADB in order to offer whatever assistance
may be appropriate. It is hoped that arrangements will in
due course be worked out for studying and financing possible projects of common interest, as well as for coordinating the activities of the two institutions more generally.

As in the past, the Bank stands ready to assist member
governments, at their request, in the formulation of general programs of development which can serve as a framework for investment and other measures conducive to
economic growth. For this purpose, the Bank has conducted comprehensive economic surveys in 25 countries;
the most recent was carried out in Morocco by a mission
which was completing its report at the end of the fiscal
year. The reports of similar missions to Kuwait and to Papua
and New Guinea were completed during the year and were
published for the Bank by The Johns Hopkins Press.

Bank assistance in bringing development projects and
programs to the point of readiness for financing also was
expanded. More funds were allocated for this purpose during the fiscal year 1964/65 than had been spent during
the previous four years combined. The following table
summarizes the year’s allocations:

During the year the Bank concluded its assistance to the

16

 

Ecuadorean Institute of Electrification in the preparation of
a national electrification plan. The study of coal transport
problems in India, a general transport survey in Zambia
and a study to improve school building designs in Tunisia
were completed.

A Bank team headed by Dr. Pieter Lieftinck and assisted
by a number of consultants completed the first part of a
study of the water and power resources of West Pakistan,
financed by the Indus Basin Development Fund which is
administered by the Bank. This phase of the study concerned the technical feasibility, construction cost, and
economic return of a dam on the Indus River at Tarbela.
The second part of the study, which is a broad examination
of the development potential of the water and power resources of West Pakistan, was still in progress.

Besides conducting project and sector studies on its
own account, the Bank also acts as the Executing Agency
for many similar studies financed by the United Nations
Special Fund. During the year, field work was organized on
four such projects: feasibility studies in connection with the
development of irrigation and power facilities in the Yaque
del Norte and Yaque del Sur River basins in the Dominican
Republic, a transport survey in Surinam and a study of
telecommunications needs in Pakistan. Studies of port and

railway development possibilities in Costa Rica and of the
potential of coal deposits in Colombia's Cauca Valley were
completed, as was field work on a study of iron ore transport facilities in Gabon. The scope of surveys of power development for South Central Brazil and of mineral resources in Surinam was extended. Field work was completed and reports were being prepared on port studies in
Thailand. The Bank agreed to act as Executing Agency for
four more Special Fund projects: studies of highway development in Western Nigeria and Somalia, of transport
requirements in southern Cameroon and the Central African Republic, and of highways and ports on the southern
Atlantic coast of Nicaragua.

In other technical assistance activities of the year, a
Bank mission completed a comprehensive survey of the
capital market in Chile and recommended measures for
the mobilization of private savings through financial institutions and for improving the operation of the stock
market. A report on the securities market in Pakistan, prepared by a consultant engaged by the Bank, was submitted
to the Government and was supplemented by further advisory assistance in the preparation of a stock exchange
law. A survey of the securities market was conducted in
Peru, and a five-man mission, including experts from the
Bank and the International Monetary Fund, completed a
study of budgetary and fiscal policies in Portugal.

Members of the Bank staff were seconded during the
year as planning or development advisers in Colombia,
Jamaica, Libya, East Pakistan and the Sudan; similar
assignments were completed in Kuwait and Malaysia. The
Bank also provided short-term economic advisers to the
Governments of Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Zambia and to
the National Development Council in Argentina. In addition
to the permanent missions in western and eastern Africa,
already mentioned, resident members of the Bank’s staff
provided assistance in the preparation or execution of
agricultural or transportation projects in Chile, Colombia
and the Philippines; others served in the Philippines as
advisers on statistics and industry.

The Bank also agreed to allocate $830,000 over three
years to help continue the services of a group of advisers
organized by Harvard University who have been assisting
the Planning Commission of Pakistan and the East and
West Pakistan Planning Departments. Previously, financial
support for these advisers was provided by the Ford
Foundation and the United States Agency for International
Development.

THE BANK’S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE, a staff
college for senior government officials who deal with
economic and financial problems of development, began
its tenth year. During 1964/65, the Institute conducted
general courses on economic development in English and
French, project evasuation courses in English and Spanish,
and an industrial project evaluation course in English.\n addition, the Institute offered a special project evaluation
course in Jaipur, India, for participants from four Asian
countries. Through the end of June 1965, 460 officials of
91 countries had participated in EDI courses, including
143 during the fiscal year 1964/65.

MEMBERSHIP AND
ADMINISTRATION

FOR THE FIRST TIME in four years, there were no changes in
membership of the World Bank. Eight countries increased
their capital subscriptions: Costa Rica from $8 million to
$10.7 million, Dominican Republic from $8 million to
$13.3 million, Honduras from $6 million to $8 million,
Italy from $360 million to $666 million, Malaysia from $50
million to $133.3 million, Panama from $400,000 to $9
million, Sudan from $20 million to $60 million and United
Arab Republic from $106.6 million to $142.1 million. At
the close of the fiscal year, subscribed capital of the Bank
was $21,669.4 million.
Belgium became the 94th member of IDA.

AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR, the staff serving the World
Bank and IDA numbered 1,094 employees from 65
countries,

The President designated certain senior officers to serve
as the President’s Council, each taking cognizance over
particular sectors of activity and over the departments and
offices responsible for them. The members of the Council
are J. Burke Knapp, Geoffrey M. Wilson and Simon Aldewereld, Vice Presidents; A. Broches, General Counsel;
Richard H. Demuth, Director of the Development Services
Department; and Irving S. Friedman, The Economic Advisor to the President.

Mr. Aldewereld, who was appointed a Vice President
during the year, will continue to serve as Director of the
Projects Department (formerly the Technical Operations
Department).

Mr. Irving S. Friedman was appointed to a newly created
post as The Economic Adviser to the President. He had
been Director of the Exchange Restrictions Department of

the International Monetary Fund since 1950. Mr. Andrew
M. Kamarck was appointed Director of the Economics
Department; he had been Economic Adviser to the Africa
Department. Mr. Dragoslav Avramovic was promoted from
Assistant Director of the Economics Department to be
Director of Special Economic Studies.

Mr. Abdel G. El Emary became Director of the Africa
Department, succeeding Mr. Pierre L. Moussa, who resigned to become President of the Fédération Francaise
des Sociétés d’Assurances. Mr. El Emary previously had
been Director of the Department of Investments, Africa,
Asia and Middle East, of the International Finance
Corporation.

Mr. Michael L. Lejeune, who had been Assistant Director
of the Far East Department, was appointed Director of
Administration, succeeding the late Mr. William F. Howell.

Mr. Alexander Stevenson, who had been Assistant
Director of the South Asia Department, became Director,
succeeding Mr. Escott Reid. Mr. Reid became a consultant
in the Office of the President, prior to taking up a university
post in Canada in July 1965.

The first group of appointees under the Junior Professional Recruitment Program completed 18 months of
rotational assignments, and were confirmed in permanent
appointments to the staff. This group numbered 11; two
additional groups totaling 20 are still in training; a fourth
group of 20 has been appointed and will arrive in Washington in October 1965. The Program brings outstanding
young university graduates into the Bank for intensive
in-service training, working in atleast two departments and,
in most cases, taking part in one or more field missions to
member countries. Upon successful completion of their
training, they are assigned to regular staff positions. The
recruits have averaged 27 years of age at the time of their
appointment and they have come from 27 countries on
6 continents.

The countries represented in the program and the
number of junior professionals from each are: Argentina 1,
Austria 2, Belgium 2, China 1, Colombia 1, Cuba 1, France

JUNE 30, 1965

NOTE A

Amounts in currencies other than United States dollars have been
translated into United States dollars:

(i) In the cases of 66 members, at the par values as specified
in the ‘Schedule of Par Values”, published by the International
Monetary Fund;

(ii) In the cases of the remaining 36 members [Algeria, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad,
Chile, China, Colombia, Congo (Brazzavilie), Democratic Republic of Congo, Dahomey, Gabon, Guinea, Indonesia, Ivory Coast,
Kenya, Korea, Laos, Malagasy Republic, Mali, Mauritania, Nepal,
Niger, Paraguay, Peru, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Upper Volta, Viet-Nam and Yugoslavia},
at the rates used by such members in making payments of capital subscriptions to the Bank; and

(iii) In the case of Swiss francs, non-member currency, at the
rate of 4.2975 francs to 1 United States dollar.

See also Notes B and C.

No representation is made that any currency held by the Bank is
convertible into any other currency at any rate or rates.

NOTE B

These currencies of the several members, and the notes issued
by them in substitution for any part of such currencies as permitted under the provisions of Article V, Section 12, are derived
from the portion of the subscriptions to the capital stock of the
Bank which is payable in the currencies of the respective members (such portion being hereinafter called restricted currency).
Such restricted currencies may be loaned by the Bank, and funds
received by the Bank on account of principal of loans made by the
Bank out of such restricted currencies may be exchanged for
other currencies or reloaned, only with the approval in each case
of the member whose restricted currency is involved; provided,
however, that, if necessary, after the Bank's subscribed capital
is entirely called, such restricted currencies may, without restriction by the members whose currencies are offered, be used or
exchanged for the currencies required to meet contractual pay
ments of interest, other charges or amortization on the Bank’s
own borrowings or to meet the Bank’s liabilities with respect to
contractual payments on loans guaranteed by it.

Under Article Il, Section 9, each member is required, if the par
value of its currency is reduced or if the foreign exchange vaiue
of its currency depreciates to a significant extent in its territories,
to maintain the value of the Bank’s holdings of its restricted currency, including the principal amount of any notes substituted
therefor, and the Bank is required, if the par value of a member’s
currency is increased, to return to the member the increase in
the value of such restricted currency held by the Bank. To the
extent such restricted currencies are out on loan, the Bank and
the members are obligated to make such payments only when
such restricted currencies are recovered by the Bank.

The equivalent of $1,650,408 is due from 2 members in order
to maintain the value of their restricted currencies as required
under Article tl, Section 9.

Some members have converted part or all of the Bank’s holdings
of their restricted currency into United States dollars to be used
and reused as United States doliars in the Bank’s operations,
subject to the right of the Bank or the member to reverse the
transactions at any time, with immediate effect as to dollars then
held by the Bank, and, as to dollars loaned, upon repayment of
the loans. Such dollars while held by the Bank or on joan are not
subject to the provisions of Article Il, Section 9. Such dollars held
by the Bank or repayable on loans are shown in these financial
statements under "United States dollars'’ and, where relevant,
as “unrestricted”.

NOTE C
The principal disbursed and outstanding on loans and the accruals for interest, commitment charge, service charge and loan
commission are receivable in United States dollars and other currencies (for which the dollar equivalent is shown) as follows:

Notes to Financial Statements

 

JUNE 30, 1965

NOTE A
Amounts in currencies other than United States dollars have been
translated into United States dollars:

(i) In the cases of 60 members, at the par values as specified
in the ‘‘Schedule of Par Vaiues”’, published by the International
Monetary Fund;

(ii) In the cases of the remaining 34 members [Algeria, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Cameroon, Centrai African Republic, Chad,
Chile, China, Colombia, Congo (Brazzaville), Democratic Republic of Congo, Dahomey, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Korea, Laos,
Malagasy Republic, Mali, Mauritania, Nepal, Niger, Paraguay,
Peru, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda,
Upper Volta, Viet-Nam and Yugoslavia], at the rates used by
such members in making payments of subscriptions to the
Association.

NOTE B

Pursuant to Article IV, Section 1 (a), these amounts may be used
by the Association for administrative expenses incurred by the
Association in the territories of any Part Il member whose currency is involved and, insofar as consistent with sound monetary
policies, in payment for goods and services produced in the territories of such member and required for projects financed by the
Association and located in such territories; and in addition when
and to the extent justified by the economic and financial situation of the member concerned as determined by agreement
between the member and the Association, such currency shall be
freely convertible or otherwise usable for projects financed by the
Association and located outside the territories of the member,

NOTE C

Under Articie 1V, Section 2, each member is required, if the par
value of its currency is reduced or the foreign exchange value ofits
currency has in the opinion of the Association depreciated to a
significant extent within that member's territories, to maintain the
value of the Association's holdings of its ninety percent currency,
including the principal amount of any notes substituted therefor,
and the Association is required if the par value of the member's
currency is increased, or the foreign exchange value of the member’s currency has in the opinion of the Association appreciated to
a significant extent within that member’s territories, to return to
the member the increase in the value of such ninety percent currency held by the Association; provided, however, that the foregoing shall apply only so long as and to the extent that such currency shall not have been initially disbursed or exchanged for the
currency of another member.

Supplementary resources of the Association have, by agreement,
the same respective rights and obligations as to maintenance of
value as are set forth in Article IV, Section 2, of the Articles of the
Association.

The equivalent of $240,000 is due from one member in order to
maintain the value of the Association's holdings of its ninety percent currency as required under Article IV, Section 2.

NOTE D
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has
authorized the transfer, by way of grant, to the Association of
$50,000,000 from the net income of the Bank for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1964. Of this amount, $10,400,000 has been received as of June 30, 1965.

NOTE E

The principal disbursed and outstanding on development credits
and the accrued service charge are expressed in terms of United
States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on January 1,
1960 and the equivalent is payable by the borrowers in currencies
which the Association determines to be freely convertible or freely
exchangeable by the Association for currencies of other members
of the Association, except that such amount would be reduced if
(a) there is a uniform proportionate reduction in the par values of
the currencies of all members of the International Monetary Fund
or (b) the Association so decides because of a substantial reduction in the value of one or more major currencies of members. The
foregoing does not apply to a credit of $9,000,000 which is expressed and is repayable in legal tender dollars.

NOTE F
Subscriptions and supplementary resources are expressed in
terms of United States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect
on January 1, 1960.

NOTE G
This portion of the subscriptions of members, being that of
Belgium and Luxembourg, is due in three equal instalments on
or before November 8, in each of the years 1965, 1966 and 1967,
and is payable in gold or freely convertible currency.

NOTE H
These supplementary resources are to be paid by Part | members
in freely convertible currencies in three equal instalments on or
before November 8, in each of the years 1965, 1966 and 1967.
tn July, South Africa agreed to make a contribution of $3,990,000
on the same basis. In addition, in July 1965, Sweden paid to the
Association a further contribution equivalent to $3,000,000.

GENERAL
The Board of Governors has approved the applications for membership from the following countries:

Country

Subscription Date to Accept
Guinea $1.01 million September 30, 1965
Malawi $ .76 million September 15, 1965
Trinidad and Tobago $1.35 million September 15, 1965
Zambia $2.69 million November 17, 1965

Malawi made partial payment on account of its subscription prior
to June 30, 1965 and in July paid the balance due and became a
member on July 19, 1965.

PART TWO

Trends and Outlook in Development Finance

he year 1964 was a good one for the world economy.

World industrial output rose by 7%, compared with the
postwar average of 5%. The value of recorded international trade increased by 12%, as compared with 9% in
1963 and an average of 7% between 1950 and 1962.

This acceleration reflected primarily an upswing in the
economic activity of major industrial countries. The United
States, in the fourth year of continuous prosperity, increased total output as much as 5%. In the United Kingdom, output rose by over 5.5%—the highest rate on record
in the postwar period. The long sustained expansion in
the industrialized Western European countries continued
in 1964 without interruption and their aggregate output
showed an increase of more than 5%. The Japanese growth
rate of some 10% indicated that the expansionary forces
of the last decade still retained much of their strength
in 1964.

The outlook for 1965 in the major industria! countries
as a whole seems fairly favorable. The domestic situation
of the U. S. so far in the current year shows continued
expansion, with price stability, and the externa! payments
position shows distinct improvement. In the United Kingdom, there is evident determination to take any further
measures that may become necessary to restore external
equilibrium. In some industrial countries of Europe and in
Japan, while industrial production leveled off toward the
end of 1964 and early in 1965, there is now some relaxation of the measures that were taken to contain the pressure on wages and prices and the pause in expansion is
expected to be temporary.

In the industrial countries with market economies, total
national product, which was around $920 billion in 1960,
rose to $1,100 billion (in 1960 prices) in 1964. These
countries buy about 75% of the exports of the developing
world and they supply almost ail the capital the develaping countries receive from abroad.

In the developing countries,’ output rose nearly as fast
as in the industrial countries, at a rate between 4% and
5% in 1963 and 1964; but the absolute figures were much
lower: total national product rose from around $170 billion in 1960 to some $200 billion in 1964. As a result of
rising demand in the industrial countries, the value of
exports of the developing countries rose by 9% in both
1963 and 1964, compared to an average of about 3.5%
between 1950 and 1962. The prices of their exports rose
after a decline which had lasted seven years, and since
there was little increase in the prices of their imports, their
terms of trade improved considerably.

The recovery in trade provided much needed help to the
developing countries by raising their capacity to import.
Their aggregate import volume had risen at a rate of only
2% per year in the period 1957-1962; and since population grew at 2.5%, imports per capita had in fact declined.
The upswing in commodity prices enabled the developing
countries to increase their import volume by 3% in 1963
and by 5% in 1964.

Some of the most important indexes of the year were,
however, less favorable to the developing countries, and
the situation has worsened in 1965.

As a result of rapid population growth, the developing
countries generally were unable to increase their per capita product faster than about 2%, even in the improved
conditions of the last two years. The highest rates of population increase have been in Asia and Latin America. In
Mexico and Venezuela, for instance, population has been
increasing by around 3.5% annually. The need for taking
effective measures to slow down the rate of population
increase in the developing countries has by now become
‘In this section the term “developing countries” refers to all countries
of Asia except Japan and Sino-Soviet countries, of Africa except South
Africa, of Latin America and of Southern Europe (Turkey, Yugoslavia,

Greece, Spain and Portugal). The group covers 1,500 million people or
70% of the population of the world outside the Sino-Soviet countries.widely accepted; but even successful measures taken today are unlikely to have any important impact on living
standards for a considerable time, and the actual carrying
out of these measures is still too slow.

In 1963, the prices of exports from the developing countries rose after a 7-year decline; but the prices of agricultural products started to weaken toward the end of 1964.
Although most mineral prices have continued strong, the
present outlook over the medium term (assuming there
is no sharp increase in international tensions) is that the
prices of primary products generally will tend to decline.
On this basis, the rate of growth in export earnings of the
developing countries is likely to return again to a rate of
3% or 4% a year, with a corresponding decline in their
ability to pay for a rising level of imports.

The capacity to pay for imports is an important constraint on the rate at which a country can grow. If the
future growth in external earnings of the developing countries is not rapid enough their capacity to import will be
heid down, unless there is an offsetting increase in the
capital made available to them. Here the record of the last
few years has not been very encouraging. Total private
long-term capital invested in the developing countries
reached a peak in 1957 at $3.4 billion and has since remained below this point. The disbursements of the total
net official flow of long-term financial resources from the
developed countries (outside the Sino-Soviet area), after
a sharp rise at the end of the 1950's and the beginning
of the 1960's, in 1964 were slightly below the 1961 figure.
Net disbursements by international institutions, however,
rose both in 1963 and 1964. An increase is also believed
to have taken place in Sino-Soviet disbursements, as well
as in exporter credits from all countries, in 1964. The total
net flow of finance (private, official bilateral and funds
made available to multilateral institutions) in 1964 was
about $9.5 billion. At the same time, payments of interest,
dividends and profits by the developing countries to the
industrial ones rose sharply and were over 40% of the
total net capital flows.

The level of disbursements of foreign assistance in any
given period reflects to a considerable extent the commitment decisions undertaken several years before, particularly insofar as project assistance is concerned. Thus a
rising level of commitments would indicate an increasing
flow of foreign assistance in the future. In fact, while commitments by the World Bank group and other international
development institutions are going up, there is no indication that the trend of over-all commitments for official bilateral aid is rising substantially at the present time.

There is, however, still an increasing need of developing
countries for development finance. Analyses by the Bank
staff have shown that in a few countries the need for official foreign assistance may decline over the next several
years as a result of the progress they have already
achieved in raising their domestic savings and in improv
ing their export earnings. But these cases are still exceptions. For the large majority of developing countries, even
assuming improved domestic resource mobilization, external capital requirements are likely to rise at least through
1969. There is no doubt that much more can and should
be done in many of the developing countries to cut down
on waste, to make better use of the resources available,
to encourage private enterprise and public efficiency, and
to slow down the rapid growth in population. These are
objectives the World Bank group and other international
development agencies are conscious of and, within their
abilities, are working toward.

But it is also true that with the accumulation of experience and with the spread of education, training and
research, the ability of the developing countries to make
good use of external finance is expected to rise faster
than the amount of finance available to them on conditions that do not put them in peril of over-indebtedness.

The opportunity to achieve more rapid advance by the
developing countries is growing; whatis not clear is whether
this opportunity will be fully exploited by the developing
countries and whether the developed countries will provide the full measure of help that would make it possible
for them to do so.

Major Trends in the
Developing Countries

Global figures obviously are very rough—especially for
the developing countries where statistics are still often
inadequate; and the estimated growth rate of 4% to 5%
in the output of the underdeveloped countries in 1964
further conceals wide variations among these countries.

Acceleration of growth, nevertheless, appears to have
been quite widespread. Countries that have been showing
particularly good growth during the last few years include
the Republic of China and Thailand in Asia; Tunisia and
Libya in Africa; Israel and Iraq in the Middle East; Greece,
Spain and Yugoslavia in Southern Europe; and Mexico,
Peru and Venezuela in Latin America. Growth rates, on
the other hand, have been very low in a number of developing countries inciuding Indonesia, Ceylon, Tanzania,
Togo, Mali and Haiti.

Industry has been the most dynamic sector in the underdeveloped countries; industrial output grew by 7% in both
1963 and 1964. In almost all cases, as might be expected,
the increase in industry has been significantly faster than
the growth of total product. Within the industrial sector,
mining and electric power supply have tended to achieve
the fastest growth. Production of minerals expanded very
rapidly until temporary capacity limitations were encountered in 1963 and 1964. In response to the improved
demand in world markets, prices rose. The fastest and,
over the longer run, steadiest increase has been in petro
5354

leum, in high demand not only because of the general rise
in world economic activity, but also because of its displacement of other fuels.

Manufacturing grew at an annual rate of some 7% in
both 1963 and 1964 (see Table 1). In some countries
the increase in industrial production was concentrated in
heavy industry, but in others the main emphasis, which
was economically justifiable, was on the expansion of
light industries. In both, development has been oriented
toward substitution for imported manufactures, exports
accounting for only a small part of production. The share
of manufactures in the total exports of the developing
countries, including exports to other developing countries,
is still only about 10%. While learning to produce and sell
manufactures abroad is very difficult, countries like Yugoslavia, Israel, Mexico, and the Republic of China have
already demonstrated the benefits for growth at home
that such exports can provide.

In several countries, expansion of manufacturing was
seriously hampered by shortages of raw materials and
spare parts needed from abroad which could not be imported because of a shortage of foreign exchange. While
this was due in some cases to over-emphasis on importsubstitution as compared to export industries, or overallocation of foreign exchange to new projects as against
the import needs of existing industries, the net result was
the same—factories operating below capacity or unable
to expand. In 1964, in some countries, improved balance
of payments earnings and foreign assistance enabled some
liberalization of the imports of raw materials and, as in
Pakistan, factories were able to raise output quickly. Conscious of the need to accelerate industrialization and to
secure the adoption of effective policies in this direction
in the developing countries, the World Bank group has
been trying to increase its lending operations in this field
and to expand its assistance in project identification. These

measures are described in other sections of this report.

In contrast to industrial output, agricultural production
has been growing at an average rate of only 2.5% a year
over the past decade. The underdeveloped countries as a
whole are not growing enough food to keep pace with
increasing population and rising consumption standards.
In 1963, they spent more than $4 billion on imports of
food, and received ancther $1 billion worth under U. S.
Public Law 480. Food imports by the developing countries
in 1964 were at least as large as in 1963.

The expansion of food production for domestic consumption is hampered by a variety of structural difficulties, economic and social.

To grow more and better food is in many respects the
most difficult part of development. It is in the traditional
farming sector where the inflexibility of custom, the rigidity of structure, the narrowness of vision, the age-old land
tenure systems—singly or in combination—hold back advance. Yet because a farmer’s relationship to land involves
one of the most deep-seated of all human emotions and
because it is often the central focus of family and social
structure, change is not easy and cannot be brought about
by bull-dozer. Change and the pressure for change are
occurring at a different pace in different countries. Institutions like the Bank can help, and the Bank group is
expanding its help, through finance of farming schemes
and the provision of technical assistance together with
FAO, but all this is peripheral—the main job has to be and
can only be done by each people for itself.

Total output and income in most countries at their present stage of development increase slowly because agricultural output and income increase slowly—hampered in
some cases by mistaken government policies. The inadequate increase limits the rate at which inputs of agricultural raw materials can be fed to the industrial sector; it
also limits the rate at which labor force can be released
for absorption in non-agricultural activities, since growth
of agricultural incomes plays a major role in determining
the expansion of the internal market for goods and services.

The export sector, which is usually the most progressive
part of agriculture in the developing countries, can, however, scarcely be blamed for the lag in agricultural growth.
In the various agricultural export commodities growth has
tended to be more rapid than the growth of demand in
the industrialized countries. Consequently, the developing
countries suffered from a sustained decline in the prices
of their agricultural exports during 1957-1962.

EXPORTS AND IMPORTS

Most of the exports of the developing countries are still
primary commodities; over the long run, the demand for
these commodities, both agricultural and mineral products, rises relatively slowly, and from year to year is subject to sharp fluctuations. Experience since 1957 has been
significant in illustrating the ability of the developing coun-tries as a whole to increase production for export, the relatively slower increase of demand for their products, and
the great difficulty they experience in shifting to products,
such as manufactures, for which demand is more elastic.

The annual increase in the volume of exports for the
developing countries as a whole was around 5% in the
period 1957-62, somewhat higher than the rate of increase
in total gross national product. But during that time, prices
fell, and export earnings increased by not more than 3%.

One of the most severely affected commodities was coffee, the total export earnings of which declined in that
period by one quarter (or by around $600 million a year),
in spite of an increase of one quarter in volume of exports.
In cocoa, the rise in production has been such that cocoa
prices have been under almost continuous pressure since
1959 and by June 1965 were under 50% of the 1955-57
average. Sugar prices, after a spectacular rise in 1963-64,
due to short crops, have suffered an equally spectacular
fall since.

In 1963 and 1964, export earnings of the developing
countries, the largest single source of foreign exchange,
rose by 9% in each year, due to an increase in both volume
and prices. The greatest increases in the value of exports
were 15% and 18%, in Africa and the Middle East respectively. Export earnings in Latin America rose by 9%. The
smallest increase, around 2%, was in Southeast Asia.

Average price movements of export commodities in the
last two years have been heavily affected by the sharp

rise and fall of sugar prices. Excluding sugar, average commodity prices increased by 2.5% in the five quarters beginning October 1962, and by 5% in 1964, according to the
Bank’s price index for primary products produced by low
and medium-income countries. Including sugar, prices increased by 12% from 1962 to 1963, decreased slightly
in 1964 and dropped 6% in the first half of 1965.2

In general, in 1963 and 1964 prices of agricultural commodity exports went up, and then in the first half of 1965
declined again. The price increase in the last two years
included a variety of commodities, including coffee, wool
and such non-ferrous metals as copper. Together with
cocoa, coffee and oilseeds declined in price in the first
half of 1965, while the price of copper continued to rise.
The price recovery in 1963 and 1964 was due to the booming demand in the industrial countries combined with a
slower growth in supplies of commodities subsequent to
the slump in former years. In some commodities, such as
coffee, agreements by the producer countries resulted in
a more controlled supply.

As prices went up, however, commodity production
tended to expand and to depress prices again. The recent
Crop in agricultural export prices and the present primary
commodity price outlook strongly suggest that the considerable increase in export earnings of the developing

countries in the last two years may prove to be only temporary. Even with continued expansion in the industrial
countries, the ability of the developing countries to increase production at a rate which is faster than demand
grows for most of their usual export commodities tends
to result in a downward pressure on their export prices.

While some developing countries have good prospects
for an increase in their agricultural or mining export earnings, many of the others to increase their export earnings
have to diversify their exports, especially to manufactures.
Although some of them, chiefly in the intermediate or industrializing stage of growth, have shown a marked ability
to move in this direction, most developing countries cannot diversify effectively unless far-reaching economic and
social changes can be induced; such changes take time.

The Bank has been concerned for a long time with the
problems of fluctuations and sluggish growth of external
earnings of developing countries. These two subjects were
in the forefront of the deliberations of tne United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development last year. At the
request of the Conference, the Bank is currently examining the feasibility of establishing a mechanism which would
assist countries hurt by shortfalls of external earnings
below reasonable expectations to avoid disruption of their
development programs. It is generally accepted that, if
development programs are to be executed as planned,
supplementary assistance in some form will be needed in
many cases to offset the effects of unfavorable developments in external trade.

The total imports of goods by the developing countries
increased from 1957 to 1962 at an annual rate of 2% at
constant prices, and about 1% at current prices. The slow
growth of imports was the net result of several factors.
Perhaps the single most important one has been the availability of foreign exchange. Thus in 1963 and 1964 the
substantial increase in export earnings enabled the developing countries to increase their imports rapidly as well
as partly to rebuild depleted foreign exchange reserves.
In those years, imports of goods into the developing countries as a group increased at an average rate of 4% in
constant prices, and of 5% in current prices. Imports, like
exports, increased at a relatively high rate in the Middle
East and Africa and at a much lower rate in South and
Southeast Asia and Latin America.

The increase in investment in manufacturing, which has
a high import component, has tended to raise import requirements. In some countries, the inability to raise food
production on a sufficient scale has necessitated increases
in essential food imports. On the other hand, other developing countries were able to substitute some domestic
production for imports. This factor was particularly significant in Latin America. Recently, import substitution
has played an increasingly important role in India and
Pakistan. Some of the import substitution industries are
economically viabie in the long run, but many can survive

only as long as there are severe foreign exchange shortages and resulting balance of payments restrictions or
extremely high protective duties.

CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE

The increase in export earnings of the developing countries in 1963 and 1964 somewhat exceeded the rise in
imports, so that the deficit on balance of payments current account decreased. The current account deficit of the
developing countries as a whole, which was estimated at
$4.9 billion in 1962, was $3.7 billion in 1963 and $4.5
billion in 19649.

These figures include the major oil exporters (Saudi
Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Netherlands Antilles,
Venezuela) some of which run a considerable surplus
which is not available to the other developing countries.
The estimates of the total current deficit of the developing
countries, excluding the major oil producers, were: 1962,
$6.3 billion; 1963, $5.3 billion; and 1964, $5.9 billion.4

These sets of estimates can be compared with those for
current payments for investment service (interest, dividends and profits but excluding amortization) by the developing countries as a whole. These amounted to $3.5
billion in 1963. Income payments due from the developing countries to the U. S., which in 1963 accounted for
70% of their total, have shown an increase of $400 million,
from $2.3 billion in 1963 to $2.7 billion in 1964. Increases
also are indicated for other industrial countries. The total
payments for investment service by the developing countries amounted to no less than $4 billion in 1964. The
increase in investment income payments was mostly due
to the maturing of the results of private investments in
recent years, for example the start of large-scale production of petroleum in North Africa.

INVESTMENT AND SAVINGS

The fevel and composition of investment, of course, are
important determinants of growth. While the productivity
of investment shows significant differences among countries, the more rapidly growing economies have generally
shown higher ratios of investment to total output. Thus,
in israel, the Republic of China and Yugoslavia, gross
investment over the 1957-1962 period amounted to some
30% of gross national product. The ratio was 17% in Latin
America and less than 13% in most countries of Asia and
Africa. It should be stressed, however, that some countries which have had low investment rates—India, Pakistan
and a number of African countries, for instance—have
been raising them in recent years.

In most developing countries, 75% or more of gross
investments are financed by domestic savings. Consequently, the greater the success in mobilizing such sav3 IME estimates.

animated from IMF data and from World Bank and IMF Direction of
rade.ings, the higher the rate of investment can be pushed.

A rise in savings rates often requires a substantial increase of public savings through higher taxes or cuts in
expenditure. This is painful, especially in those countries
where much of the population is outside the monetized
sector, and so have limited tax-paying capacity. Thus the
actual tax burden on the monetized economy is heavier
than indicated by the ratio of total tax revenue to total
income. The alternative of resorting to inflationary financing to try to obtain resources temporarily for development
is an unsatisfactory and frequently self-defeating substitute for greater fiscal effort.

Rates of savings show great variation among countries,
rarely corresponding to differences in absolute levels of
income. Some countries, such as Uganda, Peru, Colombia
and Malaysia, have attained gross savings rates as high
as 20% of gross national product. In others, such as the
Sudan, Chile, the Philippines and Pakistan, rates of gross
savings have been as low as 10% or less. In many countries, the rates of savings have been increasing; this is
true even in low income countries, such as Pakistan, the
Philippines and Kenya. Assuming effective use of available
investment funds, the rate of increase in savings is clearly
one of the best indicators of the development effort being
made by a country.

External Finance for Development

Trends in the world economy underline the need for
further measures to accelerate growth in the developing
countries, both through appropriate action and policies
of these countries themselves and through the help of the
developed countries. While adequate supply and effective
use of domestic and externally provided capital is only
one of the problems of development, it is one of the most
important and its urgency has been greatly heightened
by the increasing burden of debt servicing.

The need to replenish IDA resources in 1966 will focus
attention on questions of debt burdens and of the volume
and terms of future development finance. It offers an
appropriate occasion to reappraise what is being done in
development finance and affords an opportunity to adapt
government policies to present conditions.

EXTERNAL INDEBTEDNESS
OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

developing world (excluding the 1,000 million people in
the Sino-Soviet countries), outstanding public and publicly
guaranteed debt with a maturity of one year or more rose
from $18 billion at the end of 1962 to $21 billion at the
end of 1963, and preliminary estimates give a total of
$25 billion for 1964. Over the last two years, the annual
rate of growth in debt was about 17%, compared to 15%
between 1955 and 1962. (The impact of this continuous
increase in debt on debt service is discussed below.)

Table Il shows the differing rates at which debt has
grown in different areas. After rapid growth in the late
1950s and early 1960s, the accumulation of indebtedness
during the past two years in Latin America has shown a
somewhat slower pace. In contrast, marked acceleration
was experienced in the African and Asian countries as
well as in southern Europe.

(a) End of year. Figures in parentheses are crude estimates.

For the developing countries as a whole, it is estimated
that outstanding public and publicly-guaranteed indebtedness with a maturity of one year and over may have
amounted to $9 billion in 1955, $28 billion in 1963 and

5758

as much as $33 billion at the end of 1964. This is, however, not an all-inclusive estimate. The debt of private
parties not guaranteed by governments in developing
countries is excluded, and so are obligations arising from
commercial arrears. There is also the need to provide foreign exchange for the remittance of profits, dividends,
managerial services, etc., which are associated with foreign direct investment. Such remittances must be allowed
by governments, whether they have formally committed
themselves to this or not, if the productive help of foreign
direct investment is to be secured and maintained.

The growth in debt was accompanied by a rise in debt
service payments (amortization and interest). For the
group of 37 countries mentioned above, debt service payments on public and publicly-guaranteed debt with a maturity of one year and over rose from $2.0 billion in 1962
and $2.3 billion in 1963 to an estimated level of $2.5 billion in 1964. While it appears that the rate of growth in
debt service payments of those countries has slackened
in the past two years (see Table IV), the volume of such
payments is now almost four times what it was in the mid1950s, and it continues to rise.

For the developing countries as a whole, total service
payments on public and publicly-guaranteed debt with a
maturity of one year and over are estimated at about $3.5
billion in 1964. A large proportion of this outstanding debt
consists of medium and short-term maturities. If allowance is made for the liquidation of commercial arrears
and similar short-term obligations, aggregate debt service
payments may easily have amounted, in 1964, to well over
$4 billion.

These are very large numbers. In the mid-1950s, public
debt service absorbed less than 4% of export earnings of
developing countries. In 1964, this proportion had risen
to 12%. (For a number of debtors, the ratio of public debt
service to exports is substantially higher than this average
—in some cases, twice as high.) As a consequence, an
increasing proportion of official gross capital inflow is being
offset by service on the existing debt.

The fixed nature of these obligations means that payments in foreign exchange must continue to be made in

those years in which—for one reason or another, but commonly because of a shortfall of export earnings—the foreign exchange position is tight. Thus a country may be
faced with acute foreign exchange shortage primarily because of an unfavorable debt structure. This calls both
for a continuing review of existing debt and careful consideration as to how it should be handied. For the immediate future, the solution in exceptional cases may lie in
debt rescheduling or, in others, it may require a shift in
the flow of new lending toward longer grace and amortization periods; in some cases, a combination of both will be
necessary.

Aside from the short-term problem of an awkward debt
structure, for the longer term it is the possibility of continuing increase in external debt—~and in service payments
—which causes most concern for many a country. There
is commonly a phase in the development process in which
a country’s external borrowing not only bridges the gap
between domestic savings and investment, but also to a
large extent finances amortization and interest charges
on external debt previously incurred. This phase involves
a cumulation of external debt at a pace principally determined by the magnitude of the gap between domestic
savings and investments, the rate of economic growth and
savings, the efficiency with which investment resources
are deployed, and the rate of interest on borrowed capital.
Arapid mounting of debt in this phase need not be worrying, provided that there is a good prospect that the gap
between savings and investment will be closed before the
payments on accumulated debt reach intolerable proportions. For a large number of developing countries, however, the point in time when this gap will be closed appears
still to be quite distant.

Different developing countries face different problems
related to their international indebtedness, and different
solutions have to be adapted in extending long-term development capital to them. Liquidity crises can be avoided
or their effects mitigated by a suitable structure of debt,
with a higher proportion of longer maturities; the long-run
piling up of debt and debt service payments can be slowed
by a reduction in the rate of interest and by a lengthening
of maturities.

Part of the indebtedness problem arises from unwise
borrowing and unwise lending. The trouble arises from
high-pressure salesmanship on the one side, often facilitated by abuse of export credit insurance, and the desire,
on the other side, to avoid all the hard work of preparing
and negotiating help for projects. in these cases, large
amounts of short and medium-term indebtedness are
taken on, although foreign exchange earnings are not
likely to increase fast enough to meet quickly maturing
repayments. Such short and medium-term money is often
used to finance slow-yielding projects and in too many
cases projects which wil! never yield an economic return at all.Capital is vital, but equally important is effective use of
capital. While the developing countries have no monopoly
on bad investment, prestige projects, excessive defense
expenditure, and other forms of waste, continued improvement in how they handle their investments is necessary
simply because they have so little capital available.

FLOWS OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES
TO THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

While the data are still incomplete, the evidence so far
available indicates that financial assistance from developed countries (including the Sino-Soviet couniries) to
developing countries directly and to international development institutions, after a substantial rise in the latter part
of the 1950's, has increased little over the past four years.
The amount of assistance from these countries, net of
capital repayments, has now reached $9.5 billion a years;
it has come mostly from public sources.

By far the largest part of the total originates in the IDA
Part | countries, that is the capital-contributing member
countries of the International Development Association
(see Table V). The total net flow of funds (including private
and official bilateral as well as capital made available to
multilateral institutions) to the developing countries from
the IDA Part! countries amounted to $8.9 billion in 1961,
$8.3 billion in 1962 and 1963, and $9 billion in 1964.
About 85% of the total has originated in four countries:
the United States (55%), France (15%), the United Kingdom (9%) and Germany (8%).

Assistance from international development institutions,
including the World Bank group, has increased steadily,
from $250 million in 1961 to around $800 million in 1964;
and commitments indicate that these figures will continue to rise.

Aid from the Sino-Soviet countries is now around 5% of
the whole. Their net disbursements are estimated to have
increased from $300 million in 1961 to $400 million in
1962, $425 million in 1963, and perhaps around $500
million in 1964. Disbursements have grown steadily, but
commitments show large fluctuations, rising in the years
from 1958 to 1960, and then declining to 1963. In 1964,
commitments by the Sino-Soviet countries increased fivefold over the previous year, and reached a peak level of
$1.5 billion. The Soviet Union has been the largest creditor
of the group; butits share has diminished from some 85%
in 1959 to approximately 60% in 1964. The remainder
originated about equally in the eastern European countries and in mainland China.

¢ Sizable differences exist between the figures for the developing countries’ balance of payments deficits on current account (see p. 56) and
the total capital movements which finance them. The differences are
largely due to omissions, errors and inconsistencies in reporting, and to
the fact that some of the developing countries {particularly oil producers)
were adding about $1 billion to reserves in 1963/1964. The World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are engaged in a cooperative effort to make
the reporting of the data more complete and more uniform.

OFFICIAL FLOWS

The official bilateral financial flows from the developed
world outside the Sino-Soviet countries to the developing
countries totaled about $6 billion both in 1963 and 1964.
While the figures were the same in these two years, their
composition changed somewhat: U. S. disbursements declined from $3.8 billion in 1963 to $3.5 billion in 1964,
while those of the U. K. and Germany increased. Disbursements by France remained on the level of the previous
year.

Since U.S. aid commitments increased considerably in
1964, disbursements in the next years may be expected
to rise. Canada and the Netherlands also increased their
commitments. The official aid commitments of some countries, however, have declined.

PRIVATE FLOWS

Net flows of private capital to the developing countries
totaled $2.9 billion in 1964, a considerable increase over
the level of the two previous years, and about $200 million
above the average recorded for the period 1956-1961.
The 1964 total was composed of 70% direct investments,
including reinvested profits, and 30% tong-term loans and
export credits for five years or more, mostly guaranteed by
official institutions; and both these components were
greater than in 1963. Direct investment was attracted
especially to petroleum production and distribution. The
largest part of direct investment was made in LatinAmerica,
while the share of Africa and Asia was very small.

In addition to the private capital flows stated above, private commercial credit for periods of less than 5 years,
guaranteed by governmental institutions, amounted to an
average of $225 million in 1962 and 1963 and an estimated $350 million in 1964. No satisfactory estimates
are available of the amount of unguaranteed private commercial credit.

In February 1965, the U. S. Administration, concerned
over the increase in the over-all balance of payments deficit, took several measures to restrict private capital outflows. Banks and other financial institutions were asked
to limit their foreign investments and loans so that the
outstanding amount of private foreign loans should not
increase during 1965 by more than 5%. As by February
1965 in some cases the outstanding credits had already
reached 105% or more, a cutback for some institutions
became necessary. Within this ceiling, priority was to be
given to credits directly financing exports from the U. S.
and then to credits in the less developed countries. Nonbank corporations were also asked to exercise restraint
on their investments in other industrial countries and to
report the balance of payments effect of their operations
with other countries. Direct investments in developing
countries were specifically excluded from this request. In
addition, the Administration made the Interest Equalization Tax, which increases the cost of certain foreign borrowing in the United States, applicable to commercial bank
loans to foreigners with maturities of one year or more.
The Administration also requested Congress to extend the
duration of the Interest Equalization Tax and to expand
the coverage of the tax to include non-bank credit of one
to three years maturity.

In April 1965, the U. K. Government also announced
measures to reduce private capital outflow, by the equivalent of $280 million annually, to help correct a balance of
payments deficit. To that end, exchange allocations for
direct investments outside the sterling area were to be
made on a stricter basis, taking into account the expected
exchange income. In addition, one of the effects of changes
in the method of taxing company profits was that in general the tax treatment of income from foreign investments
would be less favorable than before.

The European Economic Community countries as a group
had a net inflow of capital, and some of them, notably
Germany, were concerned over the inflationary impacts of
such inflows. The German authorities took fiscal and other
measures to encourage private investments abroad, especially in the developing countries. A recovery in such investment was registered in 1964.

TERMS OF OFFICIAL AID

The harder the terms of financial assistance, the greater
will be the return flow of amortization and interest from
the developing countries. The greater the return flow, the
larger the gross amount of aid has to be to make available
a given net amount of capital. The hardness or softness
of terms is, therefore, of as great importance to the developing countries as the amount of assistance. Two main
factors determine the hardness or softness of aid: (a) the
share of grants in the total flows; (b) the structure of interest rates and the length of grace and amortization periods.

The share of grants in bilateral aid commitments has
been gradually declining in recent years. While in 1962,
grants and grant-like contributions equaled 60% of aid
commitments, in 1963 the share declined to 56%, and in
1964 to 54%. The U. S. reduced its share of grants from
62% of aid commitments in 1963 to 56% in 1964, and
France, the second largest extender of grants, from 80%
to 76%. The U. K. also reduced the share of grants in its
commitments for 1964. The proportion of grants in commitments of Germany and the Netherlands increased in
1964; but these countries accounted for a relatively small
share in the total flows.

On the other hand, the over-all terms of bilateral official
lending have been improving, with a lengthening of the
amortization period and a small lowering of interest rates.
The average maturity of loan commitments made in 1964
was 27.6 years, compared with 24.6 years in 1963 and
23.9 years in 1962.

The average interest rate for official bilateral commitments made in 1964 was 3.1% compared with 3.4% in
1963 and 3.6% in 1962. This was the net result of reductions in interest rates charged by some countries, which
were partially compensated for by an increase in rates
on U.S. commitments; U.S. rates, however, were still below
the average.

The trends indicated above are on a commitments basis,
and will be reflected only in future disbursements. For
disbursements made in recent years, the average terms
for lending have remained about the same.

The improvement in the terms of lending reflects the
growing concern over the debt service burden of the developing countries. In June 1965 the British Government announced that it will make interest-free loans to selected
developing countries (based on, in particular, the per
capita income of the recipient country and its present
debt burden), thus taking a major step in alleviating thefuture burden of indebtedness on these countries. Canada
also has considerably improved its terms by inaugurating
a new program of lending on terms equivalent to the present IDA terms.

Loans given by the Soviet Union have been made at low
interest rates, usually about 2.5%, but the amortization
period has been relatively short, about 12 years on the
average. Loans from other eastern European countries
have been given on harder terms, carrying interest rates
of up to 5% and amortization periods of four to eight years.

INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS

While the major share of external finance to developing
countries has been through official bilateral channels or
in the form of direct investment and loans, a part of such
financing came through international capital markets.
These markets have been an important source of financing
for international development institutions, including the
World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank;
official bodies and private corporations in a number of
developing countries have also been able to sell bonds in
the private markets. These markets should furnish a
growing amount of the needed capital funds of the developing countries.

The total amount of new issues (including private ones)
sold by the developing countries in foreign capital markets
was some $350 million in 1964, compared to $200 million
in 1963. In addition, international institutions soid bonds
amounting to some $180 million in 1964, compared to only
$50 miilion in the previous year.

Changes in the capital markets were mainly due to the
measures taken by the U.S. and the U.K. to protect their
balance of payments and by the EEC countries to secure
domestic stability. The U.S. Interest Equalization Tax on
purchases of certain foreign securities raises the actual
interest costs to the foreign borrowers concerned by about
1%. (The tax became effective as of the date of its proposal, July 1963.) Securities issued by the developing
countries and international organizations of which the
United States is a member (including the World Bank),
are exempt and new issues of Canadian securities were
exempted by Executive Order. A 1965 Executive Order
exempted from the tax new issues of debt securities payable in dollars issued or guaranteed by the Government of
Japan up to an annual amount of $100 million.

The exemption from the tax of issues by developing
countries resulted in an increase of such issues in the
U.S. market. The sales of new bonds publicly issued by the
developing countries almost doubled from $97 million in
1963 to some $180 million in 1964. In 1965, through the
end of June, some $55 million more was borrowed by
developing countries. The main borrowers were Israel,
Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines and Venezuela. The
World Bank also sold an issue of $200 million early in 1965.

London has continued its traditional role as an important
capital market; but Jamaica was the only developing
country which made a direct issue in the London market
during 1964 and again in 1965, borrowing around $9
million each time.

Foreign issues have increased rapidly in Germany, but
the developing countries did not place any issues there.
The value of foreign bond issues in Germany increased to
$225 million in 1964, compared to only $40 million in
1963 and $25 million in 1962. The borrowers were governments and municipalities in Japan and the Scandinavian
countries, EEC financial bodies and the Inter-American
Development Bank. In March 1965, the World Bank also
made an issue in Germany in Deutsche Marks of anamount
equivalent to $62.5 million.

While Switzerland has been a well-established market
for foreign issues, the volume of such issues contracted
considerably in 1964. In effect. from September 1964
until March 1965 almost no foreign issues were made on
the Swiss market. In April 1965, the World Bank made an
issue equivalent to $14 million in Swiss francs.

The French capital market was, for many years, closed
to borrowers from outside the Franc Zone. This policy was
changed in November 1963, when the French authorities
announced their intention to re-open the market for foreign
borrowing. Under the new policy, an issue of $30 million
by the European Coal and Steel Community was placed
in the French Market in 1964, following a similar issue of
$12 million by the European Investment Bank in 1963.
These international institutions have been the only borrowers from outside the Franc Zone in the French capital
market in recent years.

The Netherlands was an active market for foreign issues,
especially in 1961 and 1962. Due to balance of payments
difficulties, no foreign issues were made in 1963. In 1964,
foreign issues of an amount equivalent to $15 million
were made by the European Investment Bank and the
European Coal and Steel Community.

Thus, as an outcome of the changes during 1964 increased recourse was had to European capital markets.
Nevertheless, the United States still accounted for more
than half of the amount of all international issues, including those of international institutions, and was almost the
only market for issues of the developing countries.

The general trend of interest rates, affecting domestic
as weil as foreign issues, has been upward in 1964. The
trend was most noticeable in discount and short-term
lending rates, which were raised in the U.K. and in the
United States primarily to curb capital outflows, and in a
number of other countries, including Germany, to contain
inflationary dangers. Long-term interest rates also rose in
most capital markets (see Chart 2), with the important
exception of the U.S. in which long-term rates were on the
whole stable. These high interest rates, the substantial
costs of issue in European markets (which reflect the still

inadequate development of the capital market institutions
and habits of investors), and the still unestablished private
capital market credit of most of the less developed countries, limit the amount of foreign borrowing presently
feasible for the developing countries.

Future Needs

While the amount of external finance has grown little in
recent years after a substantial rise in the 1950's, the
capability of the developing countries to make productive
use of resources has increased considerably. A preliminary
Bank inquiry, carried out country by country and based on
the judgment and experience of the Bank’s country specialists and area economists, suggests that the developing
countries could effectively use, on the average over the
next five years, some $3 billion to $4 billion more of
external capital per year than has been provided in the
recent past.

An important source of funds, of course, is private
capital, which may have a productive or catalytic effect
considerably greater than its volume would indicate. In
some instances, the exports generated by such investments may actually result in foreign exchange earnings
which considerably surpass the requirements for service
on the investments. The Worid Bank group and other
international organizations, as well as development finance

companies within the developing countries themselves,
are making strenuous efforts to encourage and enlarge
the flow of private capital into the less developed countries.
There is no doubt that this flow can be expected to increase
above the levels recorded in the recent past, thereby
accelerating the pace of development and relieving the
pressure on public funds. For the present, however, it
must be recognized that for some time to come the increasing needs of the less developed countries for external
capital will probably have to be covered mainly by official
flows originating in the developed countries and channeled
through bilateral agencies or international financial institutions. Meanwhile, the official flows, through their help in
creating stronger economic structures in the developing
countries, both widen the outlets for private investment
and multiply the productive contribution it can make.

The question of the future level of development finance
is intimately related to the question of terms on which
finance is provided. At the present time a substantial
proportion of capital flows is in the form of grants. As
indicated earlier, grants from official sources in industrial
countries have declined slightly during the last three years,
and there is no indication at present that they will increase.
The harder the terms of lending, the larger are the amounts
of gross capital transfers needed over future years to
assure a given net transfer of resources. Meeting this
need through lending on hard terms would necessitate agross flow of lending of increasingly large magnitudes.

The question arises whether such large and increasing
amounts can be raised through foreign aid appropriations.
But more important, large reliance on lending on hard
terms would result in further sharp increases in external
indebtedness and in debt service obligations. For countries
where the dependence on foreign finance is moderate
and is expected to diminish in the foreseeable future,
where yields on investment and the marginal savings
ratios are satisfactory, and where export prospects are
favorable, exclusive reliance on hard lending terms is
justified. For developing countries, where dependence on
foreign finance is substantial and expected to last for a
very long period, where yields on investment and the
marginal savings ratios are relatively low, and where export
prospects are uncertain, low interest rates or long grace
and amortization periods are needed in varying degrees.
Countries with extremely low rates of savings and serious
institutional obstacles to raising them cannot sustain hard
terms even if their present indebtedness is low. Countries
where the debt service burden is already high and the
dependence on foreign resources is still large despite
rising savings, also need softening of terms.

The need for finance on concessionary terms stems
from the balance of payments position of a developing
country (which reflects its economic structure) and is
connected with its stage of development and paucity of
resources. This very fact emphasizes that the need that
such funds be used effectively is as great as in the case of
conventional loans. It is for this reason that the Bank’s
affiliate, the International Development Association (IDA),
offers concessionary financial terms but insists on standards of project preparation and evaluation that are as
exacting as those of the Bank itself. This is also the reason
for the so-called ‘two-step’ policy in IDA credits, whereby
the country gets the balance of payments benefits of IDA
terms but the project financed has to bear the discipline
of conventional terms in local currency when it is administratively feasible to do so. At the same time, the economy
aided is under regular economic review, which includes an
assessment of economic and financial performance. For
specific countries where a number of aid-giving countries
are involved in addition to the Bank group, consortia and
consultative groups provide an opportunity for the donor

countries to review development policies of the recipient
countries.

As stated earlier, there is room for the developing countries to improve the mobilization of domestic savings and
to make more effective the use of both internal and external
capital resources. There has been steady progress in this
in recent years. However, it must be recognized that there
is a scarcity of capital even in the industrial countries, that
their capital markets are often still underdeveloped, and
that there are competing investment outlets within these
economies for capital resources. Also, when the industrial
nations are called upon to extend assistance to other
countries for a prolonged period, their own governments
are likely to be closely questioned by their legislatures and
peoples on various aspects of such assistance. The most
careful husbanding and effective utilization of aid resources by each of the recipient countries is constantly
necessary, therefore, if they are to expect continued assistance, and on a larger scale. Performance, in terms of the
pursuit of sound economic and financial policies and
effective implementation of programs and projects, has
to stand up to close scrutiny.

If external financing is not extended in larger amounts,
the less developed countries will, of course, have to accommodate themselves to what is available, but some of the
consequences can be foreseen. A slackening in the rate
of investment activity may become unavoidable; the growth
rate may be reduced; low standards of living may rise even
more slowly than in the past, particularly in the face of
rising population; the pressure to resort to inflationary
financing in order to obtain domestic resources would
become greater, and even more intensive restrictions
would have to be placed on imports and foreign exchange
payments. These developments may well discourage the
flows of private capital and distort the pattern of investment.

In conclusion, both the problem of the terms at which
development finance is made available and the problem
of the volume of future flows of resources are key questions both developing and developed countries face today.
Closely related is the problem of improving the export
performance of the developing countries, both by changes
in their domestic policies and through improved access to
foreign markets.

63ANNEX

The information in this section describes Bank loans, IDA credits and
other activities of both institutions
during the fiscal year. Money amounts
are usually expressed in United States
dollar equivalents,

Bank loans to borrowers other than
member governments carry the guarantees of the governments concerned, and the participations of
financial institutions in loans made

during the year were all without
the Bank’s guarantee.

All IDA credits were made to the
governments concerned, on identical
terms: No principal repayments are
to be made for the first 10 years;
thereafter 1% per annum is repayable for the next 10 years and 3% per
annum is repayable for the final 30
years. The credits are free of interest,
but a service charge of %4 of 1% per

annum is payable on the amounts
withdrawn and outstanding, to meet
the administrative costs of IDA.

This Annex also records commitments during the year by the Bank’s
other affiliate, the international Finance Corporation. Fuller descriptions of those commitments are given
in the Annual Report of IFC, which is
published simultaneously with the
Bank/iDA Report.AFRICA

REGIONAL

Permanent Bank missions were established in western and eastern Africa, with
the primary object of assisting member
countries in identifying and preparing projects for presentation tc the Bank, IDA or
IFC for financing. The western African mission, in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, began operations in April, and that for eastern Africa,
with offices in Nairobi, Kenya, began work
in June. They were staffed initially with experts in transportation and agriculture.

A staff member was assigned by the
Bank for an initial period of two years as
Bank Representative in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for liaison with the United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa and with
the Organization for African Unity.

Field work on a study of experiences with
the development of African agriculture was
completed by a Bank mission; its report is
expected to be published toward the end of
calendar year 1965.

The Bank has agreed to act as Executing
Agency for a United Nations Special Fund
survey of transport requirements of the
southern regions of Cameroon and the
Central African Republic.

BECHUANALAND
TRANSPORTATION—ROADS

$3.6 million IDA credit of August 3, 1964.
The Bechuanaland Protectorate, a United
Kingdom dependency in southern Africa,
has an area of 225,000 square miles and
is entirely landlocked. The main occupations of the people, who number about
450,000, arecattle-raising and subsistence
agriculture. The livestock industry is capable of considerable expansion and future
economic growth depends chiefly onits development. A prerequisite, however, is an
integrated road system. It will permit the
transport of cattle to markets by truck, assist in the redistribution of cattle from
overgrazed and overstocked regions of the
country, and open new areas to production. The IDA credit to Bechuanaland was
therefore for a project which will improve
the road system.

The north-south road, which éxtends 418
miles from the border of Rhodesia to that
of South Africa and connects all the larger
towns in Bechuanaland, will be improved
to all-weather standards; it will stimulate
agricultural development in the regions
served and facilitate through traffic. The
main east-west road extending from Francistown to Maun across the Territory will be
built or rebuilt. It will enable cattle to be
moved by truck to the railhead at Francistown for shipment to the Lobatsi abattoir
or to Rhodesia; the larger return that will
result tc producers will encourage increased cattle production, as well as cash
crop farming. Two short roads will be built
in the eastern part of the Territory, one
from the capital, Gaberones, to the South
African border, and the other from Serowe,
the largest town in Bechuanaland and
the center of a large cattle ranching and
crop producing area, to the railhead at
Palapye. Road maintenance will also be
improved through the purchase of additional equipment, a training program, and
the construction of maintenance depots
along the main roads. The total cost of the
project is estimated to be $4.6 million.

CAMEROON

The Bank is financing the foreign exchange
cost of preparing a project to check the decline in cocoa production and to improve
its quality in selected areas. The study also
covers the requirements for feeder roads
to facilitate the collection of cocoa. The
work is being undertaken in cooperation
with the Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations (FAQ). The cost to
the Bank is estimated at $120,500.

The Bank is also meeting the foreign exchange costs, estimated at $200,000, ofa
study and recommendations for further
improvement of the N’Gaoundere-Garoua
Road.

GABON
TRANSPORTATION—ROADS
$12 million 20-year 54% Bank loan of
July 10, 1964, to Gabon.
Gabon’s dense tropical forests have traditionally been its mast important resource.
Although petroleum, manganese ores and
uranium are making a growing contribution to the economy, exports of tropical
hardwood still account for 60% of Governmentincome and of foreign exchange earnings. Since economically useful timber
along the coast and near navigable rivers
is gradually being exhausted, new logging
areas farther inland must be opened up to
avoid a serious drop in timber production.
The Bank foan will help to finance the
construction or improvement of three
roads, with a total length of about 116
miles, leading into the so-called Second
Forest Zone where logging companies are
ready to operate as soon as penetration
roads are built. Funds are included for final
engineering and supervision of construction. The roads will give ready access to
stands of timber which will permit logging
at the rate of 200,000 tons a year for more
than 20 years; this annual increase represents a fourth of present timber exports.
Funds from the loan will finance feasibility
studies and preliminary engineering for a
further 175 miles of roads in the interior
forest zone, as well as for improved loading
facilities at the logging port of N’Djale on
the Ogooue River. The loan will also finance
the services of experts to strengthen the
technical staff of the Directorate of Public
Works, and the procurement of equipment and materials for a pilot road maintenance division.
Participation totaling $115,000: by
First National City Bank.

OTHER ACTIVITIES - Work was completed
on a railway study financed by the UN
Special Fund, with the Bank acting as
Executing Agency. The study comprises
surveys of the technical and economic
feasibility of a railway to transport iron ore
from the Mekambo mines to a seaport
near Libreville and studies of the railway’s
impact on the economic development of
Gabon. The technical report has been finished and the economic study should be
ready by July 1965.

KENYA

AGRICULTURE—TEA PRODUCTION

$2.8 million IDA credit of August 17, 1964.
Tea production has become one of the
most important industries in Kenya, with
tea now ranking as one of the three leading exports. Although the greater part of
the tea is produced on large estates, emphasis in recent years has been given to
expanding tea growing by African smallholder farmers. A program, started in the
nineteen-fifties and considerably expanded after 1960 with the financial and
technical assistance of the Commonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC), provided
for the planting of 11,100 acres of tea and
the construction of six tea factories; it has
proved so popular that over 20,000 farmers
have already participated.

IDA, in association with the CDC, is assisting in financing the second stage of the
program under which 14,400 acres of tea
will be planted and 10 additional tactories
will be built. It aims to provide about 15,000 smallholders, some of whom are already participating in the program, with a
cash income, improving their standard of
living. The increased tea production will
contribute substantially to Kenya’s foreign
exchange earnings.

The IDA credit will be used for expenditures on field development, which includes
materials and equipment for nurseries,
field supervision, inspection and collection
of leaf to be delivered to factories. The total cost of the field sector is estimated at
the equivalent of $4,928,000 of which the
CDC will contribute $686,000, together
with approximately half of the $4,032,000
required for the construction of the new
tea factories.

The development of smallholder tea cultivation is organized and supervised by the
Kenya Tea Development Authority. The
Government of Kenya will relend the proceeds of the credit to the Authority, with
repayment to be made in 16 years, including a nine-year grace period, and interest
of 5%.

TRANSPORTATION—ROADS

$3 million IDA credit of June 30, 1965.
This credit is assisting a road project which
is an integral part of the smallholder tea
development program being carried out by
the Kenya Tea Development Authority. It
will help to finance the engineering, construction or reconstruction of approximately 800 miles of tea collection roads
and nine factory access roads totaling 94miles in length, and equipment for 15
small units for maintenance of the roads.
The tea collection roads, where traffic will
be light, will be built to relatively modest
standards and surfaced only where drainage is poor and grades are steep. The factory access roads will be subject to much
heavier traffic and will be built to higher
standards and surfaced throughout. The
Government of Kenya will be responsible

for maintenance of the roads. The 15.

maintenance units will be centrally located
near the tea factories and will be used for
day-to-day maintenance of the roads. The
Kenya Tea Development Authority will manage these units with funds and equipment
provided by the Government. Local authorities will undertake periodic maintenance
in their own areas and the Government will
ensure that they have sufficient funds tor
this purpose.

The total cost of the project is estimated
at $4.2 million. The roads will be finished
in 1968—in time for the transport of tea to
factories from the newly planted areas
when the seedlings mature. Although the
roads are being built mainly for the transport of tea in various parts of central and
western Kenya, they will also improve transport for other commodities, such as milk,
vegetables, fruit, wattle bark, pyrethrum
and charcoal.

TRANSPORTATION—ROADS

$4.5 million IDA credit of

December 29, 1964.

An extensive road network is of primary
importance to the continuing economic development of Kenya. The railway is used
primarily for long distance haulage between market centers and the port of Mombasa on the Indian Ocean, and roads are
needed to supplement it. There are now
about 26,000 miles of roads of which 3,900
are classified as primary roads. Good progress has been made in recent years in
improving the highway system and part of
a World Bank loan of $5.6 million made in
1960 assisted in the construction of one
new road and the improvement of 22 roads
totaling 400 miles.

The project being assisted by this IDA
credit is essentially an extension of the
road work carried out earlier. It involves
the up-grading of additional roads in widely
separated parts of the country. The work
includes the relocation of several road sections, improvement of drainage, paving,
and the replacement of 18 narrow and
poorly located bridges. The improvements
should contribute to the efficiency of the
trunk road network as a whole: they will result in better access to important cash
crop praduction and marketing centers,
and in a reduction of transport and road
maintenance costs. The IDA credit will

cover about three-fourths of the total estimated cost of $6 million.

MAURITANIA

TRANSPORTATION—ROADS.

$6.7 million IDA credit of

December 28, 1964.

This credit was part of an operation in
which IDA joined for the first time with the
European Development Fund (FED) of the
European Economic Community to provide
finance for a development project. FED’s
contribution amounted to $3,220,000.
Funds from both institutions will be used
for the construction of a 125-mile two-lane,
all-weather road between Nouakchott, the
capital of Mauritania, and Rosso, on the
border of Senegal. In addition, IDA will finance the design and supervision of construction of the road and a study of general
road maintenance requirements.

With the exception of a railroad in the
north used for the transport of iron ore
from Fort Gouraud to Pert Etienne, the only
means of surface transport in Mauritania
is a rudimentary road network of unimproved earth roads and tracks. The most
densely settled and agriculturally promising part of the country is in the south. This
region is at present supplied largely
through the port of Dakar in Senegal which
involves costly and time-consuming transshipments. A new wharf being built at Nouakchott will give the capital direct access to
the sea and the road being financed will
provide a permanent artery between the
wharf, Nouakchott, and Rosso in the Senegal Valley. It will substantially’ reduce the
distance over which Mauritania’s exports
and imports must be shipped, reduce vehicle operating costs, and save road maintenance costs. The Mauritanian Government is retaining consultants to draw up
the final design and to supervise construction of the road, as well as to undertake a
study of maintenance requirements for the
entire road network. The project is scheduled for completion in 1969 at a total estimated cost of $10 million.

MOROCCO

AGRICULTURE—IRRIGATION AND

LAND DEVELOPMENT

$17.5 million 25-year 542% Bank loan of
August 26, 1964, to Morocco.

This loan will assist in carrying forward a
program begun in 1962 for the comprehensive development of the Sidi Slimane
area in the Rharb Plain about 65 miles

northeast of Rabat, the capital. The cultivable area at Sidi Slimane comprises 217,000 acres and its soil and climate make it
one of the most promising agricultural
areas in Morocco, particularly where irrigation is available. The program is a pilot
undertaking to introduce modern intensive
agriculture, and its successful execution
will point the way to similar developments
in other parts of the country. Its purpose is
to improve the quality and quantity of agricultural products both for the home market and for export, to diversify production
mainly through the introduction of sugar
beet to meet part of Morocco's sugar requirements, and to improve living standards through raising the level of farm
incomes.

The Bank loan will be used for the first
stage of the program, which is scheduled
for completion in 1968 ata total estimated
cost of $46.6 million. The main elements
are the improvement of the existing irrigation system on some 69,000 acres and
the construction of irrigation works for an
additional 10,000 acres; improvement and
extension of drainage facilities; improvement of existing farm-to-market roads;
consolidation of farm holdings, land leveling, construction of farm buildings and the
provision of equipment to enable farmers
gradually to adopt modern methods of crop
production, dairy and livestock farming;
the completion of 11 Agricultural Service
Centers which will provide farmers with
equipment, seeds, fertilizer, transport and
marketing services, as weil as advice and
vocational training; and the establishment
and stocking of 13 dairy centers which will
form the nucleus for increased milk and
meat production.

Participation totaling $100,000: by Bank
of America National Trust and Savings
Association.

OTHER ACTIVITIES+ The draft report of a
general survey mission to Morocco has
been submitted to the Government. It is
expected to be published in early 1966
after discussions with the Government. The
mission was organized by the Bank to assess the country’s development potential
and to make recommendations concerning
economic policy, institutional arrangements and the elements of an investment
program designed to accelerate economic
growth,

NIGERIA

ELECTRIC POWER

$82 million 35-year 542% Bank loan of

July 7, 1964, to the Niger Dams Authority.
The Bank foan was part of a $208 million
financing plan to build a large scale dam at
Kainji Island on the Niger River which, together with associated works and instalia
6768

tions, will be the final link in the creation of
a national power network. Other financing,
totaling about $57 million, will come from
Italy, the United Kingdom, the United
States and the Netherlands, to be drawn
upon mainly for purchases of equipment
or services to be provided from those countries. The Federal Republic of Nigeria will
finance local currency costs and any residual foreign exchange requirements not
otherwise covered.

The Kainji project is the largest yet to be
undertaken by Nigeria and is considered
to be the cornerstone of the country's National Development Plan (1962-68). The
project, located 260 miles north of Lagos,
the Federal capital, will consist of a main
dam about 14,000 feet long and 215 feet
in maximum height, a power station containing initially four 80,000-kilowatt generating units and facilities for eight more
units of the same size, an auxiliary dam,
navigation locks, a transmission system
and attendant works and installations.

When completed the Kainji project will

supply all the major load centers served by
the Electricity Corporation of Nigeria (ECN).
Three main transmission systems now being formed by ECN will be interconnected
with Kainji to create a national grid. Kainji’s initial capacity of 320,000 kilowatts will
be sufficient to meet the demand expected
by 1968; additional units will be installed
periodically thereafter to increase total
capacity to 960,000 kilowatts by 1981. In
addition to power, other benefits can come
from improved navigation on the Niger
River and from the development of fisheries in the reservoir, which will cover an
area of 500 square miles.

EDUCATION

$20 million IDA credit of March 1, 1965.
The credit will help to finance high priority
education projects, involving some 192 institutions in all, in the four Regions of Nigeria and the Federal Territory. It provides
for the expansion and construction of
schools which will increase pupil enrollment by 11,000 in secondary schools, by
700 in teacher training schools and by
5,000 in trade training schools. Some 9,000 of the additional secondary school
places will be in Northern Nigeria which
contains about half the population and
where the growth of secondary education
has been relatively slow. Of special impor
tance are a new Advanced Teacher Training College in Northern Nigeria which will
reduce the present dependence of secondary schools on expatriate teachers, a National Teacher Training College in Lagos
which will train technical college and trade
instructors for the whole of Nigeria, and
the addition of science laboratories and
metal and wood workshops at many secondary schools, which will reduce the prevailing emphasis on academic studies at
the expense of scientific and technical
training.

The project has been drawn from Nigeria’s National Development Plan which
gives priority to the acceleration of education of ail kinds and atall levels. Because of
the importance of expanding and improving secondary education to increase the
availability of intermediate and high level
manpower essential to the developing
economy of Nigeria, nearly 60% of the project’s total cost of $30 million has been allocated to general secondary education.

The Federal Government will relend the
proceeds of the credit to the Regional Governments in the amounts allocated to them
on the same terms it receives from IDA.

TRANSPORTATION—ROADS.

$15.5 million IDA credit of March 1, 1965.
The Nigerian National Development Plan
includes a six-year program for road development in Northern Nigeria, an area of
282,000 square miles. Although much of
the long-haul freight is carried by rail, an
extensive road network is essential to link
with railway centers and to interconnect
producing and consuming centers. The
project being assisted by the IDA credit includes high priority items in the road program and consists of the building of three
new roads totaling 225 miles in length and
the improvement of another 50 miles of
feeder roads.

Two of the roads will connect with the
new Bornu railway extension in the northeast, which was completed in 1964 with
the help of a $28 million World Bank loan
made in 1958. One of them will extend 128
miles from Maiduguri, the terminus of the
railway, to Baga on Lake Chad. This road
will open up an agricultural area to yearreund traffic and will facilitate the transport of agricultural products and fish from
Lake Chad. The second road runs 82 miles
from Biu to Gombe on the raitway, crossing
the Gongola River. This road will reduce
transport costs and stimulate increased
output of crops in a productive and densely
populated area. East of the river, about 50
miles of feeder roads, connecting with the
new road, will be improved. The third road
will extend 14 miles from Gumel to Maigatari, a market center on the border with
Niger. This road is part of the route to the

important railhead at Kano in Nigeria and
connects with new roads being built in
Niger with [DA assistance. The [DA credit
will also finance the services of consultants
to supervise construction of the roads and
the procurement of miscellaneous equipment needed for the road program. Priorities for the program were determined bya
study, completed in August 1964, which
the Bank helped to finance,

The Federal Government will relend the
proceeds of the credit to the Regional
Government of Northern Nigeria on the
same terms as it receives from IDA.

OTHER ACTIVITIES « A mission organized
by the Bank to study the progress of the
Nigerian Development Plan, priorities in
the principal sectors, capital requirements
and institutional arrangements and policies
related to economic planning and development completed its field work toward the
end of June. The mission's report is due in
September 1965.

A Bank staff member completed a twoyear assignment as Resident Representative. A member of the Bank’s Development
Advisory Service completed short-term
assignments as Economic Adviser to the
Federal Government and to the Premier of
the Mid-Western Region.

The Bank has agreed to help finance a
study which will provide the basis for improving and expanding the road network in
Eastern Nigeria. Foreign exchange costs to
be borne by the Bank are estimated at
$375,000.

SIERRA LEONE

ELECTRIC POWER

$3.8 million 20-year 542% Bank loan of
August 18, 1964, to the Sierra Leone
Electricity Corporation.

This was the first Bank operation in Sierra
Leone. It is helping to finance the construction of a 13,200-kilowatt diesel power plant
at King Tom Paint in Freetown, the capital,
and the expansion of electricity distribution
facilities.

The greater part of the country’s population of some 2.2 million is engaged in subsistence agriculture including fishing. in
the past 10 years minerals have assumed
an important role in the economy, accounting for 80% of the value of exports. There
is limited use of electricity in Sierra Leone
at the present time. The largest demand is
in the Freetown area where power growth
has averaged 16% annually in recent years
and is expected to increase at a rate nearly
as high for the next several years. There
are now two plants in Freetown with a total
capacity of 9,800 kilowatts. The new KingTom plant will more than double this capacity, and provision is being made for the
installation of a third 6,600-kifowatt unit,
which may be necessary by 1968. Construction of the new power station is
scheduled for completion this year at a
total estimated cost of about $5 million.

SOMALIA

TRANSPORTATION—ROADS,

$6.2 million IDA credit of March 29, 1965.
This credit was part of a joint operation in
which [DA joined with the European Development Fund (FED) of the European
Economic Community and the United Nations Special Fund to provide financing for
a highway project which is expected to cost
approximately $14.2 million.

Over two-thirds of Somalia's population
of about 24% million are nomads engaged in
raising livestock. The rest of the people are
settled mainly in three areas: one in the
north, another in the south and the third
in the center of the country between
Baidoa and Mogadiscio, the capital and
principal port. Most of the people now
depend on primitive means of transport,
mainly the camel and donkey. Road transport is still in its early stages; nearly half
the network of 7,500 miles are only earth
tracks and all but about 500 miles are impassable during the rainy season.

The project being financed is a comprehensive approach to developing an adequate road network. It involves the construction of a 125-mile, two-lane road from
Afgoi to Baidoa, passing through Somalia's
most important dry-farming area. It will
reduce the costs of transporting agricultural products to the largest consuming
center, Mogadiscio, which is already linked
to Afgoi by a 19-mile all-weather road, and
will encourage further production of food
crops. The project provides for adequate
road maintenance installations and equipment and for the creation of an effective
organization to carry out maintenance
operations .It also inciudes feasibility
studies of future roads and an analysis of

investment needs for all forms of transport
in Somalia.

The IDA credit will be applied to the cost
of constructing the road. Funds amounting
to $5,150,000 from FED will finance the
remainder of construction costs, consultants’ fees, and maintenance installations
and equipment. A Special Fund grant of
$2,095,000, together with $800,000 provided by the Government of Somalia, will
finance technical assistance of foreign
experts to carry out the transport studies
involved in the project, to staff and operate
the Highway Department and to train
Somalis in road maintenance and construction work. The World Bank will act as
Executing Agency for the Special Fund.

OTHER ACTIVITIES» A study to determine
a suitable site, form and layout for a deep

$7.7 million 25-year 542% Bank loan of
October 2, 1964, to the Central African
Power Corporation.

The project being assisted by the loan provides for the continuing development of
the Kariba hydroelectric scheme by the
construction of a second 268-mile, 330
kilovolt transmission line from Kariba to
Kitwe in the Copperbelt and an intermediate switching station at Broken Hill in
Zambia, together with an expansion of
existing substations at Kariba, Lusaka and
Kitwe.

The dam and 700,000-kilowatt power
plant at Kariba Gorge on the Zambezi
River were built with the help of an $80
million Bank loan made in 1956. Nearly
900 miles of transmission lines carry
power northward to the Copperbelt and
to the principal consuming centers of
Rhodesia to the south. The new transmission facilities are needed to meet the
increasing demands of the copper industry
and of the Central Electricity Corporation in
Zambia. The Copperbelt now also draws
supplies of power from the Democratic
Republic of the Congo under a contract
which terminates in late 1966. The new line
is scheduled to come into operation in
December 1966.

The Kariba system is owned and controlled jointly by the Governments of
Zambia and Rhodesia through the Central
African Power Corporation, a statutory
corporation established for that purpose.
The loan is guaranteed by the Governments of the United Kingdom, Zambia and

AFGHANISTAN

EDUCATION

$3.5 million IDA credit of

November 23, 1964.

This was the first operation in Afghanistan
by one of the World Bank group. It will help
to finance the construction and equipment
of seven vocational schools at the secondary level; an academy for training
teacher educators and a technical teachertraining school in Kabul, the capital; an
agricultural, a mechanical and a teachertraining school in Kunduz in northern
Afghanistan; an agricultural and a
mechanical school in Herat in western
Afghanistan.

The Government has been giving increasing attention to the development of
a modern educational system in recent
years. During the First Five-Year Plan,
which ended September 1961, educational

70

expenditures increased almost threefoid
and school enrollment rose by 66%. The
current educational program gives emphasis to improving the quality and effectiveness of education to provide the qualified manpower essential to the country's
economic and social development. The
project being assisted by the IDA credit is
part of this program. It will make it possible
to increase the output of agricultural technicians by about 100%, of skilled mechanical workers by about 50% and of primary
school teachers by 30% above the levels
otherwise scheduled for 1967. In the longer
term, the academy and teacher training
schooi at Kabul will provide the staff required to double the primary teacher and
mechanical education training programs
in the next 10 years. The Government of
Afghanistan is providing $1.7 million for
the project, and expects to receive about
$2.5 million for staff and equipment for
some of the schools from Unesco, UNICEF
and the Federal Republic of Germany.

OTHER ACTIVITIES « The Bank is assisting

CHINA

INDUSTRY—DEVELOPMENT FINANCE
COMPANY

$15 miilion 544% Bank loan of December 17,
1964, to the China Development
Carporation (CDC).

CDC, a private development finance company, was established in 1959 to assist
the establishment, modernization and expansion of private industrial enterprises
in Taiwan. An IDA credit of $5 million made
in 1961, together with a $10 million loan
from the U.S. Development Loan Fund,
provided its foreign exchange resources.
This year’s Bank loan will replenish those
resources, enabling the CDC to meet its
foreign exchange requirements until mid1967.

Industrial production in Taiwan, particularly exports, has expanded rapidly in
recent years: output has grown at an
average rate of 16% since 1958, while industrial exports have risen at an average
rate of 40% annually. CDC has made a significant contribution to this growth. Exports by CDC's clients have risen from
$10 million in 1959 to $85 million in 1964.
CDC has approved 269 loans for 237
industrial projects totaling $36.6 million
and has made 12 equity investments and
16 guarantees totaling $4.2 million. Chemical, ceramic and textile industries accounted for about two-thirds of thefinancial transactions both by number and
value, Other industries which received
assistance were food and beverages, electrical equipment, wood processing, coal
mining and iron and steel.

Industrial growth is expected to continue
at a high rate and the availability of longterm finance is important to the realization
of Taiwan’s full growth potential. With the
additional resources provided by the Bank
loan, CDC can be expected to continue to
play a leading role in Taiwan's industrial
development.

The Bank loan will be committed in parts
by CDC for individual projects and each
part will be repaid according to a schedule
to be determined at the time of the commitment, subject to a maximum term of
15 years from the date of commitment.

TRANSPORTATION—RAILWAYS

$20 million 20-year 5\2% Bank loan of
April 28, 1965, to the Republic of China.
This loan will assist in financing high
priority items in the current improvement
program of the Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA). Railways are the principal
means of transportation in Taiwan, carrying about four-fifths of the freight traffic
and nearly half the country’s passenger
traffic. The system is operated by TRA and
consists of the West and East Lines which
are separated by a chain of high mountains
and have no interconnection.

The improvement program now under
way is designed to increase the capacity,
efficiency and safety of the railways, to
provide better service and to reduce operating expenses. The key elements of the
program are further dieselization, the replacement of overage rolling stock, the
provision of centralized traffic control and
of adequate safety devices, and the replacement of the congested marshalling
yard that serves the Keelung-Taipei area,
the most populous and industrialized part
of the country.

The part of the program being assisted
by the Bank loan will cost a total of $30.2
million. It includes the purchase of 55
diesel locomotives; the provision of 150
new passenger cars of various types, of
which 89 will be built in Taiwan with imported components; the purchase of components for 1,065 freight cars which will
be constructed in Taiwan; equipment for
centralized traffic control; the installation
of automatic block signaling; automatic
signaling equipment at 200 grade crossings; and materials for the construction
of a new marshalling yard at Chi Tu which
will have the capacity to handle some 2,000
cars daily, or more than twice the capacity
of the existing Hua-Shan yard.

INDIA

TELECOMMUNICATIONS

$33 million IDA credit of July 6, 1964.

This credit, like one of $42 million made by
IDA in 1962, is being made available to the
Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department
(P&T) as part of the Government's capital
investment in that organization. The proceeds of the credit are financing raw materials and components to be imported by
the three principal Indian manufacturers
of telecommunications equipment and by
P&T's own workshops, thus enabling ful!
use to be made of indigenous manufacturing capacity in supplying the needs of the
P&T program.

India has only about 1.3 telephones per
thousand inhabitants, compared with 50
for the world as a whole. The backlog of
applications for telephone service on which
deposits have been paid equals about half
the number of subscribers, and nonpriority applicants have to wait five years
or more for service. The expansion being
assisted by the credit will extend service
to about 75% more subscribers, as well
as improve the telecommunications network in many other ways.

P&T's expansion program under the
Third Five Year Plan calls for an investment
of $350 million. The program is being
executed by the P&T’s Telecommunications Branch which will provide a major
portion of the estimated $237 million
required in local currency. Among the improvements being carried out affecting
public telephone and telegraph facilities
and railway communications are the following: The number of telephone subscriber
sets is to be increased from 460,000 to
810,000. About 3,700 miles of coaxial
cable will be added to the 295 miles that
existed when the program began. About
1,500 miles of microwave radio links will
be installed. Nearly 1,700 miles of open
telephone lines along railways that are
being electrified will be replaced by shielded
underground cables. Teleprinters will be
installed to step up the speed of transmission on trunk lines to the international
rate of 66 words per minute rather than
the 25 words possible with existing equipment.

TRANSPORTATION—RAILWAYS
$62 million IDA credit of October 26, 1964.

The credit is helping to finance imports of
equipment and materials needed by the
Indian Railways for its development program during the 15-month period ending
September 30, 1965. Including this credit,
IDA and the World Bank have together lent
over $500 million for the Indian Railways—
by far the largest amount they have lent
for any single enterprise anywhere.

The Indian railway system, comprising
35,000 route-miles, is one ot the largest
systems in the world. Railway investments
under the Third Five Year Plan account for
about a fifth of the total investment in the
public sector. The greater capacity and
improved efficiency resulting from this and
earlier investment have made possible an
increase of 66% in freight traffic and 42%
in passenger traffic during the eight years
from 1955/56 to 1963/64. Last year the
railways carried 192 million tons of freight
and 1,870 million passengers; by 1966
freight traffic is expected to reach 205
million tons and the number of passengers
will probably be 15% greater than in
1963/64. Traffic growth at this pace requires a large and continuous program of
investment.

The railway investment under the Third
Pian calls for expenditures of $3,449 million, of which about $600 million will be
foreign exchange. The program, already
well advanced, places emphasis on equipping the system to carry heavier trains at
higher speeds. More diesel or electric locomotives and over 100,000 freight cars are
being acquired; some 1,500 route-miles of
track are being electrified; about 1,500
miles of newlines are being built; and workshops, bridges, yards and signaling works
are being improved. In order to reduce
foreign exchange expenditures, the Railways have begun to build their own electric
and diesel locomotives. The 1964 IDA
credit will finance the import of steel and
components for locomotives, electric
multiple units, coaches and freight cars,
track and signaling equipment and materials for the electrification program.

the Bank's sixth loan to ICICI, bringing the
total amount of Bank lending to the Corporation to $140 million.

In its 10 years of operation, ICICI has
approved financial assistance totaling
1,023 million rupees ($215 million) for 374
projects. This included foreign exchange

7172

and rupee loans, underwriting operations
and direct equity investments. Although
there was wide variety in the type of industry receiving financial assistance, ICICI
concentrated on those industries, such as
machinery, machine tools and chemicals,
that are relatively new in India. About a
third of the 125 projects which have already come into production were sponsored
by entrepreneurs entering industry for the
first time.

With the continued growth expected in
the private industrial sector in India, the
demand for ICICI financing is expected to
rise, particularly for foreign exchange
loans. This year’s Bank loan will cover the
bulk of ICICI’s foreign exchange requirements until mid-1967. The Corporation fs
also taking steps to increase its rupee
funds. As a result of the new financing,
ICICI will have had total resources over the
years equivalent to $225 million.

Repayments of the Bank loan will be
subject to adjustment from time to time so
that ICICI's repayments to the Bank will
correspond approximately to the borrowers' repayments to ICICI which are not to
extend beyond 15 years in each case.

ELECTRIC POWER
$70 million 26-year 5'¥2% Bank loan of
June 11, 1965, to India.
During the past few years there has been
rapid developmentin India of transmission
facilities to interconnect power sources
within the States. With the impetus being
given to industrial expansion in India’s
successive Five Year Plans and the large
investments required to provide for the
accompanying rise in demand for electricity, it is becoming increasingly necessary to form regional transmission systems
to make the most economical use of power
generating capacity. India is therefore
taking steps to further integrate its power
systems by interconnecting State systems
to form regional networks. Such a program
is strongly endorsed by the Government's
Energy Survey Committee, which recently
completed an exhaustive study of India’s
energy resources and requirements.
This toan will help to finance an extension
of existing power transmission facilities,
the interconnection of smaller systems
within each of the States, and facilities
which will provide the first effective steps
toward the operation of integrated regional
systems. This involves the construction of
approximately 8,000 miles of high voltage
lines and the construction or extension of
300 substations. These works form part of
the power transmission system expansion
under the Third Pian which will cost an
estimated $390 million. Of the 30,000
miles of transmission lines being erected
under the Third Plan, about 22,000 miles

have been built or are under construction.
The Bank loan will provide the foreign
exchange required to complete the program and to build some of the most urgent
works programmed for the Fourth Plan.

$14 million 26-year 52% Bank loan of
June 11, 1965, to India.

This loan will help to finance the extension
of the Kothagudem thermal power station
now under construction in Andhra Pradesh
by the installation of two additional
60,000-kilowatt units and associated
works. An IDA credit of $20 million was
made in May 1963 for the first stage of the
project; the current extension will bring
the station to its designed capacity of
240,000 kilowatts. When Kothagudem and
another large power project now under
construction are completed, the installed
capacity in Andhra Pradesh will be increased from 292,000 kilowatts in 1965 to
600,000 kilowatts in 1967. This will permit
the removal ofall restrictions on power consumption in Andhra Pradesh and, with the
bringing into production of new factories,
energy sales are expected to more than
double in the same period. The total cost
of both stages of the Kothagudem project
is estimated at $66 million.

In view of the location of the plant in
the center of the Singareni coal field, and
the proximity of adequate circulating water
supplies, the site at Kothagudem could be
expanded to provide for a generating capacity of one million kilowatts or more. It
ultimately may become one of the most
important sources of power not only for
Andhra Pradesh but also for the States
to be interconnected by the southern
regional system.

OTHER ACTIVITIES « The Bank continued to
maintain a resident mission in New Delhi.
The Chief of the mission ended a two-year
assignment in May 1965.

A study of India’s coal transport problem
was completed in July 1964 ata total cost
to the Bank of approximately $862,000.

A special mission completed field work
on an intensive study of the country’s
economic position, in preparation for the
Bank’s appraisal of India's Fourth Five Year
Plan (April 1, 1966 to March 31, 1971).

Two meetings of the Consortium on Aid
to India were held during the year. Participants were representatives of Austria,
Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the Netherlands, the United
Kingdom, the United States, the Bank
and IDA. In April 1965, the Consortium
pledged the equivalent of $1,027 million,
subject as appropriate to legislative or

other necessary authorization, for the final
year (April 1, 1965 to March 31, 1966) of
the Third Five Year Plan, bringing the total
of pledges for the Third Plan to $5,472
million.

IRAN

TRANSPORTATION— ROADS

$32 million 25-year 572% Bank loan of
April 28, 1965, to tran.

This loan will help to finance the construction or improvement of 1,050 miles of
main highways. When they are completed
iran will have some 4,860 miles of roads,
or about a third of its main highway network, built to modern standards. Three
Bank loans, totaling $122.5 million, will
have assisted this development. The highways so far completed have already had
a favorable impact on the economy. The
volume of traffic has doubled, with commercial vehicles accounting for up to 80%
of the total. Productive activities have
grown in the areas served, and the charges
of public carriers have been reduced. Furthermore, competent and well-equipped
lranian road construction firms have
been developed.

Two of the roads to be improved with
the assistance of this year’s loan are in
the southern part of the country: the NainKerman road which connects the Kerman
area with the industrial and marketing
center around Isfahan and is an important
part of the arterial highway between
Tehran and the southeastern provinces;
and the Kerman-Sirjan road which will
continue the highway southward to connect with a road being built by the Government to the new port under construction
at Bandar Abbas. The highways traverse
an area of potentially productive land and
one rich in mineral resources. A third road
will extend from Shahpasand to the Afghan
border via Meshed. This will be an important trunk road serving Meshed, one of
the country’s largest cities and the administrative center of northeastern Iran, and
an international road connection with
land-locked Afghanistan. The TehranRudenhen-Babol road, built in recent
years, will be paved to accommodate the
heavy volume of traffic between the capital and the Caspian littoral. The project
is scheduled for completion in 1968 at a
total estimated cost of $90 million.
Participations totaling $890,000: by Irving
Trust Company, Bank of America National

$8.5 million 20-year 542% Bank loan of
April 28, 1965, to Iran.

This loan will assist a project for the can-struction of some 50 feeder roads with a
total length of 1,125 miles to connect six
agriculturally productive areas with the
main highway system and thus with large
consuming centers.

About 70% of Iran’s population of 21
million resides in rural areas and is engaged mainly in subsistence farming. Modernagriculture is now being developed—but
is confined generally to areas with easy
access to markets. In areas without roads
practically all farm-to-market transportation is still provided by the farmers themselves using donkeys, pack horses, or
even shoulder packs. Adequate road transport into agricultural areas will enable the
farmers to seil their products for higher
prices at more distant markets and to
devote more time and energy to farm
activities, will facilitate and improve the
efficiency of the Government's extension
services, and will lower the price of farm
materials. These factors should lead to
expanded areas of cultivation, to more intensive use of existing farm areas, and to
the growing of more profitable cash crops.

The areas in which the feeder roads will
be built were selected on the basis of their
proximity to the existing highway system,
the fertility of the land, the availability of
irrigation facilities and the possibilities for
further expansion of agricuitural production. Four of them are located on the
Caspian littoral, the fifth is about 75 miles
northwest of Tehran, and the sixth and
largest is in the vicinity of Kermanshah and
Hamadan in west-central Iran. The project
is scheduled for completion early in 1969
ata total estimated cost of $33.7 million.
Participations totaling $355,000: by First
National City Bank, and Bank of America
National Trust and Savings Association.

OTHER ACTIVITIES» The Bank has agreed
to help organize and finance a study to
recommend the best means of reorganizing
port operations in lran. The Bank will pay
the foreign exchange costs, estimated at
$39,000.

A Bank mission undertook an economic
study of the results of a road loan made in
1959. The study attempts to compare the
actual costs and benefits of the project
with those originally expected and to
identify factors which may be crucial in
determining the economic success or
failure of a project.

JAPAN
TRANSPORTATION—ROADS

Japan's road network, excluding municipal
roads, exceeds 94,000 miles in length, but
less than 20% is paved. Most roads, even
national highways, are narrow and winding
with little or no shoulder. Traffic normally
operates under congested conditions and

as a consequence vehicle operating costs
are high and accident rates are heavy.
The number of registered motor vehicles
has reached 6.8 million—a fivefold increase in the last 10 years—and freight
and passenger traffic by highway has increased at a substantially higher rate than
other modes of transportation. The Government is taking measures to improve all
forms of transport and highways in particular. It has approved an investment
equivalent to $11.4 billion in highway construction, improvement and maintenance
over the five-year period from 1964 through
1969. The general objectives of the program are to double the paved length of the
general road network by 1969 and to increase the expressway network from 50
miles to about 500 miles. The two expressways for which the Bank made loans this
year are of high priority in this program.

$25 million 24-year 542% Bank loan of
December 23, 1964, to the Tokyo
Expressway Public Corporation.
This loan will assist in financing an $88 million expressway from Haneda, Tokyo's
international airport, to Yokohama. It will
bean eight-mile, four-lane toll road and, for
most of its length, will be built on piers as
an elevated structure over a city street.
The Tokyo Expressway Public Corporation was established in 1959 as a public
entity responsible for the construction and
maintenance of toll roads in Tokyo and its
suburbs. The new expressway is an extension of the one the Corporation already
operates between Tokyo and Haneda.
The Tokyo-Yokohama region is one of the
most densely populated and heavily industrialized regions of the world. It has a
population of 13 million, although it accounts for only slightly over 1% of Japan's
total land area, and is the country’s most
important center of finance, commerce
and industry. Approximately a quarter of
the larger industrial enterprises are located
in the area and a like amount of the country’s production originates there. In 1963
about 80% of the total tonnage of freight
traffic in the area was moved by truck. The
new expressway will relieve the severe congestion of city streets between Tokyo and
Yokohama and sharply reduce vehicle operating costs and travel time, both for
vehicles using the expressway and for
those which continue to use existing
streets.
Participation of $50,000: by Banque
Lambert, S.C.S.

$75 million 25-year 64% Bank loan of
May 26, 1965, to Japan Highway Public
Corporation.

The joan will help to finance a 66-mile
expressway between Shizuoka and Toyokawa, It is the final link in the 335-mile toll

expressway between Tokyo and Kobe for
which the Bank has already lent $205 million. The Tokyo-Kobe Expressway will be
open over its entire length in early 1969
and will alleviate traffic congestion in the
Tokaido region, one of the greatest concentrations of industry and population in
the world.

The western end of the Expressway, extending 114 miles from Kobe to Nagoya,
is already open to traffic. The ShizuokaToyokawa section is part of the Expressway
between Nagoya and Tokyo. It will be a
four-lane divided highway designed to the
same standards as the rest of the Expressway. Its estimated cost is $322 million; toll
revenues are expected to pay back the
entire investment costs, including interest,
in a period of 20 to 23 years.

The Shizuoka-Toyokawa highway is important not only because it will benefit the
Tokaido area as a whole, as part of the
Expressway, but also because it will improve local traffic conditions in its service
area—the Shizuoka and Aichi prefectures.
Taking into account the reduction in vehicle
operating costs and travel time, both for
these who will use it and for those who
continue to use a parallel highway, it is
estimated that total benefits in the first
year of its operation will be about 20 billion yen ($56 million).

ELECTRIC POWER

$25 million 25-year 5%% Bank loan of
January 13, 1965, to the Electric Power
Development Company, Ltd. (EPDC).

EPDC js a government corporation which
develops special hydroelectric power projects and sells the output of its plants in
bulk to private utilities. The loan will assist
in financing two hydroelectric plants with
a combined capacity of 274,000 kilowatts
which the Company is building on the
Kuzuryu River. Power from the plants will
be fed into a large interconnected system
which serves the central part of the country, the fastest growing industrial region in
Japan. It accounts for approximately 40%
of the nation’s total power consumption.
Between 1958 and 1963 consumption
more than doubled to a total of 48 billion
kilowatt hours, and is expected to reach
81 billion kilowatt hours in 1968. The
Kuzuryu project forms part of a coordinated program being carried out by EPDC
and three private power companies,
Hokuriku, Kansai and Chubu, to meet the
expected demands of the region in 1968,
at which time the interconnected system
will have a total generating capacity of
about 17 million kilowatts.

The two plants being built with Bank
assistance consist of a 220,000-kilowatt
pumped-storage station with an associated
dam and reservoir at Nagano. anda

7374

54,000-kilowatt conventional type station
at Yugami. The project is part of a plan for
the development of three sites on the
Kuzuryu River being carried out jointly by
EPDC and the Hokuriku Electric Power
Company. EPDC will sell the entire output
of its two stations to the Hokuriku company which will build a third station downstream. The main purpose of the Bank
project is to supply peaking capacity for
the central regional power system. Its total
estimated costis $92.5 million.

KUWAIT

MALAYSIA

WATER SUPPLY

$6.8 million 20-year 5%2% Bank loan of
February 26, 1965, to the Public Utilities
Board (PUB), Singapore.

The PUB, an autonomous public corporation, is responsible for water supply, gas
and electricity in the State of Singapore.
Its Water Department supplies substantially all the water used by Singapore's
more than 1.8 million people, as weil as by
a considerable sector of the population of
the nearby State of Johoreon the Malaysian
mainland. Water consumption in Singapore
has more than doubled since 1950 and
PUB's daily water sales averaged 68.2
miilion gallons in 1964. Daily sales are
expected to reach over 85 million gallons
in 1968; this projection may be exceeded
in view of the Government's program of
encouraging industrial development. The
Water Department has made notable progress in extending its service and increasing its supply, but new water sources will
be required by 1968. The Bank loan will
finance the first stage of a long range program to develop the considerable resources of the Johore River in the State of
Johore. !t includes intake works on the
Johore River, raw water supply conduits,
a treatment plant, pumping facilities, and
a 17-mile transmission main. These installations will increase the water supply by
30 million gallons a day, bringing total
production capacity to about 132 million
gallons a day. The project will provide
enough additional water for Singapore's
requirements until the mid-1970’s, and
lay the basis for future expansions for
many years thereafter. Construction
should be completed in 1968 at a total
estimated cost of $13.7 million.

NEPAL

A survey of transport facilities was carried
out as a first step toward the formulation
of a coordinated transport investment program within Nepal’s next Five-Year Plan,
beginning July 1965. The Bank paid the
foreign currency costs of the survey, approximately $100,000. The final report of
the consultants was to be transmitted to
the Government in July 1965.

PAKISTAN
TRANSPORTATION—INLAND WATERWAYS
$5.25 million IDA credit of August 26, 1964.
East Pakistan is composed largely of the
deltaic area of two of the world’s largest
rivers, the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.
This great system of rivers and estuaries
makes water transport economical and, in
many rural areas, it provides the only
means of transport. The inland waterways
comprise about 3,100 route-miles, which
grow to 4,900 miles in the flood season. In
1963 water transport accounted for 337
million ton-miles for cargo and 1,277
million passenger-miles; the number of
vessels had increased by a third in the
preceding five years. Further development
and improvement of inland water transport
is therefore important to the economy.
Because of siltation and the instability
of the rivers, there is special need for the
maintenance of channels, navigational aids
and pilotage service, and care and supervision in the construction and operation of
ports and landing facilities. To centralize
responsibility for providing these services,
the Provincial Government established the
Inland Water Transport Authority (IWTA) in
1958. An IDA credit of $2 million was made
in 1961 to improve and strengthen IWTA'’s
organization and to improve five inland
ports. This year’s credit will assist further
stages of IWTA’s development program.
They will cost a total of $10,350,000 and
include the establishment of radio location
stations to provide a vessel position-fixing

system and to serve as an aid to navigation; the expansion of a workshop for the
repair and maintenance of navigational
equipment; the construction of about 100
landing facilities; a salvage unit to remove
wrecks and obstructions to navigation; and
the continuation of consultants’ services.

An additional $950,000 is being provided
by the Bank under its technical assistance
program to cover the foreign exchange
costs of consultants’ services for a detailed
survey of river ports and waterways looking to the preparation of a plan of priority
improvements,

AGRICULTURE—IRRIGATION

$58.54 million IDA credit of July 21, 1964.
The credit was made available to the Indus
Basin Development Fund to help cover
the cost of works being constructed by
Pakistan in the Indus Basin, The Fund
was set up in September 1960 at the time
“The Indus Waters Treaty 1960"' was
signed, and is administered by the World
Bank. At that time the Fund was provided
with resources of about $900 million by
the Governments of Australia, Canada,
Germany, India, Pakistan, New Zealand,
the United Kingdom, the United States
and the World Bank. In April 1964 a Supplemental Agreement came into force
under which the Governments of Australia,
Canada, Germany, New Zealand, the U.K.,
the U.S., and the World Bank agreed to
provide an additional $315 million in foreign exchange to be applied toward the
cost of the works. The Government of
Pakistan undertaok to finance the local
expenditures not covered by the rupee
contributions provided for under the 1960
Agreement. An amount of $58,540,000
was to be in the form of a Bank loan or
an IDA credit, or both. The Bank and IDA
decided that in order not to overburden
Pakistan with external debt, this contribution should be in the form of an IDA
credit.

The first charge an the Indus Basin
Development Fund is the cost of constructing the dam on the Jhelum River
and the link canals and barrages specified
in the 1960 Agreement. Execution of the
works already under way is proceeding
well. The first link canal system, joining
the Chenab to the Sutlej River, was finished on schedule by the end of March
1965. If there are no unforeseen delays,
the Mangla Dam project on the Jhelum,
by far the largest undertaking, may be
compieted about a year before the required completion date of July 1, 1969.

The Indus Basin Development Fund is
also financing the cost of a study of the
water and power resources of West
Pakistan to provide the Government of
Pakistan with a basis for developmentplanning in the water and power sectors
of the economy within the context of the
successive Five Year Plans. A World Bank
team, headed by Dr. Pieter Lieftinck and
assisted by a number of consultant firms,
completed the first part of the study in
February 1965. A principal conclusion was
that the construction of a dam on the Indus
at Tarbela would be technically feasible
and that the economic return would be
substantial. The second part of the study,
covering the more comprehensive aspects
of water and power development in West
Pakistan, is in progress. Consultants’
studies will be completed in March and the
Bank’s final report is due in June 1966.

AGRICULTURE—FARM CREDIT
$27 million IDA credit of June 30, 1965.

This credit will be made available to the
Agricultural Development Bank (ADB),
Pakistan’s major source of medium and
long-term agricultural credit. The lending
program of the ADB for the next three
years, 1965-68, is being expanded by
about 50% to approximately $90 million
equivalent. Of the total, $40 million will
be required for medium and long-term
loans to farmers for the installation of private tubewells and farm machinery. The
IDA credit will provide $27 million of this
amount. The tubewells under the project
will provide irrigation for an estimated
700,000 acres and the farm machinery
will permit mechanization of some 500,000
acres. The net value of increased output
resulting from the investments should exceed $27 million a year.

Tubewell irrigation and farm mechanization have been important factors in the
increased agricultural production which
has made a major contribution to the success of Pakistan’s Second Five Year Plan.
Individual initiative, encouraged by Government policies, has been a key element
in this growth, particularly in West Pakistan
where nearly half the additional annual
water supply has been provided from private tubewells. Demand for tubewells has
increased sharply as farmers have become
aware of the profitability of such investments. Between 1959 and 1964 the number installed annually rose from 1,340 to
6,400, and is expected to increase to
8,000 a year during the Third Plan. The
availability of more water has been accompanied by more intensive cropping involving increased use of fertilizers, better
seeds, tractors, power tillers and other
farm machinery. A substantial increase in
medium and long-term credit will be required during the Third Plan in order to
finance the tubewell program and the
investments in farm machinery necessary
to achieve the projected increases in agri
cultural output. The ADB will be able to
expand its loans for these purposes with
the resources being provided by the
IDA credit.

The Government will relend the proceeds
of the credit to the ADB for a period of 20
years, including five years of grace and
interest at the Government's standard rate
for remunerative agricultural projects,
which at the time of the credit was 4%
per annum.

OTHER ACTIVITIES « The Bank continued to
maintain a resident mission, with offices
in Rawalpindi and Karachi, headed by a
member of the Bank's Development
Advisory Service.

An expert engaged by the Bank to carry
out a preliminary survey of the securities
market submitted his report to the Government. Further help is being given in the
preparation of a stock-exchange law, which
is under consideration.

The Bank has agreed to allocate up to
$830,000 to help continue for three years

institutions interested in development
assistance to Pakistan held its sixth meeting in Washington on July 16, 1964. Participants were Belgium, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands,
the United Kingdom, the United States
and the World Bank and IDA. Consortium
members pledged the equivalent of $431
million, subject as appropriate to legislative or other necessary authorization, to
assist the fifth and final year (1964-65) of
the Second Five Year Plan. In all, aid
pledged through the Consortium amounted
to the equivalent of $1,818.7 million during the four years 1961/62 through
1964/65. The seventh meeting was held
in Washington on June 1, 2 and 3, 1965.
The Consortium members agreed to meet

PHILIPPINES

WATER SUPPLY

$20.2 million 25-year 542% Bank loan of
July 22, 1964, to the National Waterworks
and Sewerage Authority (NWSA).

The loan will help to finance the first part
of a long-range program to provide an adequate water supply system in Manila and
its suburbs, which include the cities of
Quezon, Pasay, Caloocan and 16 contiguous municipalities. There is an acute
water shortage in the Manila area since
the supply system was designed to meet the
water requirements of only a million people.
The population has increased by one million to 2.8 million in 12 years and is continuing to grow at the same rate. The new
works will increase the water supply by
about 200 million gallons a day and should
meet requirements until the early 1970's.
Studies will be undertaken concurrently to
plan for Manila’s future water requirements and for the improvement of the
sewerage system,

NWSA, an autonomous government
agency, is also responsible for the water
supply systems in other cities and municipalities outside the Manila area. It will
initiate studies to make similar inprovements in the operations of these systems.
In addition to the physical improvements
of the Manila water system, NWSA is making extensive changes in its management,
organization and procedures to improve
its efficiency and finances.

The project being assisted by the Bank
loan will cost a total of $48.2 million. The
loan will be applied to the foreign exchange
costs of the new installations which include
intake works, a four-mile tunnel, 16 miles
of aqueducts, additions to the treatment
plant, nine pumping stations and reservoirs, and additional transmission and
distribution mains.

This was the Bank's first loan in the field
af education. The beneficiary is the College
of Agriculture of the University of the
Philippines at Los Banos. The College is
currently engaged in a comprehensive Five
Year Development Program. It is conceived
asa means of strengthening the College's
role as the country’s leading source of
high-quality professional personnel for agricultural services, for research scientists
in public and private employment, and for
agricultural higher education. The Bank
loan will be used for improvements of the
College's physical facilities being undertaken in support of the academic objectives
of the Development Program. it will cover
about half the cost of constructing and
equipping 16 new buildings and of renovating three others. The locai currency
costs equivalent to $6 million will be met
by the Government.

Agriculture now accounts for a third of
the national product of the Philippines and
two-thirds of export earnings. There is a
large potential for further development,
however, if agricultural extension and research services are greatly improved and
other measures are taken to increase
productivity and encourage expansion of
cultivation. The Program of the Agricultural College is a vital part of a comprehensive effort now being made by the
Philippine Government to raise the level of
agricultural production. In recognition of
the importance of the College as a leading
agricultural institution in Southeast Asia,
the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations have
both pledged substantial grants to finance
educational and training elements of the
Development Program.

OTHER ACTIVITIES » A member of the
Bank's Development Advisory Service
completed his assignment as head of a
resident technical assistance mission.
However, at the request of the Government, the Bank agreed to extend the
assignments of the industrial, statistical
and agricultural advisers of the resident
mission for a further period of one year.

THAILAND

ELECTRIC POWER

$6 million 20-year 542% Bank loan of
March 22, 1965, to the Yanhee

Electricity Authority (YEA).

The Yanhee Electricity Authority was
established in 1957 with responsibility for
the generation and transmission of electric
energy in the most developed and populated part of Thailand—a service area
covering 33 of Thailand's 71 provinces.
Two earlier Bank loans, totaling $72.6 million, helped to finance the multipurpose
Bhumibol dam for the production of electric power, irrigation and flood control, and
transmission facilities to bring power to
Bangkok and 24 other communities. Two
units with a capacity of 140,000 kilowatts
were installed initially at the dam. This
year’s loan will help finance the installation of two more 70,000-kilowatt units,
works required for the future installation
of the next two units, an increase in substation capacity in Bangkok, and an extension of transmission lines to three more
communities.

YEA sells power in bulk to two utilities,
one serving the Bangkok area and the
other the rural communities within YEA's
service area. By far the largest power
market is Bangkok where demand has
risen by 66% in the past three years. This
increase has been due to the rehabilitation
of distribution facilities, the provision of an
adequate and reliable supply of power by
YEA, the introduction of a modern rate
structure, and a significant increase in
light and medium industry. During the
rest of the 1960’s the Bangkok area is
expected to absorb more than 80% of the
output of YEA’s plants, with power demand
increasing at an estimated average annual
rate of 14%. Demand is also expected to
rise substantially in rural! communities.
The expansion being assisted by the Bank
loan will cost a total of $9.8 million, and is
scheduled for completion in late 1968.
Participations totaling $600,000: by The
Chase Manhattan Bank, Irving Trust Company, Bank of America National Trust and
Savings Association, First National City
Bank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, Crocker-Citizens National Bank, and
Grace National Bank of New York.

AGRICULTURE—IRRIGATION

$22 million 20-year 54% Bank loan of
November 25, 1964, to Thailand.

The joan will finance the first stage of the
Me Klong River Basin development which
provides for the regulated irrigation, surface drainage and partial flood control of
432,000 acres in southwestern Thailand.
Eventually irrigation will be expanded to
964,000 acres. The current project includes land classification for the entire

development and feasibility studies for the
next stages. The Government will intensify
its extension services and establish demonstration farms in the area to instruct
farmers in irrigation farming and the use
of fertilizers. Rice production will continue
to be the principal crop during the rainy
season, and about 20,000 acres will be
suitable for the growing of other crops during the dry season.

This is the fifth loan made by the Bank

for the development of irrigation and improvement of flood control in Thailand.
Regulated water supply has been an important factor in the large increase in rice
production which, in the past 10 years, has
risen by a third. This has enabled Thailand
to meet domestic demand in the face of a
population growth rate which is now more
than 3%, and to maintain a surplus for
export which now accounts for nearly a
third of the country’s export earnings.
When the full benefits from the first stage
of the Me Klong River development are
realized in about nine years, it is expected
that the annual production of rice alone in
the area will increase from 200,000 to
400,000 tons, with a net benefit to the
economy of about $11 million annually.
Construction of the first stage will take
about five years and will cost an estimated
$57.9 million.
Participations totaling $1,025,000: by The
Chase Manhattan Bank, First National City
Bank, Bank of America National Trust
and Savings Association, and The First
Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company.

OTHER ACTIVITIES « The Bank continued to
maintain a resident mission in Bangkok.

Consultants completed field work on a
study of the future of the Port of Bangkok,
a continuation of the U.N. Special Fund
study of Thailand ports, for which the Bank
has been Executing Agency, which was
approved initially in 1959 and extended in
1960.

AUSTRALASIA

TERRITORY OF PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
“The Economic Development of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea,” the report
of a general survey mission organized by
the Bank, was published during the year.
The purpose of the mission, undertaken at
the request of the Australian Government,
was to review the economic potentialities of
the Territory and to make recommendations to assist in planning an econamic development program designed to raise the
standard of living of the people.FINLAND

TRANSPORTATION—ROADS

$28.5 million 15-year 542% Bank loan of
July 10, 1964, to Finland.

The National Board of Roads and Waterways (NBR) is responsible for the construction and maintenance of all public
roads in Finland; they comprise 24,000
miles of main roads and, by 1966, will include over 21,000 miles of local roads.
Road traffic has more than doubled in the
past seven years and NBR has built or
improved about 2,200 miles of roads in the
last three years alone, in an effort to keep
pace with the increased volume of traffic.

The Bank loan will assist the NBR in
financing the paving of 1,500 miles of
roads—mainly those newly built—which
are widely scattered throughout the
country and were selected on the basis of
traffic density; a 9-mile freeway between
Gumbole and Veikkola which is a continuation of the freeway between Helsinki and
Gumbole and part of the main highway
between Helsinki and Turku, the two
largest cities in Finland; and the purchase
of equipment for road maintenance which
in Finland is a very large operation because
of the need for snow removal to keep
traffic moving in winter.

Since Finland's transport sector will

require large investments in the coming
years, better planning and coordination
have become essential. The Bank is helping the Government to organize a study
which will provide the basis for a coordinated transport policy and for the formulation of a long-range investment program;
funds from the loan will help to finance
this study.

INDUSTRY—DEVELOPMENT FINANCE
COMPANY

$14 million 542% Bank loan of

June 30, 1965, to the Industrialization Fund.
The industrialization Fund provides financial assistance to small and medium-sized

7773

private enterprises in Finland. Established
in 1954, it was reorganized by its Finnish
shareholders in 1963 with the collaboration
and financial assistance of the Bank and
the International Finance Corporation. in
the following 15 months, the Fund made
119 long-term loans and one equity investment totaling about $14 million; the investment was part of a joint transaction with
IFC,

The Fund's lending has been directed
toward support of the newer industries in
keeping with the Government's policy of
encouraging industry to diversify in order
to create new employment opportunities
for labor transferring from agriculture, and
to modernize manufacturing units so that
Finnish goods will be better able to compete with foreign products abroad and in
Finland, as import duties are reduced in
accordance with Finland’s 1961 agreement
with the European Free Trade Association.
Over half the Fund's loans were for the
metals, furniture-making and textile industries, The bulk of the remainder was for
food processing, non-metallic mineral
products, printing and publishing, chemicals, electrical machinery, paper, and footwear industries.

Applications for the Fund's financial
assistance totaled more than twice the
amount of the new resources of about
$16 million provided at the time of its
reorganization, reflecting the dynamism of
the private industrial sector and the particular need of the smaller companies for
long-term finance. In view of this demand,
the Fund’s pattern of lending is expected
to continue along the lines of the recent
past. The Bank loan will enable the Fund
to meet nearly half its expected requirements for additional funds until mid-1967.
In addition, the Fund has arranged to raise
during the next year the equivalent of
$7.8 million from Finnish sources.

The schedule of the Fund's repayments
to the Bank will be subject to adjustment
from time to time so that they will correspond approximately to the borrowers’ repayments to the Fund. The schedule will
provide for full repayment of the Bank loan
by June 1, 1982.

ITALY

INDUSTRY

$100 million 15-year 6%4% Bank loan of
June 28, 1965, to the Cassa per il
Mezzogiorno.

Since it was established in 1950 as the
Government's principal instrument for improving economic conditions in Southern
Italy, the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno has
made available the equivalent of $2.8 billion for the develapment of the South.
Seven earlier Bank loans totaling $298
million have assisted the Cassa program.
At first the Cassa’s investments were
mainly in agriculture and transportation,
but since the late 1950's increasing emphasis has been given to promoting
industry with the result that industrial
investment has risen sharply and many
factors favor further growth.

The primary channels for medium and
long-term lending to industry under the
Cassa program are three special credit
institutes: Istituto per lo Sviluppo Economico dell'ltalia Meridionale (ISVEIMER),
Istituto Regionaie per i! Finanziamento
alle Industrie in Sicilia (IRFIS) and Credito
Industriale Sardo (CIS). ISVEIMER operates on the Italian mainland, IRFIS in
Sicily, and CIS in Sardinia. Between 1953
and 1964 the institutes approved more
than 5,000 loans for a total equivalent to
$1.3 billion. Industrial lending under four
of the earlier Bank loans was channeled
through the institutes and provided $90.8
million to 21 enterprises, mainly producers
of chemicals, fertilizers and cement.

Since mid-1964, ISVEIMER, IRFIS and
CIS have been finding it difficuit to obtain
enough funds to achieve their desired rate
of lending. Loans requiring over $200 million have been approved by the institutes
but have not been signed because of
lack of funds. This year’s Bank loan, which
will be re-lent by the Cassa to the institutes, will cover part of this financing gap.
It will assist in financing about 150 industrial projects for which the institutes are
prepared to make loans as soon as funds
are available.

Participation totaling $50,000: by Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechselbank.

PORTUGAL
ELECTRIC POWER
$15 million 20-year 54%% Bank loan of
April 29, 1965, to Empresa Termoeléctrica
Portuguesa, S.A.R.L. (ETP).
This loan will assist in financing the first
stage of the Carregado thermal power
plant near Lisbon. The plant will have an
initial generating capacity of 125,000 kilowatts and is designed for an ultimate
capacity of 500,000 kilowatts. Power from
the plant will be fed into the national power
transmission network. When the first stage
of the plant comes into operation in mid1967, the total generating capacity of
Portugal's primary system will be about
1.5 million kilowatts.

Power demand in Portugal has been

growing at an annual average rate of about
11% since the early 1950's and is expected
to continue to increase at this rate into the
early 1970's. The Carregado thermal plant
is part of a program to provide the generating capacity required to keep pace with
demand, particularly from Portugal’s expanding industries. Furthermore, it is the
first large thermal plant to be built since
the Portuguese authorities decided to
include major thermal sources in their
power development program in order to
supplement and balance the predominantiy hydroelectric system. A loan of $5
million made by the Bank to ETP in 1963
for a 150,000-kilowatt thermal plant near
Oporto also included funds for preliminary
engineering studies of the Carregado
plant. The total estimated cost of the
project is $25 million.

Participations totaling $750,000: by Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit, CrockerCitizens National Bank, Detroit Bank and
Trust Company, Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust

OTHER ACTIVITIES «A five-man mission to
advise on development financing, organized jointly by the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, completed
its assignment and submitted its report
to the Government. The mission concentrated chiefly on tax reform, budgetary
policy, the capital market and the banking system.

SPAIN

TRANSPORTATION—RAILWAYS

$65 million 20-year 52% Bank loan of

July 31, 1964, to the Red Nacional de los
Ferrocarriles Espaiioles (RENFE).

RENFE, the Spanish railroad authority,
has undertaken a 10-year modernization
program (1964-73) that will require an
investment of some $1 billion and provides for the reorganization and improvement of many phases of RENFE’s operations as well. The Bank loan will finance
about a third of the investments planned
for the first two years of the program,
1964-65. It will be used to acquire diesel
shunting locomotives, passenger and
freight cars, ties and switches, machine
tools, signaling and communication
equipment, and equipment for marshalling yards.

The Spanish railways camprise some
8,125 route-miles and carry an important
part of the nation’s freight and passenger
traffic. They transport large quantities of
coal, mineral ores, oil, fertilizers, cement,
sugar and grain in long distance traffic.In the last three years freight and passenger rail traffic increased at annual rates of
approximately 6% and 15% respectively,
with freight traffic averaging 4.5 billion tonmiles annually. Largely because of its
antiquated facilities, however, RENFE has
incurred substantial operating losses.
Track must be renewed, obsolete steam locomotives and overage passenger and
freight cars must be replaced, uneconomic
lines discontinued, and workshops and
marshalling yards newly built or modernized. The 10-year program is the most
comprehensive to be undertaken by the
railways and is based on the recommendations of a Bank general survey mission
which visited Spain in 1961 at the request
of the Spanish Government. With the
planned reduction in costs and improvement in equipment, it is expected that
RENFE will be able to eliminate its substantial operating deficit within several years
and to earn a net return by the end of the
program.

TURKEY

ELECTRIC POWER

$24 million IDA credit of July 14, 1964.
The credit will assist in financing a $43.5
million expansion program being carried
out by the Cukurova Electric Company.
The program will triple the Company’s
generating capacity, increasing the supply
of power to the Cukurova plain in southern
Turkey and enabling the Company to extend its service area to adjacent Hatay
Province.

The projects included in the program
consist of the construction of a 50,000kilowatt steam plant near Mersin beside an
oil refinery which will supply its fuel, a
100,000-kilowatt hydroelectric plant on
the Kadincik River some 30 miles from
Adana, and the construction of about 160
miles of transmission lines linking the new
stations to the existing system and extending it as far east as Iskenderun, Turkey’s
most important Mediterranean port. These
installations will supplement the power
from the Cukurova’s existing 54,000-kilowatt Seyhan hydroelectric station near
Adana which was built with the help of a

World Bank loan made in 1952 and expanded with the assistance of an IDA credit
made in 1963.

The Cukurova plain is one of the most
important agricultural regions in Turkey.
Nearly a third of the country's cotton crop
is grown there and processed locally in
many yarn, textile and cottonseed oil mills.
Over 70% of the Company’s power sales
are to these and other processing industries. In Hatay Province the chief demand for power comes from industrial
plants and from the activities of the port of
Iskenderun. The additional power from the
Gukurova system will relieve the acute
shortage of power that has prevailed there.

The Government of Turkey will relend
the proceeds of the IDA credit to the
Cukurova Electric Company for a term of
25 years, including a five-year period of
grace, with interest at 514%.

INDUSTRY—DEVELOPMENT FINANCE
COMPANY
$5 million IDA credit of August 31, 1964.
$10 million IDA credit of April 1, 1965.
Both credits are to replenish the foreign
exchange resources of the Industria! Development Bank of Turkey (IDB), a privately owned institution which finances
private industrial enterprises in Turkey.
The IDB came into being in 1950 and was
one of the first development finance companies to be established with the assistance of the World Bank. Since then it has
received financial assistance from all three
of the World Bank group of institutions:
$17.6 million from the Bank; $20 million
from IDA, including this year's credits; and
$916,667 in share capital subscribed by
the International Finance Corporation.

in its 14 years of operation the IDB has
financed a significant portion of private
industrial investmentin Turkey. By the end
of 1964 its financial assistance totaled $80
million: about $65 million in long-term
loans, $8.5 million in equity participations,
and the balance in short-term credits. The
industries assisted included those producing food products, beverages, textiles,
timber and wood products, rubber goods,
chemicals, stone, earthenware, glass and
ceramics, metal goods, machinery and
mechanical materials. In addition to its
financial operations, it has played an important role in acquainting the industrial
community with better techniques of investment planning and in raising the
standards of business management. It has
also helped to prepare the way for the
development of a capital market in Turkey
and expects to devote more of its activities
to this task in the future.

The Government of Turkey will relend
the proceeds of the credits to the IDB at
544% per annum and for periods deter
mined by the needs of IDB’s borrowers. As
IDB’s clients repay their loans, the IDB will
in turn repay the Government.

OTHER ACTIVITIES « In March 1965, the
Bank organized a mission to make an
appraisal of the country’s economic position and prospects for further development. The 16-man mission included
economists and specialists in agriculture,
irrigation, electric power, transportation,
manpower, industry, minerals and petroJeum and industrial management. It is now
preparing its report.

The preliminary phase of a power study,
to which the Bank contributed $29,557,
was completed in February 1965.

YUGOSLAVIA

TRANSPORTATION—RAILWAYS

$70 million 25-year 542% Bank loan of
December 11, 1964, to the

Yugoslav Investment Bank.

The Yugosiav railways form the backbone
of the country’s transportation system,
carrying more than 70% of the freight and
60% of passenger traffic. The railways are
carrying out a seven-year program to improve efficiency and increase capacity to
enable them to handle the increased traffic
which, by 1970, is expected to have risen
by more than a third for freight and a
fourth for passengers. The Bank loan will
assist in financing items of highest priority
in this program—electrification and a modern signalling system on three mainlines
and the construction of new marshalling
yards at Belgrade, Zagreb, Ljubljana and
Skoplje, and the improvement of existing
yards at Nis and Doboj. The installations
will double the capacity of the lines serving
the most heavily industrialized and populated area of Yugoslavia and provide faster
and safer service. The work should be
completed by 1968 at a total cost of $185
million.

The mainlines involved connect the six
largest cities— Belgrade, Zagreb, Sarajevo,
Skoplje, Ljubljana and Rijeka, and the area
they serve encompasses about two-thirds
of the country’s economy and half its
population. In close proximity to the lines
are coal mines producing half the country’s
total output, nearly all major steel works
and oil refineries, and leading producers of
cement, fertilizer, lumber and agricultural
products.

The Yugoslav Investment Bank, the main

channel used by the Federal Government
for foreign development loans, will relend
the proceeds of the Bank loan to the
agencies responsible for the execution of
the project.

BOLIVIA

ELECTRIC POWER

$10 million IDA credit of July 24, 1964.

$5 million IDA credit of July 24, 1964.
These were the first operations by any of
the World Bank group in Bolivia. They were
made simultaneously with a loan of $3.5
million from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to assist in financing a
$23.2 million electric power development
program which will increase the country’s
installed capacity by 38,000 kilowatts. In
addition to relieving a critical power shortage, which has resulted in rationing in the
principal cities, the program will provide
Bolivia with a sound basis for power expansion in the future.

The $10 million credit, together with the
IDB credit, is being made available to the
Empresa Nacional! de Electricidad (ENDE),
a company recently established by the
Government to be responsible for Bolivia’s
power requirements, with the exception of
those in the areas of the cities of La Paz
and Oruro. The funds will be used by ENDE
for the construction of a hydroelectric
power plant on the Corani River with an
initial capacity of 27,000 kilowatts. At first,
ENDE’s principal customers will be Cochabamba, the nation's second largest city,
and mines in the Catavi area. Transmission and distribution facilities will be built
for this service, as well as an interconnection at Catavi between the system of
ENDE and that of the Bolivian Power Company Ltd. (BPC).

BPC is now the largest power producer
in Bolivia and serves La Paz, the capital,
Oruro and the mines around Oruro. The
IDA credit of $5 million is being made
available to BPC for the construction of a
hydroelectric plant at Chururaqui, with an
initial capacity of 11,000 kilowatts. Transmission lines will be built to connect the
plant with the La Paz system, and the
distribution system in La Paz will be extended. The Government is relending the
proceeds of the credit to BPC for a period
of 25 years, including a three-year grace
period, with interest at 542% per annum.BRAZIL

ELECTRIC POWER

The two loans described below were the
first the Bank has made in Brazil since
1959. They were for projects that will add
nearly a million kilowatts to generating
capacity in the south central region, the
industrial heart of Brazil. The Bank has
already lent $208 million for the development of electric power in this region where
industry uses over 75% of the power produced. The Brazilian Government, with the
assistance of consultants working under
a United Nations Special Fund grant for
which the World Bank is Executing Agency,
has been making an intensive study of the
power market in the region for the past
two years. They estimate that demand will
continue to grow at the rate of 10 to 11%
per annum. To meet the demand through
1970, a short-term emergency program
has been prepared, calling for a doubling
of power output by that time. The projects
being assisted by this year’s loans are of
high priority within that program.

$57 million 25-year 5'4% Bank loan of
February 26, 1965, to Centra! Eletrica de
Furnas, S.A. (FURNAS).

FURNAS was established in 1957 and is
owned principally by Centrais Eletricas
Brasileiras S.A., a Federal Government
holding company. The loan will assist in
financing the construction of the $90 miilion Estreito project which will continue
the development of the hydroelectric
potential of the Rio Grande. The powerhouse will be designed to contain six
generating units, of which four with a combined capacity of 533,000 kilowatts will be
installed initially. The Estreito plant will
be located 100 miles downstream from
the Furnas 900,000-kilowatt plant which
was built with the help of a $73 million
Bank loan made in 1958. It will benefit
from the regulation of the flow of water
provided by the large reservoir at Furnas.
Concurrently with the construction of the
Estreito project, additions will be made to
the transmission network between the
Furnas and Estreito plants and the principal consuming centers.

Participation totaling $100,000: Stockholms Enskilda Bank is taking part of the
first maturity.

$22.5 million 25-year 542% Bank loan of
February 26, 1965, to Usinas Eletricas do
Paranapanema (USELPA).

USELPA was organized in 1953 as an
autonomous power agency of the State of
Sdo Paulo to develop and operate the
hydroelectric power potential of the
Paranapanema River, which along a
course of 181 miles has a potential of a

million kilowatts. USELPA now has two
plants with a combined capacity of
145,000 kilowatts in operation, which
were financed in part by two previous
Bank loans totaling $23.4 million. This
year’s loan will be used for the 400,000kilowatt Xavantes plant and transmission
lines to connect it with the Sao Paulo system. Xavantes has been under construction for several years and is scheduled
for completion early in 1969 at a total
estimated cost of $69.5 million.
Participations totaling $200,000: by Grace
National Bank of New York, and Meadow
Brook National Bank.

OTHER ACTIVITIES +In October 1964, the
Bank sent a 20-man mission to review and
appraise current economic conditions and
future prospects and to study the Government's econcmic development program
and policies. The mission’s report was submitted to the Government in March 1965.
The scope of the UN Special Fund survey
of power development for South Central
Brazil, for which the Bank is Executing
Agency, was extended to include the use of
coal for thermal power generation and an
evaluation of hydroelectric power sites.

CHILE

ELECTRIC POWER

$4.4 million 20-year 542% Bank loan of
February 12, 1965, to Empresa Nacional
de Electricidad, S.A. (ENDESA) and
Corporacién de Fomento de fa
Produccién (CORFO).

This loan will help to increase power supplies in three widely separated areas of
Chile where the Government is carrying
out programs to raise production and
standards of living. A 3,400-kilowatt hydraelectric unitis being installed in Antofagasta, an important port in the north, the
capital of a province rich in mineral resources and the site of newly established
industries. A 5,000-kilowatt gas turbine is
being installed in Punta Arenas, the largest
town in the extreme south of Chile, where
the development of oil resources in recent
years has increased the level of economic
activity. A submarine cable will be laid to
connect the power system of Chiloé, an
isiand off the coast of the south-central
region, with that of the mainland. Funds
are also included for the expansion of
transmission and distribution facilities
throughout the country, and for services
and equipment needed to carry out studies
looking toward the continuing expansion
of power supplies in Chile.

This was the first World Bank loan made
in support of the new investment and development program of the Chilean Government. The loan itself is the fourth in a
series of power loans to Chile, the first of

which was made in 1948. The earlier loans
totaling $61 million have helped to finance
plants with a combined generating capacity
of 589,000 kilowatts. Most of Chile’s power
demand is concentrated in the central
part of the country, where additional major
capacity will be needed by 1970 and plans
are being made for the necessary expansion. Public supply of power in the sparsely
populated regions to the north and south
is confined to a few cities and towns which
are served by isolated systems, mostly
without adequate generating capacity. The
loan made this year was largely to increase
supplies in these areas.

HONDURAS

TRANSPORTATION—ROADS

$6 million 25-year 542% Bank loan of
February 2, 1965, to Honduras.

$3.5 million IDA credit of February 2, 1965.
The Bank loan and IDA credit will finance
40% of the cost of building a 202-mile,
two-lane, all-weather road, called the
North Road, which will link the capital,
Tegucigalpa, with San Pedro Sula, the
country’s most important commercial
center. The North Road has been given
highest priority in the national and the
Central American Regional Highway investment programs. It will be part of the
transcontinental route running across the
Central American Isthmus from Puerto
Cortés on the Atlantic Ocean to the InterAmerican Highway at the Golfo de Fonseca
on the Pacific. The links in the north fram
San Pedro Sula to Puerto Cortés, and in
the south from Tegucigalpa to the InterAmerican Highway were built or improved
with the assistance of an earlier World
Bank loan.

In addition to benefiting international
travel, the North Road will traverse the
most heavily populated part of Honduras
and a zone in which most of the country’s
industry is located, as well as about a
quarter of the farmland. The road will

make an important contribution to political
and administrative integration of the country’s northern and southern regions
between which transport is slow and
costly. It will also result in a sharp reduction in transport costs. The total cost of
the project is estimated at the equivalent
of $23.6 million. The Inter-American
Development Bank has also lent $9.5 million for this project.

Participation totaling $90,000: by Bank
of America National Trust and Savings
Association.

JAMAICA

TRANSPORTATION—ROADS

$5.5 million 25-year 54% Bank loan of
April 8, 1965, to Jamaica.

This was the Bank’s first loan to Jamaica.
It will help to finance the improvement of
three road sections which are part of the
main thoroughfare from Kingston, the
capital, to the north and west of Jamaica.
The roads are among the most heavily
traveled in Jamaica and their improvement
will relieve congestion, speed up travel
time, and sharply reduce transport costs.
A 15-mile, four-lane road will be built
between Kingston and Spanish Town, the
third largest city. The second road will be
a two-lane road between Spanish Town
and Bog Walk, a distance of about 712
miles, and the third road will extend about
four miles from Moneague, north of Bog
Walk, to Crescent Park,

Jamaica has a relatively extensive road

network, of which 924 miles are main
roads connecting all the major towns and
important agricultural and industrial areas,
The standards to which the roads were
originally constructed, however, are becoming inadequate for today’s type and
volume of traffic. Between 1953 and 1963,
the number of motor vehicles increased
from about 19,000 to 72,000, an annual
increase of 15%, and substantial traffic
growth can be expected in the future.The
roads being improved with Bank assistance
were given priority in a survey recently
undertaken of Jamaica’s highway system.
The project is scheduled for completion in
1970 at a total estimated cost of $11
miilion.
Participations totaling $282,000: by the
New York Branch of Barclays Bank, D.C.O.,
and the New York Agency of The Bank of
Nova Scotia.

OTHER ACTIVITIES-The Bank has agreed
to allocate $200,000 to help meet the
foreign exchange costs of a feasibility
study of an urban expressway in the Kingston area.

In January 1965, a Bank staff member
was assigned as Project Preparation Adviser ta the Government,

MEXICO

TRANSPORTATION—ROADS

$32 million 20-year 542% Bank loan of
February 4, 1965, to Caminos y Puentes
Federales de Ingresos y Servicios Conexos,
and Nacional Financiera, S.A.

For many years Mexico has been improving the quality of its highway network and
extending it to provide for safer, faster and
more convenient movement of freight and
passenger motor vehicles which now number about a million. The country now has
about 30,000 miles of surfaced roads.
Where traffic is especially heavy or the lack
of bridges and ferries act as a bottleneck,
limited access toll roads and bridges are
being built. Earlier Bank loans totaling
$95.5 million have assisted Mexico’s highway program; the funds are being used for
the construction or improvement of about
5,000 miles of roads throughout the
country and for the construction of new
toll facilities.

This year's loan will assist the further
extension of the toll transport system in
the central part of Mexico where the
growth of urban areas has generated a
demand for fast intercity bus and truck
services and the increase in the number of
vehicles has overloaded regutar highways.
The project includes the construction of
four new toll roads, totaling 88 miles, three
toll bridges, and additional lanes on an
existing 130-mile road that is partly toll
and partly free, the acquisition of account:
ing equipment and of miscellaneous equipment for the operation of toll booths. The
new toll facilities will relieve congestion
and provide faster service on sections of
the main routes leading from Mexico City
northward to Guadalajara and eastward toward Veracruz, the country’s main port. A
further benefit will be that some of the
roads will encourage new economic activities to spread away from Mexico City, thus
reducing urban congestion and the costs
of supplying public services and facilities
to the city’s rapidly growing population.
The project is scheduled for completion in
four years ata total estimated cost of $78
million,

PARAGUAY

TRANSPORTATION—ROADS

$2.2 million 25-year 5%% Bank loan of
December 16, 1964, to Paraguay.

In 1961 IDA extended a credit of $6 million
to Paraguay for the improvement of 190
miles of the highway linking Asuncidén, the
capital, to Encarnacién, the second largest
city, and for the improvement of maintenance on the primary road network. Since
then the estimated cost of the road has
been increased by $2.5 million to a total of
$10.5 million. The Bank loan will provide
the additional foreign exchange needed for
compietion of the project.

Among the factors contributing to the
increased cost were unprecedented floods
that necessitated a redesign of major portions of the road, calling for higher embankment, enlarged drainage and bridge
works, and other preventive measures.
Furthermore, traffic had increased at a
much faster rate than had been predicted
so that the road has to be built to higher
standards throughout. The unexpectedly
rapid growth of traffic gives promise, however, that savings to road users will be even
greater than had been previously forecast,
despite the increased costs.

The Asuncién-Encarnacién highway
forms part of a triangle which encompasses
the most densely populated and potentially rich agricultural land in Paraguay. Its
development has been given top priority
by the Government and a survey is being
conducted by the United Nations Special
Fund, with the World Bank as Executing
Agency, to determine a network of feeder
roads to open up the hinterland and thus
increase the benefit of the trunk roads
forming part of the triangle.

Participation totaling $60,000: by Bank of
London and South America Limited.

PERU

AGRICULTURE—FARM CREDIT

$15 million 15-year 542% Bank loan of
June 3, 1965, to the Banco de Fomento
Agropecuario del Peru.

The Banco is the major source of agricultural credit in Peru and has been an important factor in the increasing output of crops
for both domestic and foreign markets in
recent years. Three earlier Bank foans totaling $15 million have assisted the Banco's lending program and this year’s loan
will provide half the funds required through
March 1967 for the Banco’'s medium and
long-term loans. As in the past, the Bank
funds will be used for such defined development purposes as farm water supplies, land improvement, agricultural machinery, livestock, fencing, tree and plantation crops, processing and storage facilities
and farm buildings.

Continuation of farm credit from the
Banco is essential to the implementation of
the Government’s agricultural policies for
meeting the economic needs of the country. Per capita food consumption is rising
with more and better food supplies and
improved wage levels. While agricultural
products comprise about a third of total
exports, Peru is still importing substantial
quantities of such foodstuffs as dairy products, cereals, meat and fruit. All these
could be produced locally in much greater
quantities with extension of cultivation to
new lands and an increase in agricultural
productivity. The capital investment required for further agricultural development considerably exceeds the farmers’
own financial resources and cannot be
carried on without agricultural credit. The
Banco provides this credit and also comprehensive technical services in the course
of its operations. Since Bank assistance
began in 1954, the Banco has made over
14,400 medium and long-term loans to
some 6,000 farmers. It is estimated that
the gross value of increased production on
farms which had received credit amounted
to $44 million in 1963. The three-year program being assisted by this loan will require the equivalent of $30.4 million.
Participations totaling $750,000: by
Meadow Brook National Bank, FidelityPhiladelphia Trust Company, First Wisconsin National Bank of Milwaukee, National
Bank of Detroit, The Philadelphia National
Bank, The First Pennsylvania Banking and
Trust Company, First Western Bank and

New York, and The Northern Trust
Company.

AGRICULTURE—LAND DEVELOPMENT
AND SETTLEMENT

$11 million 20-year 542% Bank loan of
June 18, 1965, to Peru.

The loan will assist the third stage of the
San Lorenzo project for the irrigation and
settlement of once arid land on the coast
of northern Peru—an area which may eventually involve about 125,000 acres. The
project brings together irrigation, farm
credit and a wide range of technical services for the purpose of increasing the output of food and cash crops, both for domestic consumption and export. Besides
raising farm income and improving standards of living in its own area, the San
Lorenzo project is serving as a model for
similar developments in other parts of
Peru.

In the first stage the Government built
works to supplement water from the Piura
River for irrigation. The second stage,
which was assisted by an $18 million Bank
loan, consisted of enlarging these works
for the irrigation, development and settlement of the San Lorenzo area. Since then
about 35,600 acres have been developed
and settled.

The third stage consists of the development and settlement during 1965-67 of
some 44,000 acres and the further improvement of lands already settled. Funds
fram the loan will be made available for
medium and long-term credits to farmers
for on-farm investments which include
land development, housing, machinery,
breeding livestock and tree crops. In addition, the loan will finance the foreign exchange costs of heavy mechanical equipment for the operation and maintenance
of irrigation facilities and service roads and
for the leveling and ditching of land; a
comprehensive drainage and salinity survey of the entire project area; improvement of experiment stations; a training
program for the maintenance of equipment; a study of marketing problems; and
services and equipment for vocational and
artisan schools. Bank funds will also be
used for a study looking toward steps for
the further development of water and related resources in the northwestern region of Peru. The total cost of the project
is estimated to be $29.8 million.

OTHER ACTIVITIES +The Bank's Resident
Representative completed his assignment
in May 1965.

The Bank has agreed to help finance
feasibility studies for three road construction projects at a total estimated cost to
the Bank of $300,000.

A consultant engaged by the Bank carried out a preliminary survey of the capital
market. His report was submitted to the
Government in October 1964.

A19-man mission organized by the Bank
to review the Government’s economic development program and policies completed its field work and is now preparing its
report.

SURINAM

A transport study financed by the United
Nations Special Fund and for which the
Bank is Executing Agency was begun in
December 1964.

The UN Special Fund has authorized a
supplementary allocation of $77,000 to extend the mineral survey for which the Bank
is Executing Agency. The total allocation
for the survey is now $827,000 and the
completion date has been extended to
June 30, 1966.

URUGUAY

AGRICULTURE—LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION
$12.7 million 15-year 544% Bank loan of
March 30, 1965, to Uruguay.

Uruguay's chief natural resource is its extensive area of native grassland which is
used for the production of sheep and cattie. Wool, meat, milk and by-products provide most of the country’s export earnings.
Because of the importance of livestock to
the Uruguayan economy, the Bank made
a loan of $7 million in 1959 for a pilot project to increase production by demonstrating the advantages of modern techniques
of pasture improvementand management.
The three to fourfold increase in livestock
preduction from the improved grasslands
over that of native pastures has attracted
the attention of farmers everywhere in the
country. About 1,400 farmers participated
in the program and improved 360,000
acres of pasture land. In addition, farmers
who cooperated with the program but arranged their own financing, improved an
additional 170,000 acres.

This year’s loan will assist in financing
the second stage of the program which will
require a total investment of $35 million
over a four-year period. In this stage, individually supervised livestock development
loans will provide 650,000 acres of improved pastures on 2,600 medium-sized
farms. In addition, about 1,000 operators
of larger farms are expected to participate
on a cash basis to improve about 310,000
acres. As there are 37 million acres of native grassland capable of similar improvement, the program points the way to profound economic and social consequences
for the nation as a whole. The program is
designed to improve only part of a large
number of farms and not the total area of
a few, so in three years’ time about a
quarter of the grassland farmers of Uru
guay will have the required experience to
continue the development of their own
properties and to extend advice to
neighbors.

VENEZUELA

ELECTRIC POWER

$14 million 20-year 52% Bank loan of
August 28, 1964, to Compaiia Anénima

de Administracién y Fomento

Eléctrico (CADAFE).

CADAFE, a wholly owned subsidiary of the
national development authority, Corporacién Venezolana de Fomento (CVF), was
established in 1958 to extend power facilities to Venezuela’s smaller cities and rural
areas and to manage the separate power
systems acquired by CVF. It now has 14
regional administrations serving some 500
communities and rural areas.

Demand for power in Venezuela is expected to grow at an annual rate of 14%
ever the next five years, and CADAFE is
currently engaged in a program to extend
and increase its service. The Bank joan will
assist in financing an extension of its transmission facilities. A high-voltage transmission line, about 370 miles long, will be
erected to connect the Macagua power
station on the Caroni River with a substation near Caracas, several substations will
be installed, and existing transmission facilities reinforced and interconnected. The
project will enable CADAFE to realize substantial economies by concentrating its
generating activities upon its larger and
more efficient units, by pooling reserve
capacity, and advancing the retirement of
high-cost diesel units in areas to be served
by the interconnected systems. The estimated cost of the project is $19 million.

TRANSPORTATION—ROADS

$30 million 20-year 542% Bank loan of
August 28, 1964, to Venezuela.

This loan will assist in financing two roads,
both of which form part of the trunk highway link between central Venezuela and
the southwestern provinces, and two expressways in the Caracas area. One of the
highways will extend 128 miles from Barinas to La Pedrera and will open up to development a large area with a rich agricultural and forest potential now accessible
only by trails. The other highway will run
65 miles from La Pedrera to San Cristébal,
the marketing and communications center
for southwestern Venezuela; it will also
connect with the road which serves the
State of Apure, the most important cattle
producing region in Venezuela. The expressways will relieve the severe traffic
congestion in Caracas. The foca! point of
the network of the city and suburban expressways in the Caracas area is a fourlevel interchange called ‘'La Arafia” (the
Spider), on the western fringe of downtown
Caracas. The expressways being financed
are two of the four which will converge at
La Arafia. One will be a six-lane divided
highway, 2.4 miles long, and the other will
be a four-lane divided highway 2.7 miles
long. Construction of the four roads is
scheduled for completion in 3*% years ata
total estimated cost of $65 million.

The road system in Venezuela is by far
the most important means of transport.
Since 1947 the public network has been
more than tripled in length and now comprises about 17,500 miles, of which more
than 7,000 miles are paved. The roads being built with the assistance of the Bank
loan are of high priority in the Government’s continuing road development program which calls for an investment of
nearly $600 million in 1965-68.

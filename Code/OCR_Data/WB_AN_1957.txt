Statement of Bank loans, and the customary Appendices, including the
Financial Statements as of June 30, 1957 and the Administrative Budget
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1958.
Sincerely yours,

The period was one of rising interest rates; the
rates charged by the Bank, which are based on the
estimated cost of borrowing by the Bank at the time a
loan is made, therefore also increased. In January the
interest rate on long-term Bank loans, including the
I per cent commission, was raised from 5 to 51/2 per
cent. In May the rate was raised again to 5 5/8 per cent,
the highest yet charged. In view of the sharp rise in the

lower rate on its shorter term loans and adopted a

Tlhe "Sandon IV", a hopper dredge with a capacity of
2,000 cubic meters, was bought with Bank funds to main-
tain the depth in the channel leading to the port of Bangkok,
in Tlhailand. The channel wvas first deepened in 1954 and
now allows access to the harbor by 10,000-ton vessels.
Access to the Port of Bangkok, on the Chao Phya
River, was long impeded by a bar of silt at the river's
mouth. Only ships of less than 4,000 deadweight tons
could reach the harbor; larger vessels had to transfer
cargoes to lighters some 50 miles away in the Gulf of
Thailand. Part of a Bank loan of $4.4 million made in
1950 was used to deepen and widen the channel
through the bar, and since 1954 ships up to 10,000
deadweight tons have been able to reach the port.
The savings in lighterage fees and in the costs of han-
dling cargo have been substantial-an important fac-

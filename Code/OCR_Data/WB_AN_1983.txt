The expression, “The World Bank.”* as used
in this Annual Report, means both the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and its affiliate. the International
Development Association (IDA). The IBRD has
a second affiliate, the International Finance
Corporation (IFC).

The common objective of these institutions is
to help raise standards of living in developing
countries by channeling financial resources from
developed countries to the developing world.

The IBRD, established in 1945. is owned by the
governments of 144 countries. The IBRD. whose
capital is subscribed by its member countries.
finances its lending operations primarily from its
own borrowings in the world capital markets. A
substantial contribution to the IBRD’s resources
also comes from its retained earnings and the flow
of repayments on its loans. IBRD loans generally have a grace period of five years and are
repayable over twenty years or less. They are
directed toward developing countries at moreadvanced stages of economic and social growth.
The interest rate the IBRD charges on its loans
is calculated in accordance with a guideline related
to its cost of borrowing.

The IBRD’s charter spells out certain basic
rules that govern its operations, It must lend only
for productive purposes and must stimulate economic growth in the developing countries where
it lends. It must pay due regard to the prospects
of repayment. Each loan is made to a government or must be guaranteed by the government
concerned. The use of loans cannot be restricted
to purchases in any particular member country.
And the IBRD’s decisions to lend must be based
on economic considerations.

The International Development Association
was established in 1960 to provide assistance for
the same purposes as the IBRD. but primarily in
the poorer developing countries and on terms that
would bear less heavily on their balance of payments than IBRD loans. IDA’s assistance is,
therefore, concentrated on the very poor countries—those with an annual per capita gross
national product of less than $796 (in 1981 dollars). More than fifty countries are eligible under
this criterion.

Membership in IDA is open to all members of
the IBRD and 131 of them have joined to date.

 

 

 

The funds used by IDA, called credits to distinguish them from IBRD loans. come mostly in the
form of subscriptions, general replenishments
from IDA’s more industrialized and developed
members, and transfers from the net earnings of
the IBRD. The terms of IDA credits. which are
made to governments only. are ten-year grace
periods. fifty-year maturities. and no interest. A
small annual service fee is charged on both the
disbursed and undisbursed portions of each credit.
Although legally and financially distinct from the
IBRD, IDA is administered by the same staff.

The IFC was established in 1956. [ts function
is to assist the economic development of lessdeveloped countries by promoting growth in the
private sector of their economies and helping to
mobilize domestic and foreign capital for this
purpose. Membership in the [BRD is a prerequisite for membership in the IFC, which totals [2
countries. Legally and financially, the IFC and the
IBRD are separate entities. The Corporation has
its own operating and legal staff, but draws upon
the Bank for administrative and other services.

While the World Bank has traditionally
financed ali kinds of capital infrastructure such
as roads and railways. telecommunications. and
ports and power facilities, its present development strategy places an emphasis on investments
that can directly affect the well-being of the masses
of poor people of developing countries by making them more productive and by integrating them
as active partners in the development process.

In the last five years, the Bank has stepped up
its lending for energy development. Lending for
power forms the largest part of the Bank’s energy
program, but commitments for oil and gas development have shown the greatest increase.

Since 1980, the Bank, in response to the deteriorated prospects for the developing countries
during the 1980s, inaugurated a program of
structural-adjustment lending. This lending supports programs of specific policy changes and
institutional reforms in developing countries
designed to achieve a more efficient use of
resources and thereby: (a) contribute to a more
sustainable balance of payments in the medium
and long term and to the maintenance of growth
in the face of severe constraints: and (b) lay the
basis for regaining momentum for future growth.4 Contents

910 The Executive Directors and Alternates

The Executive Directors and Altemates

The World Bank has confronted major challenges in the past year. The impetus toward
development in many of its member nations was
more sharply broken than at any time since the
founding of the institution, as the impact of the
deepest recession since the 1930s continued to be
felt in all parts of the world.

The Bank has had to be flexible and imaginative and to respond speedily and effectively to the
needs of the developing nations. It has been a
time, as well, when the Bank has had to be prudent and creative in its financial operations, and
expert in its economic analysis and in the economic advice that it provides.

In this time of economic crisis for numerous
developing countries, the implementation of
development projects of high priority has slowed,
or, inmany cases, stopped, as governments have
attempted to cut back on expenditures.

Thus, during the past year, the Bank responded
to the urgent need to deal with the developmental aspects of the current crisis by fashioning
a temporary program involving financial measures and policy advice designed to help borrowers pursuing appropriate adjustment policies to
take actions to ameliorate the adverse effects on
development of the current global economic
environment. The program will increase Bank
disbursements significantly and will add substantially to the net transfer of Bank resources to
its developing member countries.

If, on the one hand, it is essential that instruments be found that would permit the Bank to be
more responsive to the urgent needs of its borrowers, no less essential is the task of ensuring that
the financial base of the IBRD remains sound.
Only through maintenance of a sound financial
base can the institution respond with flexibility
and imagination on behalf of its borrowers. Thus,
during the past year, a new lending-rate formula

was agreed upon that reduces the IBRD’s exposure to interest-rate risks. New borrowing techniques were approved, as well.

The transfer of resources to developing countries is only one—albeit the most visible—aspect
of the Bank’s developmental role. Its role as a
partner in the dialogue with governments on
overall economic policy and sectoral strategies,
and as a source of technical assistance and advice
is as important as its role as a lender. The deterioration in the economic climate in many of the
Bank’s developing member countries has
increased the importance, as well as the visibility. of this advisory function.

The Bank responded to the increased need for
nonfinancial assistance in the past year in several
ways. These have included increases in staff time
spent on country economic and sectoral analyses, restructuring its staff college, the Economic Development Institute, so as to enable it
to respond more effectively to the training needs
of the developing countries, undertaking a new
program of seconding advisers to the very poorest of its members, continuing the redirection of
its research program, and other measures.

Despite these efforts, which are described in
more detail throughout the body of the Annual
Report, it has proved to be difficult for the Bank
to respond adequately to the needs of the very
poorest developing countries. Operations have
proceeded under considerable uncertainty concerning the resources available to the International Development Association.

The number of IDA credits approved in the past
fiscal year was considerably lower than had been
expected when the sixth replenishment of its
resources was agreed upon in October 1979. Itis
generally accepted that IDA is an effective institution. There is now an urgent need to place [DA
ona secure and sustainable footing so that coun-tries eligible for IDA assistance by virtue of three
main criteria—poverty (as measured by per capita income), limited creditworthiness for borrowing from conventional sources, and economic
performance (including an ability to make effective use of resources and the availability of suitable projects)—can continue to have access to
resources. Certainty about the levels of credits
that it can make in the years ahead will enhance
stability in the planning of its operations. The IDA
process can do more and, at this time of crisis in
the poorest nations, it should do more.

The World Bank: Fiscal 1983, in Brief

In fiscal year 1983,' lending commitments by
the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) and by the International
Development Association (IDA), together with
investment commitments by the International
Finance Corporation (IFC), totaled $15,322 million. In the previous year, lending and investment commitments had been $13,628 million.

The increase, of $1,694 million, was the result
mainly of record lending levels—$11,136 million, or an increase of $806 million (8 percent)
over fiscal 1982—by the IBRD. Commitments by
IDA increased $655 million, or 24 percent, to
$3,341 million.

Investments by the IFC were $845 million, up
$233 million, or 38 percent. from fiscal 1982 totals.

A total of 136 IBRD loans were approved during the year to forty-three countries. One hundred
seven IDA credits to forty-four countries were
approved. IFC’s fifty-eight investment commitments were spread out over thirty-six countries.

Brazil. Indonesia, and India were the most
active IBRD borrowers during the past year.
Commitments to those countries totaled $1,458
million (seven projects), $1,330 million (twelve
projects), and $1,088 million (eight projects),
respectively. The most active IDA borrowers were
India ($1.063 million for seven projects), Bangladesh ($367 million for seven projects), and
Pakistan ($229 million for five projects).

IBRD loans and IDA credits helped finance
about 34 percent of the cost of projects for which
total amounts can be calculated.

Ata glance, these are the other major operational] and financial highlights of fiscal year 1983:

© The IBRD’s net income was a record $752
million, up $154 million. or 26 percent, over fiscal 1982;

© Borrowings by the IBRD totaled $10,292
million, exceeding the previous year’s amount,
$8,521 million, by $1,771 million, or 21 percent.
The IBRD was most active in borrowing US dollars ($3,537 million), Swiss francs ($2,514 million), Deutsche mark ($1,519 million), Japanese
yen ($1,326 million), and Netherlands guilders
($811 million);

© Disbursements by the IBRD were $6,817
million. IDA disbursements stood at $2,596 million. Disbursements for the IBRD and IDA in

fiscal 1982 were $6,326 million and $2,067 million, respectively;

@ The net transfer of resources by the IBRD
and IDA was $4.498 million, up $142 million, or
3 percent, over fiscal 1982. The net transfer of
resources is defined as disbursements minus
repayment of principal, interest, and other
charges;

© There was an increase in the subscribed capital of the IBRD in the amount of SDR9,237 million, of which SDR8,563 million was the result of
subscriptions authorized by the general capital
increase approved in January 1980;

@ In fiscal 1983, eighty-eight IBRD and IDA
projects, or 35 percent of total operations,
involved cofinancing funds totaling $5,690.4
million.

IDA

The Sixth Replenishment of the International
Development Association (IDA6) was negotiated at a level of SDR9.15 billion (USS12 billion) at exchange rates of October 5, 1979. It was
envisaged that these contributions would be
committed in the periad, fiscal 1981-83. However, legislative delays in the United States and
a Subsequent reduction in its appropriations for
IDA6 resulted in: (a) a thirteen-month delay in
the effectiveness of IDA6: (b) a substantial
reduction in IDA’s operational program for the
period, fiscal 1982-84: and (c) a delay in the start
of negotiations for the Seventh Replenishment
of the Association (IDA7).

At the beginning of fiscal 1983, a meeting of
IDA Deputies was held in The Hague, the Netherlands (July 5-6, 1982), to review the status o:
IDA’s commitment authority; to discuss specia
arrangements that could result in an increase in
IDA’s commitment authority in fiscal 1983 and
fiscal 1984; and to address other important issues,
such as the prospects for starting discussions on
IDA7.

The central issue addressed by the Deputies at
that meeting concerned the prevention of a large
gap from emerging in resources available to IDA
in fiscal 1984. IDA7 was originally expected to
have become effective in that fiscal year: uncertainties regarding the US contributions for IDA6
resulted in a deferral of these negotiations. In the
absence of action by donors. there would have
arisen a marked decline in the commitment level
for fiscal 1984, since only the US contribution and
small balances from donors not releasing their
contributions in full would have been available
for lending. Deputies, therefore, studied different options to ensure that IDA’s flow of annual
commitments was maintained at appropriate
levels in fiscal 1984—the year between the concluding stages of IDA6 and the beginning of IDA7.

These discussions were continued at the next
meeting of the Deputies in Toronto, Canada (on
September 4 through 8, 1982),* where donors,
other than the United States, agreed to provide
Special Contributions in an amount, in general,
equivalent to one-third of their total contributions to IDA6 through either an “FY84 Account”
ora ‘Special Fund.” It was agreed that these two
schemes should be operated in parallel, permitting donors to choose whichever mechanism they
felt would accommodate their concerns and
facilitate approval for such special contributions
in their respective legislatures. It is expected that
these contributions will provide IDA additional
commitment authority in fiscal 1984 of about
SDR1.8 billion ($1.9 billion).

FY84 Account. Contributions to the FY84
Account add to the general resources of IDA and

 

carry voting rights (unless deferred). Twelve
donors, whose special contributions account for
SDR1.2 billion, or about 65 percent of the total
amount to be provided in fiscal 1984, have, so far,
decided to make their contributions through this
account. Included in this group are the Federal
Republic of Germany, Japan, and the United
Kingdom.

Special Fund. Contributions to the Special Fund
constitute a fund separate from IDA’s other
resources. Since amounts repaid by borrowers for
credits financed by the Fund would, at the time
of repayment, flow back into IDA’s general
resources, voting rights could be provided on
account of these reflows at that time. Procurement eligibility is restricted to contributors, Part
II countries, and contributors to the FY84
Account who have agreed that their contributions be treated in the same manner as Special
Fund contributions for the purposes of any future
adjustment of voting rights. Six countries (Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, and Sweden) have, to date, decided to contribute SDR465
million, or about 25 percent of total special contributions. France has decided to advance a part
of its Special Fund contributions—representing
the equivalent of its IDA6 release beyond the pro
rata level—to fiscal 1983.

Fourteen other donors, whose special contributions account for about 10 percent of the total,
had not, as of June 30, 1983, chosen the vehicle
for their special contributions.

Deputies recognized that these special-contribution arrangements were interim in nature. and
reiterated the urgency of beginning negotiations
on IDA7 as soon as possible. Thus, negotiations
for the Seventh Replenishment of the International Development Association were launched
with a meeting of IDA Deputies in Washington,
DC, on November 22-23, 1982. The meeting was

? Concurrent with that meeting. a report. entitled /DA in Retrospect, was published for the Bank. The report comprehensively reviewed IDA’s work over the past wo decades, It noted
that IDA had committed $27 billion in morc than 1,300 projects in seventy-eight countries since 1960, Details were given
of specific projects and programs assisted by IDA—failures
as well ag successes. The broad analysis reached several conclusions:

+ Twenty-seven nations. once cligible for IDA credits on the

basis of their weak economies, have developed to the state at

which they can finance further growth on conventional borrowing terms.

+ Dramatic increases in agricultural production in South Asia,

where IDA has been particularly active, have sharply reduced

the need for massive food imports in the region and. in India's
case, have resulted in virtual self-sufficiency.

+ IDA lending has been effective in promoting development.

+ IDA has gained a vast amount of understanding by “doing.”

including learning from past mistakes,

+ IDA has been remarkably successful in attracting financial

support.

+ IDA has a key role to play in mecting the needs for conces
sional aid to the poorest countriesIDA Special Contributions, by Donor and Vehicle*

opened by A. W. Clausen, the Association’s
Chairman and President, who stressed the
importance of these negotiations. He noted that
their outcome would have a profound bearing on
the lives of several hundred million people in the
poorest developing countries. on influencing the
trend of global multilateral economic cooperation, and specifically, on the future course of the
World Bank. In view of the urgent needs facing

 

the poorest and weakest members of the world
community, whose economic prospects had been
damaged severely by factors beyond their control, he stressed the importance of achieving a real
increase in the resources provided under IDA7.
In particular, the concessional-resource needs of
IDA-recipient countries had increased substantially because of a number of factors, among them
the need for reversing prolonged economic18 The World Bank: Fiscal 1983, in Brief

decline in sub-Saharan Africa, the continued
needs of other poor countries in South Asia, the
Caribbean, and elsewhere. and China’s need for
concessionary assistance.

The main item for consideration at the
November meeting was terms and conditions of
IDA credits. Subsequent to this meeting, Deputies met on two other occasions over the course
of the fiscal year: in Paris, France (February 1983),
to discuss IDA’s allocation criteria and in
Copenhagen, Denmark (March 1983). to discuss
burden-sharing arrangements for IDA7. Deputies are scheduled to meet again in July 1983 in
Tokyo, Japan. to continue their deliberations on
the Seventh Replenishment. They will address
issues related to the size and implementation
arrangements for the Seventh Replenishment—
including conditions of effectiveness, methods of
payments, maintenance of value, and voting
rights. It is expected that negotiations will have
reached a concluding stage by the end of calendar year 1983.

Fiscal 1983 commitment authority. The United
States was expected to have provided a third
installment of $945 million in fiscal 1983. However, on December 1, 1982, an installment of $700
million, as authorized by the Continuing Resolution, was made available to the Association.
This contribution, together with other donors’
IDA6 releases, the Special Fund contribution
advanced by France, and IDA’s other resources,
resulted in a level of commitment authority for
fiscal 1983 of about SDR3.1 billion, or $3.3 billion.

Cofinancing

Over the past decade, there has been a steady
increase in cofinancing with the World Bank. The
number of operations with cofinancing has
increased from an average of fifty-eight in the
period fiscal 1974-76 to an average of eighty-nine
in the period fiscal 1981-83. In recent years, official cofinancing and export-credit cofinancing
have been running at an annual average of around
$2,000 million, and the financing plans of IBRD
operations at the time of their approval by the
Executive Directors show a build-up in the
involvement of private-sector cofinancers from
an average of less than $300 million a year in fiscal 1974-76 to an average of between $1,500 million and $2,000 million a year in the period 198183. (See cofinancing tables on page 19.)

At the same time, however, it should be noted
that while official cofinancing is usually firmly
arranged at the time of Board approval of a Bank
project (the poorest countries, requiring concessionary resources, do not proceed on the basis of
uncertain financing plans), export-credit and
commercial-bank financing are often not required
until the implementation stage of a project. Such
financing may well be arranged a year or two after

a Bank loan has been approved by the Board. The
statistics in the accompanying table refer, therefore, to financing plans at the time of Board
approval rather than actual operations, and may,
particularly in the case of export credit and private cofinancing, be subject to later modification.

The general trend in cofinancing continues to
show an overall rise; however, fluctuations can
be expected from year to year. These fluctuations, particularly with respect to private and
export-credit cofinancing, can be a reflection of
a number of factors, among them the composition of the Bank’s lending operations and the
volatility of market conditions. Both factors
played a role in the drop in operations involving
private cofinancing in fiscal 1983. By contrast,
cofinancing with export credits grew substantially in the number of operations and in the
amounts committed during fiscal 1982 and fiscal
1983, as compared with the rather low level of
fiscal 1981. The unusually high figure for 1983 is
due to some very large operations.

A discussion of new cofinancing instruments,
designed to attract more cofinancing from private sources, begins on page 38.

In support of the Bank’s objective of continuing the expansion of its cofinancing operations
with private banks, export-credit agencies, and
public sources of finance, the position of Vice
President, Cofinancing, was established in February 1983. Its purpose is to develop relationships with cofinancers, to assist in the formulation
and implemenation of cofinancing policies, and
to provide guidance to managers with line
responsibility for operations. Another step to
strengthen the Bank's organization in the area of
cofinancing has been the designation of a Cofinancing Coordinator in the office of each of the
six Regional Vice Presidencies, The regional
Cofinancing Coordinators work closely with the
regional staff and the staff of the Advisory Unit
for Cofinancing on all matters relating to cofinancing,

Disbursements

The volume of annual disbursements on project lending is influenced by a variety of factors
such as the complexity of projects, economic
conditions in the borrowing countries, availability of expertise, the size of undisbursed balances
on approved loans and credits. and the sector and
age of the undisbursed balances. However, once
again in fiscal 1983, agriculture absorbed the
highest proportion of IBRD disbursements at 23
percent of the total, followed by transportation,
power, and industrial development, with 15 percent, 13 percent, and 10 percent, respectively. For
IDA, agriculture, at 39 percent of the fiscal 1983
total disbursed, was also the highest sector, fol-Bank Management and Staff 19

Bank Management and Staff

At June 30, 1983, total staff of the Bank
(including staff on leave without pay. but who are
still on Bank rolls) numbered 5,587, of whom
2,821 were higher-level staff representing 106
nationalities. It was a year of limited staff growth.
The number of higher-level staff grew at a rate of
0.1 percent, compared with 5.3 percent in the
previous fiscal year.

Efforts to increase the proportion of women
and underrepresented nationalities continued,

with particularly encouraging results in the Young
Professionals Program. Although only one
selection took place in fiscal 1983, 70 percent of
those appointed are nationals of developing
countries. Twenty-six percent are Africans and
39 percent of the total are women.

Special attention was given during the past year
to assisting managers in carrying out their personnel-management functions and to make optimum use of their resources. A number of
initiatives affecting both managers and staff were
introduced or implemented:

(a) Introduction of a new performanceappraisal system, called ‘‘Performance Planning
and Review” (PPR), began. It calls for man-20. The World Bank: Fiscal 1983. in Brief

agers and staff to set annual work objectives that
are later used to assess performance. and to plan
for staff training and development. The system
was begun in May 1983 with performance planning by Vice Presidents.

(b) A revised reward system went into effect
in May 1983. It aims to provide greater incentives for performance by giving managers more
flexibility and scope to reward those who contribute more. It should also do away with past
automaticity in granting pay increases by differentiating more for performance.

(c) Work began on the grading of jobs in the
Bank, with the evaluation of some 450 benchmark positions at all levels. They provide the
framework for evaiuating the remaining 5.000
jobs. The results of the grading survey will be
implemented in late fiscal 1984.

(d) Implementation of a Human Resources
Information System (HRS) continued during the
past year. It permitted, among other things, the
launching of a project to develop computerized
staff profiles that will assist in making more
effective use of the abundant talent throughout
the Bank.

(e) Follow-up to the Attitude Survey conducted in fiscal 1982 was carried out throughout
the Bank, at both the unit and institutional level.
After the results of the Survey were discussed with
all staff members, managers in the institution
formulated plans to bring about improvements.
Senior management also discussed actions to be
taken to meet issues of institutional concern arising from the Survey.

(f) A proposal for an integrated managementdevelopment training program. endorsed by
senior management, is in its final stage of development. Implementation will take place over the
next three vears.

 

Robert S. McNamara Fellowships

Ten Robert §. McNamara fellowships were
awarded to twelve scholars during the past year—
the first to be granted under a program set up in
fiscal 1982 to honor the former President of the
World Bank.

The fellowships are intended primarily for fulltime study or research at the postgraduate level
in fields related to economic development. It is
intended that the research be imaginative and
innovative: in addition. the work is not normally
to be such as would lead to a postgraduate degree.

The first fellows come from Canada, Denmark, Ecuador (two). Guyana, India (two). Ivory
Coast. Senegal, the United Kingdom. the United
States. and Zaire. The youngest is thirty years old.
the oldest, thirty-seven. All will work in countries other than their own. The total amount of
the first year’s awards was $187,500.

McNamara fellowships are financed from the

 

income of an endowment fund. Bangladesh,
China, India, Kuwait, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru,
and Yugoslavia have contributed $1.9 million to
this fund. The Bank has contributed $1 million.

Fellowship applications for the 1984 academic
year will be received and screened by the Economic Development Institute. Selections will be
made by a panel appointed by the Executive
Directors on the recommendation of the management of the Bank.

Membership

Hungary became a member of the IBRD on
July 7, 1982, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines
joined the IBRD and IDA on August 30, 1982,
bringing the total membership to [44 for the
IBRD and to 131 for IDA.

At the end of the year, action was pending on
membership in the IBRD for Antigua. Barbuda,
and Malta and in IDA for Portugal.

IFC

The International Finance Corporation is the
affiliate of the IBRD that was established in 1956
to supplement the Bank’s activities by promoting and providing support for the private sector
in developing member countries. With the
authority to make equity investments and to
provide loans without government guarantees.
the Corporation can provide the type of financing and investment expertise particularly suited
to attracting and lending confidence to private
investors.

Even though it operates with its own staff and
capital, IFC—through joint ventures. by building upon the World Bank's infrastructural
achievements, or through the sharing of purposes and policies—works closely with the Bank
towards the common goal of promoting economic development in member countries.

IFC’s role is to stimulate the flow of private
capital into productive private and mixed private/public enterprises—not to replace it. Thus,
IFC operates as a catalyst in bringing together
entrepreneurship, investment capital. and production.

In addition to providing its own funds, the
Corporation seeks to raise financing. either
directly. through the syndication of its own loans,
or, indirectly, by helping to attract parallel
financing from international capital markets.

One important feature that distinguishes IFC
from commercial financial institutions is its commitment to provide project sponsors with the
necessary technical assistance which will help
ensure that their ventures are potentially productive and financially sound,

In addition. the Corporation provides policy
assistance to its member governments in support
of their efforts to develop the necessary invest-ment climate that will encourage productive and
beneficial domestic and foreign investment.

Recognizing the important contributions of
financial markets to economic development, IFC
has a specialized department that is the focal point
of the capital market-development activities of
IFC and the World Bank. The department provides specialized resources for addressing the
financial-market needs and problems of developing countries.

Projects approved. In spite of the global economic difficulties which severely reduced
domestic capital expenditures and foreign direct
investment, the dollar volume of investments
approved by IFC’s Board of Directors increased
38 percent from $611.8 million in fiscal 1982 to
$844.5 million. Of the total approved, $55.3 million for equity investments in forty-one
companies, compared with $32.3 million the
previous year.

The Corporation raised $418.9 million through
the syndication of its loans with international
financial institutions. About $187.6 million was
syndicated the previous year. Some twenty-six
private and public institutions took up participations in IFC’s loans.

A total of fifty-eight projects, with project costs
of §2,894.1 million, were approved by the Board
in thirty-six developing countries. About 38 percent of these were in countries with a per capita
income of less than $731. Sixteen projects (28
percent) of the projects were in Africa, sixteen
(28 percent) in Asia, nineteen (32 percent) in
Latin America and the Caribbean, and seven (12
percent) in Europe and the Middle East.

IFC continued to broaden its investment
activities. Manufacturing, which in the past
accounted for about two-thirds of the number of
projects, was Jess than one-third of the total.
Twenty-four percent of the projects were in agribusiness, 12 percent in mining, and 22 percent in
financial institutions.

Disbursements of $374.4 million were lower
than the previous year by $155.8 million. Of this
total. $342.9 million was for loans, including
amounts disbursed for participants in IFC loans,
and $31.5 million was for equity. Repayments and
sales were $124.6 million; net disbursements,
therefore, were $249.8 million.

Financial results. Interest and dividend income
equaled $122.4 million, and an additional $5.1
million in capital gains was received from the sale
of equity investments. While up slightly from last
year’s levels, total operating income of $137.4
million clearly reflected the difficulties faced by
a number of companies in IFC's portfolio.

Recognizing the severity of the business climate and the potential effects of the weakening
economic conditions, the Corporation added
$25.7 million to its Reserve Against Losses. About

 

 

ICSID 21

$10.1 million of investments were written off
during the year. This brought the Reserve to $99.6
million, or 7.4 percent of the total outstanding
portfolio, which is considered adequate.

Net earnings of $23.0 million, compared with
$21.6 million in the previous year, were added to
accumulated earnings, which brought that total
to $203.8 million.

Portfolio. IFC’s investment portfolio is well
diversified in terms of both industry and country. At the end of the year, the Corporation's
investment portfolio held for its own account
(including undisbursed balances) was $1.881.9
million, up $46.9 million from the previous year.
In addition. $1,122.7 million was being held and
administered for participants in IFC financing.

Capital increase. August 1. 1982, was the terminal date for subscriptions and payments to the
capital increase approved by IFC’s Board of
Governors in November 1977. Of the 106 member countries to which 468.800 shares ($468.8
million) were allocated. eighty-three of these had
subscribed and paid-in a total of $420.3 million
by the terminal date. Seven countries. representing an additional $1.8 million worth of shares,
were granted a payment extension. Subsequent
to the terminal date, five countries subscribed to
$8.2 million worth of shares that had been allocated but not subscribed by others.

Borrowings. The Corporation borrowed $145
million equivalent from the World Bank during
the year. This was only slightly more than onethird of the total borrowed during the previous
year, which, in part, was a reflection of the lower
level of disbursements made during fiscal 1982 and
the business slowdown in fiscal 1983.

The Corporation continued the practice initiated the previous year of providing more funds
in currencies other than US dollars. A total of
$111.6 million equivalent was allocated in
Deutsche mark, French francs, Netherlands
guilders, Pounds sterling. and Swiss francs.
Equivalent funds were borrowed from the World
Bank.

New members, During the year. Maldives and
Guinea took up membership in IFC. This brought
the total membership to 124 countries.

The IFC's Annual Report provides details of its
activities.

ICSID

The International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (ICSID) is an international
institution created in 1965 by the Convention on
the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of Other States (the Convention). The purpose of ICSID is to provide
facilities for conciliation and arbitration of
investment disputes between Contracting States
and nationals of other Contracting States in22 The World Bank: Fiscal 1983, in Brief

accordance with the provisions of the Convention.

Contracting States are member States of the
IBRD and any other State party to the Statute of
the International Court of Justice which have
signed and ratified the Convention.

On January 7, 1983. Paraguay became the first
Latin American State to adhere to the Conven
tion. On June 22, 1983, Israel deposited its
Instruments of Ratification, bringing the total of
the Contracting States to eighty-three. The

The Economic Scene: A Global Perspective

The continuing recession in the industrial world
severely constrained developing countries’ growth
in 1982. The drop in industrial-country demand
resulted in declines in both the prices and volumes of developing countries’ primary exports.
Restrictive monetary policies. pursued in a number of industrial countries to control inflation,
maintained interest rates at high levels, greatly
increasing developing countries’ service payments on floating-rate debt. Weakness in the price
of oil created difficulties for oil-exporting developing countries. This combination of declines in
export receipts and increases in interest payments created severe balance-of-payments
problems. A number of countries were unable to
meet their payments on foreign debt, and many
had to pursue severely contractionary policies to
contain their current-account deficits. Performance varied considerably in the developing world,
but most countries experienced lower growth rates
compared with those in the 1970s, while some
suffered absolute declines in gross domestic
product (GDP).

It appears that growth in the major industrial
countries will become positive again in 1983
(compared to -0.2 percent in 1982), which should
increase the demand for developing countries*
exports, Interest rates have declined since mid1982, although they remain unusually high in
relation to inflation, The decline in oil prices will
hurt developing countries that rely heavily on oil
exports, although some of the major borrowers
in this group will be aided by lower interest rates.
Oil-importing countries will benefit from lower
oil prices and lower interest rates. at the same time
that the prices of some of their primary exports
are showing signs of an upturn. These factors
should ease developing countries’ external constraints somewhat in 1983, although most countries (particularly those with high levels of
commercial debt) will have to continue painful
adjustment programs. It is likely that developing
countries’ growth in 1983 will still be considerably less than the average for the 1970s, and perhaps less than the increase in population.

 

 

 

Developments in Industrial Countries
Major industrial countries! continued to pursue restrictive monetary policies to restrain
inflation in 1982. As a result, most suffered either
reductions in GDP or very low rates of growth.

GDP declined in the United States, Germany, and
Canada. while in most European countries. it
stagnated. The growth of output was below the
growth of population in most countries, and
industrial production fell sharply. Japan was the
only major developed country that exceeded a
GDP growth rate of 2 percent, but even in that
country, growth remained far below the average
of the 1970s.

The cost of the recession was very high. The
average unemployment rate reached 9 percent in
the second haif of 1982, with over 32 million persons looking for work, the highest level of unemployment since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The rate of bankruptcies increased sharply in both
Europe and the United States. while capacity
utilization declined, by over 11 percent in the case
of US manufacturing. On the other hand. significant gains were made against inflation, which
(measured by the GDP deflator in national currencies) dropped to 7.2 percent in 1982. The
United Kingdom and the United States reduced
their rates of price increases considerably in 1982:
in countries with low inflation rates (such as Japan
and Germany), the situation remained roughly
unchanged. Restrictive monetary policies reduced
inflation. and the recession contributed to moderating wage claims. Reduced demand was a
major factor in the plunge of nonoil-commodity
prices and in the weakening of the price of oil,
which further contributed to slowing price
increases.

Preliminary estimates for 1983 indicate that
growth in the United States may increase significantly. Europe will also record an increase in
GDP. but the rate is likely to be somewhat more
modest than in the US. Industrial countries as a
group are expected to grow at about 2 percent. a
considerably higher rate than in either of the last
three years, but well below the average for the
period following a recession. For example. growth
in industrial countries was 5 percent in 1976 tollowing the recession of 1974-75. Slight improvements in unemployment rates are also expected
in a number of countries.

1980 1981Movements in exchange rates in 1982 complicated economic management in industrial countries. The dollar continued its strong appreciation
against other currencies; a trade-weighted index
of the dollar exchange rate adjusted for inflation
differentials increased by almost 20 percent over
the 1981 average. The resulting decline in US
import prices helped to moderate inflation in that
country, while the increase in the foreign-currency price of US exports made them less competitive in world markets and contributed to
deepening the recession in the US. Other countries may have been forced to pursue policies more
contractionary than they otherwise would have
been in view of the inflationary impact of their
depreciating currencies. The benefit to Europe
and Japan from the gain in competitiveness of
their exports was vitiated somewhat by the
extremely low level of economic activity in the
United States and pressures for restrictions on
imports.

Developing Countries

Developing countries suffered severely from
the prolonged recession, as most aspects of their
external environment continued to worsen in
1982. Low growth in industrial countries reduced
demand for exports of developing countries, while
restrictive monetary policies were accompanied
by interest rates well above inflation rates. As a
result, the prices and volumes of developing
countries’ exports fell, and their debt-service
payments increased. The high cost of borrowing
reduced their demand for private funds, while the
commercial banks limited the flow of private
capital to most developing countries as a result
of their concern over high levels of exposure and
reduced prospects for growth. Many developing
countries were forced into severely contractionary policies to lower imports and contain the
increase in their current-account deficits. Stagnation or decline, at least in per capita terms, was
widespread.

Growth in the oil-importing developing countries decreased slightly from the already poor
performance in 1981. The GDP of Latin American oil-importing countries declined by 3.3 percent in per capita terms, following a 4.5 percent
decline in 1981. Most other oil-importing countries achieved little improvement or actual
declines in per capita income. The major exceptions were East Asian countries, which achieved
high rates of growth compared with most other
countries, Their more flexible economies enabled them to cope better with the adverse international environment—despite their dependence
on trade. Even these countries. however, saw
their growth reduced in 1982 well below its historical trend, as a result of debt problems and
reduced demand for their manufactured exports.

Developing Countries 25

A few other countries (such as Jordan and Turkey), which have adopted more flexible economic policies, also achieved rates of growth well
above the average for developing countries. Lowincome countries in Asia maintained respectable
growth rates, as India’s and China’s large domestic
markets provided some insulation from the
recession. India, however, suffered from a poor
monsoon, which reduced agricultural production and growth in exports. Most alarming was the
continued economic stagnation in low-income
Africa, where GDP has declined steadily in per
capita terms since the early 1970s.

Many oil-exporting countries also suffered from
a severe reduction in growth rates in 1982, as oil
prices weakened and volumes of exports stagnated. Many of these countries resorted to import
restrictions in order to contain their balance-ofpayments deficits. A number of oil-exporting
countries had high levels of debt as a result of large
borrowings—contracted when oil prices were
increasing—to finance ambitious development
plans. Falling oil revenues in 1982 created severe
economic, and in some cases, social. problems.

Although exact statistics are hard to obtain.
lower growth in the developing countries has
undoubtedly resulted in increases in unemployment and underemployment. and hence additional poverty. In some countries, particularly in
the more developed parts of Latin America, the
recession has caused the progress made during the
1970s to be abruptly interrupted. In others, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, the recession has
accelerated the decline in living standards that
began in the 1970s. While this analysis must
inevitably be presented in terms of rather dry
statistics, for many communities. the current
“cyclical downturn” is. in reality, a tragedy of no
small proportion. Emergence from this condition for these countries will be a slow process.

Nonoil-commodity prices. The dollar prices of
most nonoil commodities declined again in 1982,
after falling steeply in 1981. Industrial production in the developed countries dropped by 4
percent, reducing the demand for the primary
materials exported by many developing countries. At the same time, high interest rates
increased the cost of holding inventories. while
lower inflation lessened the attractiveness of
commodities as hedges against inflation. further
reducing demand. As a result, the prices of minerals, metals, fibers, timber, and rubber were
sharply lower than in 1981.

Among the metals, the demand for copper, iron
ore, aluminum, and lead fell steeply. The price
of copper dropped by 15 percent in 1982. despite
extensive production cutbacks in the United
States. Reduced demand for capital goods. consumer goods, and construction reduced the price
of aluminum, while decreased purchases of lead26 The Economic Scene: A Global Perspective

resulted from the decline in the production of
automobiles, which use Jead for batteries. Despite
the reduction in demand, the price of iron ore
actually increased, as it is tied to long-term contracts negotiated in the beginning of the year. At
that time, a substantial recovery in industrial
production was anticipated in 1982, so there was
a modest increase in price over 1981. The prices
of agricultural raw materials, such as jute and
cotton, were also lower. as a result of declines in
demand and favorable harvests. Cotton prices
have been particularly depressed since the record
harvest late in 1981.

The price of foodstuffs declined substantially
in 1982, as excellent weather in several parts of
the world produced record or near-record crops.
Cocoa stocks remained high owing to five consecutive years of oversupply. Coffee-export
quotas, adopted by the International Coffee
Agreement in September, helped to restrain the
reduction in price, although stocks remained at
high levels. Wheat production increased slightly
in 1982 over the high level of 1981. and prices fell
despite the poor harvest in the Soviet Union. Last
year’s increased rice production led to a reduction in prices of about 38 percent. While higher
production over the past two years has greatly
eased the world’s food situation and alleviated the
threat of famine in a number of areas, the resulting price declines have seriously reduced farm
ers’ incomes. A number of the poorer developing
countries have seen their foreign-exchange
receipts drop substantially, severely worsening
their economic prospects.

On the average, the dollar price of nonoil
commodities exported by developing countries
fell 13.2 percent in 1982, with particularly severe
reductions in sugar, rice, and groundnuts, the unit
value of which, in each case, declined by 35 percent or more. The average price of commodities
exported by industrial countries. such as wheat.
maize, and sorghum, have not declined quite as
steeply during the current recession as the prices
of developing countries’ primary exports. While
the export prices of developing countries’ commodities dropped by 25 percent over 1980-82, the
prices of primary exports from industrial countries declined by only about 12.5 percent. The
most recent data indicate that commodity prices
began to increase slightly in early 1983, as a result
of a reduction in stocks of some commodities,
lower interest rates (which encourage the maintenance of higher inventories), and expectations
of a recovery in economic activity in the United
States, which would increase demand.

Commodity price agreements. International
commodity agreements with market-intervention powers are currently in force for five commodities (cocoa, coffee, natural rubber. sugar,
and tin). Their influence over prices during 198228 The Economic Scene: A Global Perspective

 

was mixed. The Coffee Agreement, with the most
restrictive controls over trading activities of
members, appears to have been most successful
in preventing price declines. Coffee prices rose,
on the average, during 1982. The agreements that
rely on buffer-stock activities to stabilize prices
(cocoa, rubber, and tin), experienced difficulties
in gaining access to funds to buy into the buffer
stock in the face of downward pressure on prices.
However, the International Tin Council was able
to invoke export restraints on producers to support its buffer-stock activities, and tin prices fell
only about 8 percent. By contrast, cocoa and
rubber prices fell 16 percent and 19 percent,
respectively.

Oil prices. The market for oil has been subject
to considerable uncertainty over the past year.
The average price of internationally traded oil
declined by 4 percent in 1982 owing to increased
supply and reduced demand. reflecting the impact
of the higher relative price of oil since 1973 and
short-term cyclical factors. From 1973 to 1981, the
dollar price of oil increased significantly relative
to the average prices of manufactured goods and
other primary commodities. This increase in its
relative price led to efforts to reduce the consumption of petroleum products and to find substitute energy sources.

One reflection of this process has been the
decline in oil consumption in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) over the past
decade. From 1973 to 1981. oil consumption
declined from 39.2 million barrels a day to 35.5
million barrels a day. This trend appears to have
accelerated in 1982. Part of the recent decline,
however, may be attributable to the recession.
which has greatly affected some of the manufacturing industries that make intensive use of oil.
By contrast, oi] consumption in developing
countries was reduced by very little over the same
period. The industrial countries were able to
achieve greater savings, both because they relied
less on energy price controls than did the developing countries (particularly the oil exporters).
and because industrial countries could reduce oil
consumption through implementation of broadbased measures, while developing countries had
less flexibility. The ratio of total energy consumption to GDP also declined between 1973 and
1981 in the industrial countries, indicating that the
reaction to the oil-price rise involved both
reduction in energy use and substitution among
energy sources. Efforts at conservation and substitution can be expected to continue, as the capital stock is slowly modified and replaced to reflect

can take many years to work itself out.

The increase in price has also spurred the search
for new oil deposits, and has made relatively highcost oil fields (such as in the North Sea and
Alaska) profitable. A number of countries have
emerged as significant oil exporters since the oilprice increase of 1973-74. One indication of this
is that the share of the Organization of PetroJeum Exporting Countries (OPEC)? in total oil
production dropped from over 67 percent in 1973
to about 47 percent by the third quarter of 1982.
This decline reflects both a 42 percent decline in
OPEC production and a 40 percent increase in oil
production by non-OPEC sources, in particular.
Mexico and the United Kingdom.

The recession has accentuated the longer-term
trend towards lower oil demand. The use of oil
as an intermediate good in industry has declined
significantly. Inventories of oi] in OECD countries were reduced considerably, partially as a
result of high interest rates, which increased the
opportunity cost of holding inventories in general, and partially because of an anticipated drop
in price. The mild winter of 1982 further lowered
the demand for oil, relative to earlier years. Supply conditions also increased the pressure on
official prices, as a result of the recovery of production in [ran.

These long-term and cyclical factors resulted
in a decline in oil prices in 1982. While the official benchmark price of $34 a barrel for Saudi
Arabian light marker crude did not change
throughout the year, the spot-market price
remained below the benchmark, falling under $30.
a barrel in early 1982 before recovering later in
the year. The appreciation of the dollar during
1982 may have compensated some oil exporters
for lower prices by increasing the purchasing
power of their dollar receipts in non-US markets. Conversely, oil importers whose export
prices are not tied to the dollar may have experienced an increase in the cost of oil relative to
their export receipts. In the first quarter of 198
OPEC introduced a production-allocation sys
tem, with production quotas for each country
based on its share in OPEC production in the
fourth quarter of 1981. While this agreement did
succeed in restraining the fall in prices. a number
of members objected to the production ceilings.
Some countries attempted to increase their total
revenues by lowering their prices relative to the
Saudi Arabian benchmark, in order to increase
their share of OPEC exports.

In late 1982, noncompliance on the part of
several OPEC members with the production
ceilings contributed to continued price erosion.
Spot prices dropped in the latter half of 1982 and
early 1983, as well as contract prices on oil

products sold by US refiners. In March 1983, the
Gulf producers agreed to a reduction of $5 per
barrel in the benchmark price, bringing it to $29
per barrel.

Terms of trade. The major factors affecting
developing countries’ terms of trade were lower
oil prices, severe falls in nonoil-commodity prices,
and stability in the prices of manufactures.
Weakness in the price of oi] meant that oilexporting countries experienced a worsening in
their terms of trade in 1982, although this was
moderated by some decline in the prices of their
imports in dollar terms. The benefit to the oil
importers of weak oil prices was more than cancelled by the loss owing to the plunge in nonoilcommodity prices, and their terms of trade fell
significantly below the 1980 level. The terms-oftrade loss of oil-importing countries in 1982 was
due largely to cyclical factors, but it was superimposed on a continued erosion in their terms of
trade. which have dropped by over one-fifth since
1970, Low-income countries in sub-Saharan
Africa have been particularly affected. as they rely
heavily on nonoil-commodity exports, the prices
of which fell sharply in the 1970s relative to both
manufactures and oil. These countries’ terms of
trade have declined by about 30 percent since
1970. Preliminary data indicate that oil-importing countries’ terms of trade may have begun to
improve, as commodity prices have increased
since late 1982 and oil prices have fallen. The
terms of trade of oil-exporting countries have no
doubt fallen.

  

 

World Trade

Developing countries’ exports of merchandise
increased by less than 2 percent in 1982, well
below the growth rates experienced prior to [980.
Developing countries’ oil exports increased by
over 3 percent. as the high-income oil exporters
bore the brunt of the drop in the demand for oil.
Even so. a number of oil-exporting developing
countries also suffered declines in export volumes—Nigeria, Indonesia. and Venezuela. in
particular. The overall increase in oil exports
largely reflects the recovery of production in Iran
after the sharp fall-off in 1981. The increase in the
volumes of exports was not sufficient to compensate for the lower price of oil, and export receipts
of oil-exporting countries declined slightly. Some
countries suffered considerably worse than the
average; Mexico's exports, in current terms,
dropped by almost 12 percent and Indonesia's by
over 20 percent, for example.

Exports in volume terms of middle-income oilimporting countries increased only marginally in
1982, with roughly no change in the volume of
primary commodities exported, and an increase
of less than 2 percent in manufactured exports.
The decline in demand in industrial countries thus
reduced the export growth rates of these countries from an average of 8.1 percent in 1973-80 to
about 2 percent in 1980-82. Low growth in the
volume of exports and the fall in commodity prices
meant that exports in current dollars declined
more than 8 percent in 1980-82. Many countries,
which had achieved high rates of GDP growth
through export expansion, saw their receipts fall
substantially. For example, the export receipts of
the Philippines declined by over 13 percent in
1982.

The export volumes of low-income Asian
countries increased significantly in 1982. India’s
exports increased by about 5 percent, and China
appears to have maintained its program of
expanding exports, albeit at a reduced rate. Still,
declines in commodity prices meant that the dollar value of exports from low-income Asia were
more than 3 percent below the 1981 level. Growth
in the volume of exports from low-income African countries was close to zero, while price
declines reduced exports in current prices to more
than 14 percent below their 1980 level.

While the recession-caused reduction in
demand probably accounts for the major share
in the recent reduction in the volume of developing countries’ exports, restrictions on imports
of various kinds also played a role. Since the
conclusion of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations in 1979, the drive towards trade liberalization has slowed considerably. Industrial countries
have taken protectionist actions in a number of
sectors, particularly automobiles, steel, textiles,
and agriculture. Measures have included the
imposition of so-called “voluntary restraints” on
some countries’ exports, agreements such as the
Multifibre Arrangement, designed to limit import
penetration in industrial-country markets, and
bureaucratic delays in granting import licences.
Many of these actions (with the important
exception of the Multifibre Arrangement) affect
other industrial countries more than developing
countries. On the other hand. the incidence of
nontariff barriers and the tariffs agreed upon at
the Multilateral Trade Negotiations in 1979 are
both relatively higher than the average on products exported by developing countries. There is
a considerable concern that renewed protectionist activity could hinder developing-country
exports, just when a recovery in export receipts
is essential to meet debt-service payments and
return to reasonable growth rates.Table 4: Growth of Exports of Goods and

In the 1970s, trade among developing countries increased more rapidly than total trade. As
a result, some observers believed that growth in
this trade would partially compensate for reductions in demand from industrial countries during
the current recession. Preliminary indications do
not bear out this belief. In 1981, developing
countries’ exports to other developing countries
declined at about the same rate as their exports
to the world. In 1982, as more developing countries instituted controls on imports and restraints
on internal demand, there is some evidence that
trade among developing countries may have
contracted more than total exports. For example, Brazil’s exports, in current terms, to industrial countries declined by over 3 percent in 1982.4
By comparison, Brazil’s exports to oil-importing
developing countries dropped by about 19 percent.

Current-account balances and their financing.
Changes in 1982 in the external accounts of
developing countries reflected the already-discussed drop in export receipts, the increase in
interest rates, and a reduction in borrowing. The
combination of these factors forced developing
countries to lower their imports, and hence their
growth rates. As mentioned on the opening page
of this chapter, interest rates remained high in
both nominal and real terms in 1982, despite
declines since the mid-point of the year. These
high interest rates led many developing countries to reduce their borrowing from private
financial markets. Still, interest payments in 1982
on private-source medium-term and long-term
loans (MLT) by developing countries increased
by $7.6 billion, which was about 65 percent as
large as the total drop in their export receipts of
$11.5 billion.

World Trade 34

Supply conditions also contributed to the
decline in medium-term and long-term lending
in 1982, Commercial banks reduced their lending because of concern over developing countries’ prospects and the already high exposure of
many banks in these countries. In the third quarter
of 1982, disbursements to developing countries
from commercial banks dropped below repayments of principal. Claims on developing countries of banks reporting to the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) dropped by more
than $1 billion. The reduction in lending might
have been even greater, except that efforts of
support by the IMF, the BIS, and individual
industrial countries helped maintain confidence.

Despite the reduction in private lending, and
although there was little change in official loans, the
current-account deficit of all developing countries
remained at the same high level of 1981. Direct
foreign investment was also at roughly the same
level as in 1981, despite efforts by some developing countries to encourage increased investment as
an alternative to increasing their debt. With official development assistance showing little change.
the deficit was financed by an outflow of reserves
and short-term borrowing. For many countries,
these short-term financing measures are now
exhausted, and if further stagnation in the world
economy continues, even more severe cutbacks in
imports will be required, thus imperiling further
prospects for growth.

In contrast with 1981, when the current-account
deficit of both oil importers and oil exporters
increased, in 1982, the oil importers reduced their
deficit by $11 billion; the deficit of the oil-exporting countries, on the other hand, increased by $11
billion over 1981. However, the contractionary
impact of the external sector was greater on the
developing countries than indicated by movements in the current-account deficit. For developing countries as a whole, little change in the deficit
in 1982 was accompanied by an increase in their
interest payments, while other components of
their service income remained roughly the same.
Many developing countries, therefore, had to
reduce their trade balance by an amount greater
than the reduction in their current-account deficit.
Since export receipts fell in 1982, purchases of
imports had to be compressed even further. Table
6 shows various components of the external
accounts of developing countries.

Oil-importing countries underwent a strong
adjustment in 1982, as they reduced their currentaccount balance by over $11 billion. Interest payments on medium-term and long-term loans
increased by $6 billion, mostly as a result of high

interest rates. The resource balance was about $15
billion less than in 1981. Export receipts declined
by about $10 billion, so imports dropped by almost
$25 billion. Oil-exporting countries were not forced
into an adjustment as severe as that of the oil
importers. Their current-account and net trade
deficits increased somewhat in 1982, and the decline
in their export receipts was slight. These countries,
therefore, were able to increase their imports
somewhat, but at a slower rate than in recent years.
A number of countries were forced to institute
severely contractionary policies, including import
controls, to limit their current-account deficits. In
Nigeria, for example. the government responded
to the deterioration in oil revenues and budget
finances by increasing import restrictions, lowering the value of the naira, and placing limits on
borrowing by the individual states. Imports were
reduced by over 30 percent in the last nine months
of 1982, and GNP declined by almost 2 percent.
Brazil instituted severely contractionary policies to
control imports and limit the increase in its outstanding debt. Restrictive measures included a sharp
increase in reserve requirements to reduce expansion of domestic credit, a cut in dollar allowances
for travel abroad, a freeze in government investment (which represents a decline in real terms), and
import restrictions. In early 1983, the cruzeiro was
devalued by 30 percent. As a result of these measures, Brazil achieved a trade surplus of some $2
billion in 1982 despite the 13 percent drop in export
receipts, while GNP was flat after the decline of 3.5
percent the year before. Mexico announced a series
of policy measures to limit its current-account deficit, including a severe devaluation of the peso,
exchange controls to reduce capital flight, an
increase in the value-added tax, and a sharp cut in
the deficit of the public sector. GDP increased by

only 1 percent in 1982, and unemployment
increased substantially.

Restrictive policies and the resulting declines in
imports severely reduced growth in developing
countries. But for the intervention of the IMF, the
reduction in imports could have been even greater.
This reduction of imports by developing countries
also helped to lower exports of industrial countries. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) estimated that the decline in volume of
exports by industrial countries was largely the result
of reduced demand by developing countries, and
the OECD estimated that the reduction in nonOECD imports may have reduced growth in GNP
of its members by about half a percentage point.
‘The world dealt with the worst recession since the
Second World War by collectively reducing
demand.

Official Development Assistance

Net disbursements of official development
assistance (ODA) from member countries of the
Development Assistance Committee (DAC)* to
the developing countries in 1982 increased to an
estimated $28.0 billion, up $2.4 billion from the
level in 1981. The effect on individual countries
varied, depending on the source of assistance and
the currency composition of their imports. Net
disbursements of ODA from DAC countries
represented 0.39 percent of these countries’ GNP,
a slight increase from 0.38 percent of GNP provided in 1980. Only five countries (Denmark,

Data for 1982 on ODA from countries that are
members of the Organization of Petroleum

countries, a slight decrease from the year before,
or 1.46 percent of their GNP. The major share
came from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United
Arab Emirates. In those countries, ODA
amounted to 4.77 percent, 1.98 percent, and 2.88
percent, respectively, of GNP in 1981.

External Debt

The 1980-82 recession, characterized by
extremely high real interest rates, stagnation in
world trade. and a sharp fall in commodity prices,
seriously complicated developing countries’
management of their external debt. The fall in
export receipts, coupled with the increase in
interest payments, made it very difficult for a
number of countries to maintain their debt-service payments. The ratio of debt service to export
receipts (including services) for all developing
countries increased from 13.6 percent in 1980 to

20.7 percent in 1982. Outstanding medium-term
and long-term debt increased from 76.1 percent
of exports in 1980 to 103.8 percent in 1982. These
aggregate measures can be misleading, as one
country’s excess debt-service capacity is not
available to cushion the liabilities of another
country, and the impact of a given level of each
ratio varies according to the flexibility of each
country’s economy. However, there is no question that the external position of many countries
worsened considerably in the past year.

Some developing countries borrowed heavily
from commercial banks during the 1970s. For the
most part, borrowing by these countries was not
excessive, compared with the growth in their
exports and income during that period, and taking expectations of continued high growth into
account. Real interest rates were low or negative, which encouraged increased borrowing. The
use of external capital for productive investment
enabled a number of major borrowers to achieve
rates of growth far in excess either of the industrial countries or the average for all developing
countries. However, the interruption in export
growth and decline in commodity prices, coupled with the increase in interest rates, have created serious liquidity problems for a number of
major borrowers. These problems were accentuated by the fear on the part of some banks that34 The Economic Scene: A Global Perspective

others might withdraw from international lending to developing countries. The level of net flows,
particularly in the third quarter of 1982, was
severely reduced. This reduction seriously complicated the already difficult cash-flow situation
faced by many developing countries. In addition. the strong appreciation of the dollar contributed to an increase in the burden of debtservice payments, as about 70 percent of developing countries’ debt is denominated in dollars.
Four of the largest borrowers (Argentina. Brazil. Chile. and Mexico) recently have made
arrangements with their creditors to defer
repayment of principal on their debt.

Many smailer borrowers, on the other hand,
mostly poorer countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
rescheduled their external debt to official creditors through the “Paris Club’ in 1981 and 1982.
The debt of these countries is largely from official sources and at relatively easy terms. However, these poorer countries tend to rely on
exports of primary commodities and lack the
flexibility to switch the composition of their
exports. The sharp fall in export prices has made
it very difficult for the poorer countries to meet
debt-service payments. Overall, almost as many
developing countries have had to reschedule loans
in the last two vears as in the previous twenty-five
years.

The rescheduling process has been accompanied by an increase in service charges. A
country that has rescheduled must continue to pay
interest on the full amount of outstanding debt.
which includes the rescheduled portion, Interest
payments. therefore. are increased over what they
would have been had the country been able to
meet its repayments of principal. In some cases.
the interest rate charged on the rescheduled debt
is higher than on earlier loans, as a result of the
increased risk on the new loans. Reschedulings
have been essential to avoid formal defaults and
the consequences for countries’ future access to
foreign capital. The rescheduling. however. simply shifts the burden of repayments to the future
and increases the total stream of interest payments.

Despite the difficulties a number of countries
are now experiencing, the record shows that,
given favorable conditions in the international
environment, developing countries can achieve
high rates of growth. Their success during the
1960s and 1970s may be a more reliable indicator
of their long-term prospects than their current
difficulties. Developing countries achieved an
average rate of growth of 4.8 percent from 1973—

80. well above the 2.5 percent rate of growth in
industrial countries. Increased investment made
a significant contribution to growth. The share of
investment in GDP jumped from 22.2 percent in
1970 to 27.2 percent in 1980. and most of this

 

 

 

investment was financed out of domestic savings. Middle-income countries. which hold the
hon’s share of developing countries’ commercial
debt. increased their rate of investment growth
to 8 percent a year in the 1970s. compared with
an increase of only 1.5 percent a year among
industrial countries. Developing countries’ nonoil-merchandise exports increased. in volume
terms, at 9.2 percent a year from 1973 to 1980,
while exports of manufactures grew at an average annual rate of 12.4 percent. A number of
major borrowers that are now experiencing difficulties have proven their ability to achieve high
rates of export and income growth.

It is possible that debt levels of these countries
would not have been considered excessive in the
conditions existing during the latter half of the 1970s.
when real interest rates were low and export volumes and prices were increasing. Today. however.
the debt of a number of countries ts less easily
manageable in light of unprecedented real interest
rates, falling commodity prices. and reduced
demand for developing countries* exports.
Assuming an intelligent response to current problems, it is likely that the crisis can be weathered
without serious disruption to the international
financial system. Unfortunately. the measures taken
by many developing countries to restrain their
borrowing have been, and will continue to be.
extremely painful. Austerity programs and attempts to achieve trade surpluses are exacting a
heavy toll. Just as seriously. in some countries,
reductions in public expenditures have particularly affected investment projects. which could have
adverse consequences for future living standards.
Private investment has also declined sharply. in
response to reduced demand. uncertain prospects,
and high interest rates. Because reduced investment lowers the potential growth of the economy.
it may take many years for countries. particularly
those in Latin America. to recover from their current problems. The difficulties in the short term can
be ameliorated. to a degree. through increased
efficiency in the use of human and material
resources. In the particular case of Latin American countries, as reported on page 100. “Over the
long term, [they] are well positioned to resume
strong growth.”

Given the serious situation of many developingcountry borrowers, commercial banks have been
understandably reluctant to increase their exposure. Indeed, a major danger to the financial svstem in 1982 was the threat that the banks would curb

creditors or anteed by thom. Since then. it has handled
the majority of renegotiations of official and officially guaranteed debt. More than a dozen debtor countries have been
involved through the years.new loans to developing countries just when continued lending was most necessary. However,
concerted action by international institutions (particularly by the IMF and the BIS) and a number of
industrial-country governments has facilitated an
increase in exposure by the major banks. In the
process, a new approach to reschedulings has
evolved, involving the construction of “package
funding” by the IMF, the BIS. and various governments. Further lending by the major banks has
been made one of the conditions for the implementation of the package; in earlier reschedulings,
banks often cut a borrower off from new mediumterm loans. As a result of these agreements, the
exposure of commercial banks in Mexico and Brazil actually increased at a rate higher than inflation
last year, although at a reduced rate compared with
that which prevailed during the 1970s.

Despite the favorable long-term prospects of
developing countries and the high degree of international cooperation that has been achieved notwithstanding, changes in the global economic
environment are essential before current debt
problems can be overcome. First and foremost, a
higher rate of recovery of the industrial countries
would help increase exports of developing countries. A high rate of growth in industrial countries
would translate into a growth in the exports of
developing countries only if protectionist pressures are not allowed to cause new barriers against
trade to be erected. While more difficult to achieve,
a reduction in current levels of protection would
also. of course, facilitate expansion of developingcountry exports. At the same time, a decline in the
level of interest rates and an increase in the level of
ODA will help the developing countries to recover
from the depths of the current recession. All this
was recognized by the leaders of the seven industrial countries who met in Williamsburg, Virginia,
in May 1983.

Most recent data support the view that industrial-country growth is beginning to pick up; as a
result, pressures for protectionism may ease. In
addition, interest rates have declined significantly
from the point they reached in mid-1982.

After a recession much deeper and more prolonged than expected. international economic
conditions may. indeed. be improving. which is
essential before developing countries can hope to
recover from the current situation. However. the
crisis is by no means resolved. Even the most optimistic scenario for short-term economic developments holds forth the promise that the next few
years will be both difficult and painful.

issues in a variety of fora. In meetings held
between developed and developing countries and
among the developing countries during the past
fiscal year, attention was particularly focused on
problems relating to financial flows, external debt.
international trade, and commodities.

Global negotiations. There is still no agreement on a Resolution to launch global negotiations in the United Nations. Consultations were
pursued at the Thirty-Seventh Session of the
United Nations General Assembly without success. Proposals were made at the Western Economic Summit at Versailles in June 1982 for
negotiations with the Group of 77. but. so far,
there has been no Resolution.

GATT ministerial meeting. In November 1982,
eighty-eight countries were represented at the
ministerial level at a meeting of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in
Geneva. A joint declaration issued at the end of
the meeting reaffirmed a basic commitment
against protectionism and a renewed consensus
in support of the GATT system. One of the
undertakings agreed by the parties in drawing up
their priorities for the 1980s was to ensure that
trade policies and measures are consistent with
GATT principles. The declaration dealt with
specific areas, notably agriculture. where negotiations concerned the integration of agricultural
trade in the GATT Multilateral Trading System.
A further area of concern was the safeguard system to ensure efficiency and predictability in the
application of the safeguard clause under the
GATT to both importing and exporting countries.

Development Committee meetings. The
Development Committee" met in Toronto, Canada, in September 1982 under the chairmanship
of Manuel Ulloa Elias, Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Commerce of Peru. The
Committee reviewed the world-development
situation and prospects for the developing countries, noting in particular the desperate need for
further assistance for the poorest countries served
by IDA. The Committee particularly noted the
importance IDA donors attach to providing IDA
with additional commitment authority in fis

1984. In regard to the lending program of the
IBRD, the Executive Board of the IBRD and
those of other multilateral development banks
were invited to continue the study of the scope
for expansion in real terms for further lending to
developing countries. The Committee endorsed
the efforts of the World Bank and regional banks
to secure additional financial flows for developing countries through cofinancing on terms
appropriate to borrowing countries. On lending
for energy development, the limited resources
available for lending for energy by the Bank were
noted, and the Directors were requested to
explore new approaches on financing mechanisms that could attract broad support from
members with capital contributions.

At the Development Committee's April 1983
meeting in Washington, D.C., under the chairmanship of Ghulam Ishaq Khan. Minister of
Finance, Commerce, and Economic Coordination of Pakistan, concern was expressed that the
economic situation had remained difficult since
the last meeting in September 1982. The Committee addressed the broad subject of the elements of global economic-recovery efforts, under
the following items: financial flows from. and level
of lending by, multilateral institutions and the
implications for their capital base: the status and
funding of IDA: the external-debt problems of
developing countries; and the linkages between
trade and the promotion of development. As for
lending programs of multilateral institutions, the
World Bank was invited to put forward proposals, with due regard to financial prudence. that
would allow an expansion of the Bank’s lending
program. The management of the Bank was also
requested to present a specific proposal to the
Executive Directors for a Selective Capital
Increase in line with the Eighth General Review
of Quotas in the Fund by the time of the next
Committee meeting in September 1983. The
crucial importance of IDA in financing the
development programs of low-income countries
was reaffirmed. Note was taken of the critical
situation facing the sixth replenishment of IDA,
stretched out over four years with the resulting
reduction in intended annual IDA commitments. With regard to the seventh replenishment of IDA, special needs for an expanded
replenishment were noted. On external-debt
problems, the need to maintain and increase
financial flows to developing countries from official sources was emphasized. The linkages
between trade and development were discussed
by the Committee. In particular, the Committee
called on governments to resist protectionist
pressures. Both the Bank and the Fund were
urged to collaborate with the GATT in keeping
under review progress made in liberalizing the
international-trade environment.

Nonaligned-movement summit. The Seventh
Conference of Heads of State or Government of
Nonaligned Countries was held in New Delhi.
India, in March 1983 under the chairmanship of
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India. More than
100 countries were represented. The Economic
Declaration of the Conference reaffirmed the
commitment of heads of state to the early
launching of global negotiations. They called for
a program of immediate measures in areas of
crucial importance to developing countries—in
food, energy development, financial flows, World
Bank assistance, IMF balance-of-payments support, trade, and raw materials. In the field of
monetary and financial issues and the transfer of
resources, the Declaration held that the official
development-assistance (ODA) target, set by the
United Nations, of 0.7 percent of GNP. should
be attained by 1985 and, within this context. that
a target be met of 0.15 percent ot GNP for ODA
to the least-developed countries. A substantial
expansion, both of the current lending program
of the Bank. as well as in the seventh replenishment of IDA, was called for. On external debt,
the heads of state urged the development of a
multilateral framework for the restructuring of
the debt burden of the developing countries. They
also called for reform of the international monetary system and the convening of an international conference on money and finance for
development.

Group of 77: Buenos Aires meeting. The fifth
ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 convened
in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in March 1983. The
purpose of the meeting was to prepare positions
on issues for presentation to the Trade and
Development Board and for the June 1983
meeting of UNCTAD VI in Belgrade. Yugoslavia. The Declaration that ensued from the
meeting called for a reactivation of the world
economy and accelerated growth in the developing countries through global solutions. Ministers reiterated their commitment to the
immediate launching of global negotiations, thus
supporting the decision of the nonaligned summit at New Delhi. In the interrelated fields of
commodities, trade, money, and finance and
development, a Program of Immediate Measures was called for, including the establishment
of the Common Fund. accelerated World Bank
lending, a substantial increase in concessional
assistance, the restructuring of the external debt
of the developing countries, an immediate and
substantial allocation of special drawing rights
(SDRs), and an increase in IMF quotas.

Commonwealth meetings. The Commonwealth finance ministers met in London. UK.
under the chairmanship of Sir Geoffrey Howe,
Chancellor of the Exchequer of the United
Kingdom. The communique of the meetingreported that there were wide-ranging discussions on the state of the world economy and on
the growing strains in the international financial
system. Special action was called for to expand
the lending operations of the World Bank to meet
the increased needs of its member countries.
Regarding the poorest countries, Commonwealth finance ministers gave strong support to
a substantial increase in real terms in the replenishment of IDA. There was particular support for
donor countries to provide bridging contributions for 1984 in order to avoid a decline in IDA
lending activities in that year. Commonwealth
finance ministers also expressed the view that to
avoid a further deterioration in the world economy and to initiate a process of sustained recovery, the whole framework of international
cooperation would need reform. The Commonwealth Secretariat was accordingly mandated to
carry out a study of the international trade and
payments system and. in particular, of the role of
the international institutions. A Steering Group
of experts is preparing a report for the September 1983 meeting of the Commonwealth finance
ministers.

On the eve of the GATT Ministerial Meeting.
the Commonwealth trade ministers met in
Geneva. Switzerland. The meeting gave substantial support for the concept of a standstill on
protectionist barriers. The Commonwealth
Meeting on Trade followed a protracted Commonwealth study with a report by an expert group
on protectionism, which was presented by the
Commonwealth Secretariat in preparation for the
GATT Ministerial Meeting.

The International Dialogue 37

UNCTAD VI. The Sixth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development took place
in Belgrade. Yugoslavia. in June 1983. The focus
was on the deteriorating world economic situation and its impact on development. with the
integrating factors of international trade and
commodities and financial and monetary issues.

The Williamsburg summit. In late May 1983,
leaders of seven industrial countries—Canada,
France, the Federal Republic of Germany. Italy.
Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United
States. as weil as the President of the Commission of the European Communities—met in Williamsburg, Virginia (USA), to review the world
economic situation.

The two-day summit ended in agreement ona
series of broad policies designed to nourish the
worldwide economic recovery over the next several years. Agreement was reached that antiinflation policies be continued and that there
should be a rollback of recently imposed trade
barriers.

In their Declaration issued at the close of the
meeting, the leaders acknowledged that the
“weight of the recession had fallen very heavily
on developing countries” and that “special
attention” will be given to “the flow of resources,
especially official development assistance. to
poorer countries.” They also reaffirmed their
“commitments to provide agreed funding levels
for the International Development Association.”38

Chapter Three:

Cofinancing

New cofinancing instruments that will permit
the World Bank, for the first time, to participate
directly in commercial loans were introduced
during the past year. The instruments, designed
to increase the participation of commercial banks
in World Bank-assisted projects in developing
countries, were approved by the Bank’s Executive Directors in January 1983. They are intended
to supplement the Bank's present methods of
cofinancing with the private sector and provide a
wider range of options for structuring cofinanced operations.

The Bank's need to play a larger role in mebilizing a greater flow of funds from other sources
has expanded as demand has increased for external financing for development projects at a time
when the Bank has faced capital constraints.
Cofinancing, one of the most significant ways by
which these flows can be increased. directly
associates World Bank funds with those provided by other sources in financing specific projects or programs in developing countries.

The three main categories of cofinancing partners with the Bank are: (a) official sources, which
include governments, their agencies. and other
multilateral financial institutions: (b) exportcredit institutions, which are directly associated

 

with financing the procurement of certain goods

and services from a particular country: and (c)
private financial institutions. primarily commercial banks.

For those World Bank borrowers that can borrow at least some of their needs for capital on
commercial terms. the most important source of
additional external financing is commercial banks.
In today’s international capital markets. however, commercial banks are becoming reluctant
to increase, or even maintain. past levels of lending to numerous developing countries. This
reluctance comes at a time when developing
countries continue to need substantial amounts
of external capital on the best possible terms.

Extensive discussions with the Bank’s borrowers and with commercial lenders during the
past vear indicated that the Bank’s methods of
attracting cofinancing funds were inadequate in

 

two important respects: In the current financial
climate, they were unable to increase substantially private capital flows and they did not provide borrowers with more benefits than they could
receive from regular commercial transactions.
The traditional arrangement for cofinancing with
commercial banks has been as follows: The Bank
and commercial banks enter into separate loan
agreements with a borrowing country; loans from
the commercial banks are on market terms and
are negotiated directly by the banks with the
borrower. The loans are linked to the Bank loan
through an optional cross-default clause, and a
memorandum of agreement is signed by the Bank
and the agent for the commercial banks.

As of January 1983, however. three additional
options became available that permit the Bank
to participate in financing from commercial
sources in addition to making a direct loan. These
options will be tested for the next year or two to
see whether these additional approaches prove
attractive to colenders and advantageous to borrowers.

All three options are intended to provide
maturities to developing-country borrowers that
are longer than those available from a directmarket operation. The new options are:

@ Direct financial participation by the World
Bank in the later maturities of a commercial loan.
The Bank, in addition to providing a direct loan,
may hold an initial share—ranging from 10 percent to 25 percent—in a syndicated loan from
commercial banks for the same purpose. The
Bank’s presence in the commercial syndicated
loan should result in loan maturities that are significantly longer than available in the market.
Annual repayments of principal by the borrower
would be made first to commercial lenders until
their share of the loan is fully repaid: in later years.
principal payments would be applied to the World
Bank share. Example: A commercial-bank loan.
under normal market circumstances, carries a
maturity of eight years. Under this particular
instrument. the objective is to persuade commercial banks to extend that term to nine or ten
years in return for World Bank participation in
the loan: the Bank would not be repaid until the
eleventh and twelfth years. As the loan is amor-tized, the World Bank’s share would be made
available for sale to the commercial lenders.

e Guarantees of the later maturities of a private loan instead of direct funding. Under this
option, the Bank would guarantee repayment of
the later part of a syndicated commercial-bank
loan without participating in it directly. This
approach, too, is designed to extend maturities.
As the loan is amortized. and the guaranteed
portion comes within the normal range of market maturities, the guaranteed share can be
reduced.

© Contingent participation in the later maturities of a commercial loan that, initially. would be
financed entirely by commercial lenders. Under
this option, the borrower’s annual debt service on
the commercial loan would be fixed even though
the interest rate carried by the loan would be
variable. If the interest rate rises to a level above
the initiai rate, the amortization will not be completed on the original schedule. The World Bank’s
contingent commitment would be to finance the
balance of the principal (if any) at the end of the
term of the initial loan if rates turn out to be higher
than anticipated. The commercial lenders would
have the opportunity to purchase the outstanding balance for their own account. The benefit of
approach, in addition to extending maturities. is that it provides borrowers with a fixedpayment schedule for their debt service, enabling better planning.

During the pilot phase of the new cofinancing
program, the World Bank is authorized to provide up to $500 million for participation in commercial loans. About fifteen to twenty lending
operations are expected to be cofinanced through
the three new instruments. Assuming that the
Bank's share of each commercial transaction
would be 20 percent, the pilot program could

 

  

Bank Policies 39

result in cofinanced funds totaling $2.5 billion.
These funds would be used to finance sound
investment projects already judged suitable for
direct Bank lending.

It is anticipated that, by providing commercial
banks ways by which they can become more
closely associated with the World Bank, their
perception of the quality and security of cofinanced assets may be increased. It is also hoped
that the new instruments will strengthen investor
confidence. result in an increase in net capital
flows to developing countries, and extend loan
maturities.

Special Assistance Program

A Special Assistance Program, designed to help
developing countries restore their development
efforts despite adverse external circumstances,
was approved by the Executive Directors in February 1983. The program involves financial
measures and policy advice to help those countries that are themselves pursuing appropriate
policies.

The program was not intended as a solution to
the problems of countries in difficulty. The Bank
cannot, and should not. attempt to finance the
balance-of-payments deficits of its members; it
does have. however, a responsibility to
member countries with policy advice and spe
financial assistance so as to maintain the maximum possible level of development activities and
minimize the erosion of future growth prospects.

The objectives of the program are to:

e@ emphasize high-priority operations that
support policy change:

e expand lending to help maintain crucial
infrastructure and fuller use of existing capacity.
particularly in export-oriented activities:

® expand Bank advisory services in the design

including the reordering of investment priorities:

@ maintain the impetus of project activities by
increasing the share of Bank financing in projects;

@ accelerate disbursements out of existing
loans and credits. where feasibie: and

© urge other ienders to make similar efforts.

The program was established for two years in
the expectation that the world economy will have
begun to recover during this period. A review of
the first year of the program will take place early
n 1984. If recovery takes longer, however. an
extension of the program would be considered.

The estimated increase in IBRD disbursements as a result of the Special Assistance Program is S82 billion over the period fiscal 1983-85.
an 8 percent increase in total projected disbursements for those years. Net transfers (disbursements less interest and amortization) are expected
to increase by nearly 25 percent in this period as
a result of the program.

The Special Assistance Program relates primarily to IBRD loans and cannot easily be applied to
IDA credits, because IDA already finances a high
percentage of project costs. Moreover. even the
relatively modest volume of accelerated disbursements that will be realized through the program
would be difficult for IDA to finance; IDA
disbursements are financed through calls on donors
who already face severe problems in meeting existing
calls as a result of current budget constraints.

The major impact of the Special Assistance Program on the Bank’s financial position will be on the
borrowing program of the IBRD. It is expected that
IBRD borrowings will have to increase by about
$1.6 billion to accomodate the needs of the program—a slight increase over the $30.2 billion previously anticipated for the period fiscal 1983-85.

The Special Assistance Program has five major
elements. They are:

1. Expanded structural-adjustment lending. The
Bank is prepared to set aside temporarily its previous policy of restricting structural-adjustment
lending to 30 percent of a country’s total lending
program. Should it appear that total structuraladjustment lending, together with other nonproject loans. may exceed 10 percent of the Bank's
overall lending program—the level currently agreed
upon as a ceiling—the matter will be brought to the
Executive Directors for their consideration.

2. Sector-adjustment support. There are situations in which policy reforms focused on specific
sectors are more appropriate than countrywide
structural-adjustment programs. Such loans may
involve export development. rehabilitation and
modernization of existing facilities. and provision
of agricultural inputs as part of a program to modify the incentive structure.

 

 

3. Financing an increased share of project costs.
The Bank generally finances the foreign-exchange
costs of projects. In the middle-income and higherincome countries, exceptions to this rule may be
made when the foreign-exchange component is very
small: in these cases, the Bank may finance 35 percent of total costs, In the lower-income countries.
the Bank frequently finances a portion of the local
costs. In the poorest countries. the Bank finances
up to 95 percent of project costs.

To help ensure completion of high-priority projects and programs as expeditiously as possible, it
was agreed to permit the Bank to modify its costsharing criteria on a country-specific and projectspecific basis, on existing projects. by: a) reducing
the scope of projects, while retaining the entire
amount of Bank financing: b) extending supplementary loans, including retroactive financing, and
c) amending loans to reduce the time period covered by projects.

As to new commitments, the Bank will consider
financing a larger share of recurrent costs early in
the life of a project and financing working-capital
requirements of development finance companies
or other intermediaries. The Bank also plans to
make increasing use of revolving funds.

4. Enhanced policy dialogue. On request. the
Bank will help governments review investment
programs, macroeconomic poli . trade and
pricing policies, expand its ance for debt
management. and assist in evaluating changes in
development priorities.

5. Coordination with other donors. The Bank will
intensify its use of various consultative mechanisms to urge other international lending institutions and bilateral aid donors to consider similar
measures. !

 

 

 

 

Energy

The world entered an era of higher energy costs
almost a decade ago. The transition was an abrupt
one. and most developing countries have still not
adjusted their energy consumption and production patterns fully to reflect the high cost of
energy. The urgency of adjusting to higher energy
costs is in no way diminished by the recent substantial reduction of international oil prices. as this
reduction is likely to be temporary, and because

‘During fiscal 1983, the Bank participated in seventeen aidcoordinating or consultative mectings. Fourteen were chaired
by the Bank. They were for Bangladesh ue a. the CG aribbean Group for Cooperation in Econon

s}. India, the Republic of Korea, Mad

Pakistan. Sri Lanka (two mectings). and Sudan, as well

as a mecting of the Consultative Group on International

Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and a donor seminar on the

developing countries are still in the middle of the
transition to energy strategies that are appropriate to the current level of oil prices.

In presenting the report. “The Energy Transition in Developing Countries.” Bank staff outlined to the Executive Directors three measures
that were necessary to facilitate the adjustment
process:

e A rational pricing of energy and better
demand management to improve efficiency in the
use of energy:

e A reorientation of industrial. agricultural,
and transport development to take account of
higher energy costs; and

e Anexpansion of investment to develop those
indigenous sources of energy that are cheaper than
imported oil.

According to the report. the investment needed
to develop the developing countries’ potential
energy resources is estimated at $130 billion a year
(in 1982 doilars) for the next ten years. of which
$64 billion is in foreign exchange (see Table 1).
The Bank estimates that even if international oil
prices fall to $25 a barrel (in 1982 dollars), most
of these investments—half of which would be in

the power sector—will remain attractive. Developing countries have the potential to increase the
production of commercial energy from 1.7 biilion tons of oil equivalent (toe) in 1980 to 3.1 billion toe in 1995. Should this level be reached, the
developing countries would be able to reduce
substantially their energy imports. The report also
stressed the critical importance of energy conservation in developing countries.

Outlining the role of the World Bank in the
energy sector, many Directors emphasized that
the Bank must serve as a catalyst in encouraging
the flow of capital and technology to developing
countries. During their discussion of the report,
there emerged a general consensus among the
Directors that because of the importance of
energy in development, there was a need for the
Bank to provide resources and assistance to
member countries in solving the complex issues
within the sector. It was also recognized that
countries must strengthen their own efforts to
define energy strategies and to mobilize resources
to increase substantially their rate of investment
in the sector. It was agreed that the Bank would
continue its diverse program of energy activities

within (a) the constraints of overall resource
availability and (b) the guidelines on sectoral
allocation that had been previously agreed to—
that not more than 25 percent of total Bank lending is to be for energy projects. Resources would
also be allocated to projects in which the Bank
has a substantial nonfinancial contribution,
through, for example, sector-policy analysis,
facilitating the transfer of technology. assistance
in project design, institution building. and mobilization of resources.

Since fiscal 1978. when the Executive Directors first agreed to expand assistance for energy
development, lending by the Bank has increased
rapidly; by the end of fiscal 1983. that lending
amounted to $14,036 million, constituting 20.1
percent of total commitments. As Table 2 shows.
lending for electric power forms the largest part
of the Bank’s energy program; this trend is
expected to continue over the next fifteen years.
even though Bank loans now amount to less than
5 percent of the investment programs they support, compared with 30 percent in the 1960s.
However, it is the lending commitments in the oil
ector that have shown the most rapid
se. Since fiscal 1978, $2.723 million has been
committed for oil and gas projects in more than
fifty countries. Exploration-promotion projects.
designed to assist in the collection of data and the
promotion of petroleum exploration by international oil companies. have accounted for the
largest number of projects: by dollar volume,
hydrocarbon-development loans have been most
important.

In addition to lending for traditional projects
in petroleum, power, coal. and forestry. the
Bank’s program has also supported less-conventional projects as a means of developing alternative sources of energy. In Brazil, a $250 million
loan is helping in the development of a national
fuel-alcohol program. Kenya. the Philippines. and
Yugoslavia have obtained assistance for exploring and developing geothermal energy. In

 

 

  

 

Morocco, a $20 million loan is being used to test
alternative means of exploiting the country’s
enormous resources of oil shale. Other “unusual” projects that have been supported by the
Bank through technical or financial assistance
include peat resources. biogas plants, and promoting the development of solar. wind. and biomass energy.

As Bank loans for energy have increased. so
has cofinancing of Bank-supported projects by aid
agencies. export-credit agencies. commercial
banks, and others. During the period fiscal 1979~
82, $11,200 million of cofinancing were associated with $9,900 million of Bank funds. The
highest degree of cofinancing is in oil and gas
projects, whose financing plans anticipate that
every $1 portion of a Bank loan will be matched
by $1.78 from external cofinancers.

The Executive Directors recognized the limitations imposed on the Bank’s lending by its capital base. and encouraged the Bank to help
increase the flow of investible funds for energy
from all sources, including equity flows. All
available approaches should be explored:
approaches mentioned by the Directors included
the establishment of an energy affiliate, setting
up a trust fund, borrowings from member governments for specific projects, advance commitments for projects from export-credit agencies.
involvement of the International Finance Corporation, and examination of the possibilities of
multilateral investment insurance.

The Directors generally agreed that maintaining an active involvement by the Bank in cnergy
is justified by the priority the sector has in the
overall adjustment process for many developing
countries. by the difficult adjustment that is
urgently needed within the energy sector (for
example. shifting from the use of one primary
energy source to another and industrial retrofitting). and by the large volume of funds that is
necessary for energy investments in the coming
years.44 Bank Policies, Activities, and Finances

Bank Activities

Economic Development Institute

For more than twenty-seven years, the Economic Development Institute (EDI) has been
concerned with the training of senior officials of
developing countries that are members of the Bank,
helping them to improve the management of their
economies and to increase the efficiency of their
investment programs. The target group for training includes officials of ministries of finance and
planning, agencies dealing with various sectors of
development, and central banks and development-finance institutions. A particular feature of
EDI’s intensive seminars is that they draw on the
working experience, policy analysis, studies of
comparative development, and other empirical
research of the World Bank, as well as on outside
knowledge and experience.

In fiscal 1983, the final year of its current fiveyear program, EDI conducted seventeen seminars
in Washington and fifty-two activities overseas,
which were attended by a total of about 1,500 participants. The seminars are listed in a separate table.
ED] also provided assistance to a number of training institutions in connection with twenty-one of
their own training activities.

The emphasis in EDI’s program began to shift
during fiscal 1983 toward increasing the number of
training activities offered for trainers in other institutions, improving and expanding the training
materials which are produced by EDI staff for their
own use and for use by other institutions, and
holding more policy-oriented seminars for high-level
officials. Examples of the last mentioned include a
series of four seminars on agricultural policies, which
was held for African senior officials; a seminar on
rural health care held in Washington in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO);
and a seminar on the management of metropolitan
growth held in Rio de Janeiro, which was cospansored by the United Nations Centre for Human
Settlements.

Six seminars on a variety of topics were held in
China, including two held under an expanded program of training for China financed by the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), for
which the World Bank is the executing agency.

Attention continued to be given to the needs of
Arab countries, directly, through seminars, and
indirectly, through assistance to the Arab Organi
zation for Agricultural Development to help it
organize a series of regional seminars on agricultural project planning and implementation for
Arab countries.

In fiscal 1983, three books were published that
had grown out of EDI training activities: Aspects
of Development Bank Management, by William
Diamond and V.S. Raghavan: Economic Analysis
of Agricultural Projects (revised edition), by J. Price
Gittinger; and Pricing Policy for Development Bank
Management, by Gerald M. Meier. Five other booklength manuscripts are currently being prepared.
EDI continued to expand the dissemination of its
training materials worldwide to training institutions, universities, libraries, international organizations, development banks, and other groups.
These training materials are currently being recataloged with a new referencing system.

Cooperation continued between EDI and UN
agencies. In Washington, the sixth annual seminar
on world-development issues, cosponsored with the
UN Institute for Training and Research, was held
for senior members of country delegations at the
UN in New York. (A seminar of this type was also
held by EDI for senior members of Washington
embassies.) Also in Washington, the fourth and fifth
seminars on preinvestment methodology, fully
financed by the UNDP, were held for UNDP Resident Representatives and their deputies. EDI also
cooperated with UN Habitat. WHO, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, and the UNDP in offering
seminars in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

Among EDI’s innovative activities in fiscal 1983
were seminars on costs, efficiency. and strategies
in the education sector; industrial development for
small economies; forestry projects; management
of the project cycle; and telecommunications. In
Latin America and the Caribbean. seminars were
cosponsored for the first time with the Caribbean
Agricultural Credit Association and the Interamerican Institute for Cooperation in Agriculture.

Fiscal 1983 was an especially noteworthy year in
EDI’s development because of the agreement by
the Executive Directors of new directions for EDI.
This action followed preparation of a report on “The
Future of the EDI” by a task force headed by the
Bank’s Vice President for Operations Policy.have a “multiplier” effect.

It was the consensus of the Directors that three
priorities will, in broad terms, determine the future
objectives and programs of EDI: (a) a program of
institutional development for selected training
establishments in developing countries. This program will include technical assistance, training of
trainers, and preparation of appropriate training
materials; (b) direct training efforts, with emphasis on training of officials from sub-Saharan Africa
and from other countries lacking appropriate
training facilities; and (c) a program of seminars
dealing with national and sectoral policy issues.
bringing together officials of developing countries,
senior Bank staff, and academics.

According to the report on “The Future of the
EDI,” emphasis on institutional development is
appropriate because of the evolution that has
occurred since EDI’s creation in 1955. First, there
is today recognition that strong institutions and
administrators able to formulate and implement
sound government policies have as much impact on
development—if not more—as the availability of
financial resources. Second, in many regions,
training institutions (national, regional, and international) have been created. Although these institutions are playing a major role in meeting the
training needs of the developing countries, their
expansion and strengthening are required because
of the magnitude of the needs.

The underlying principle behind the new
emphasis on institutional development is that, by

Bank Activities 45

 

Officials from developing countries attending a course at the EDI, Emphasis placed on institutional development can

helping to strengthen training institutions, EDI’s
efforts can have a “‘multiplier” effect that enables
more officials in developing countries to benefit
from Bank experience than would be possible were
EDI's staff limited to organizing seminars and lecturing. Institutional assistance by EDI will include
training of trainers, the provision of EDI training
materials, help in designing and delivering courses,
and advice on improving organization and management.

While the annual number of EDI’s overall training activities is projected to increase during the
period fiscal 1985 to fiscal 1989, the new emphasis
on the training of trainers will require a gradual
decrease in the annual number of direct training
activities conducted by EDI for development
practitioners. By fiscal 1989, it is expected that
approximately half of EDI’s training will be for
trainers and half for development practitioners. This
compares with 10 percent and 90 percent, respectively, in fiscal 1983.

However, EDI direct training for development
practitioners will continue to increase in subSaharan Africa. The reduction in direct training will
principally affect Asia and Latin America, where
the largest growth of training institutions has
occurred. As noted, however, EDI intends, where
possible, to increase its assistance to such institutions. EDI direct training will also continue to be
made available to the institutionally least-developed countries in other regions, as well as to small46 Bank Policies, Activities, and Finances

to hold more high-level policy seminars of the type
that was held in the past year.

ED1is also reviewing and evaluating its existing
stock of training materials. and additional resources
will be devoted to increasing its output of case
studies. exercises. and other training materials
suitable for use by EDI and other training institutions.

Fiscal 1984 will be a year in which a start will be
made in adopting the new program priorities.
However, because of the lead time required to bring
about such fundamental changes in the program,
the new directions will only be fully implemented
from fiscal 1985 onward.

Technical Assistance

The deterioration of the economic climate in
many of the Bank’s developing member countries and the obstacles this deterioration has
placed in the way of the development process have
brought increased attention to the technicalassistance role played by the Bank. In fiscal 1983.
technical assistance continued to rise in volume.
as well as to diversify. both in scope and in the
mechanisms used to provide it.

Asin the past. the largest element of technical
assistance was that financed under the lending
program. and particularly as a component of loans
for other purposes. More than 90 percent of loans
and credits now have some provision for technical assistance. and. in fiscal 1983, these technical-assistance components totaled $1,275.3
million in 219 operations: the figure was $1,151
million in 212 operations the year before. In
addition, seven free-standing, technical-assistance loans and credits were approved for a total
of $52.7 million. The comparable figures in 1982
were eleven loans and credits. with a total value
of $72.5 million.

Among the larger amounts of technical assistance financed as components of Bank loans were
$74 million in the third transmigration project in
Indonesia: $3() million in a power loan to Zimbabwe.: $24.9 million in a water and sewerage
sector loan to Brazil; $22.7 million in an agricultural-education and research project in China;
$14.6 million in a refinery-rehabilitation project
in Bangladesh: and $12.1 million in an iron-ore
project in Brazil.

Project-related training. which is included
within the total of technical-assistance components. amounted to $230.4 million in 176 operations, up from comparable 1982 figures of $185.1
million in 160 projects.

The free-standing technical-assistance loans and
credits approved during the year went to Congo
(S11 million): Kenya ($6 million); Mali ($10.4
million): Mauritania ($4.6 million}: Nepal ($6

 

 

 

 
 

million); Peru ($10.2 million); and Tunisia ($4.5
million).

Since 1975, the Bank has had a Project Preparation Facility (PPF), created to help overcome
weaknesses in borrowers’ capacities to complete
project preparation and to support the entities
responsible for preparing or carrying out projects. Under the facility, the Bank advances funds
to meet gaps in project preparation and for institution building. During the year. advances from
the PPF amounted to $33.9 million. At the end
of the fiscal year, commitments. net of the amount
of advances refinanced under subsequent loans
and credits, stood at $64.1 million, against a net
commitment authority of $99.5 million authorized by the Executive Directors in August 1981.

While the Bank’s lending operations. including the PPF, are the major channels for the provision of technical assistance to its member
countries. there are a number of other mechanisms that figure prominently in the Bank’s overall
technical-assistance effort. Among these is the
program announced in fiscal 1982 to place and
fund up to twenty staff in technical-assistance
advisory positions in [DA-cligible countries.
Three of these advisers took up positions (in
Bangladesh, Senegal, and Nepal) in fiscal 1983.
Commitments were made on nine more advisers—two each for Benin and Togo, and one each
in the Central African Republic. Chad, Equatorial Guinea, The Gambia. and Sierra Leone.

The Bank continued to serve as executing
agency for projects financed by the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP); the
number in progress at the end of the year stood
at 127, down from 132 a year earlier. The technical assistance provided under these projects
exceeds $160 million. Some thirty-three new
projects, involving commitments of $33.1 million. were approved during the vear: in fiscal 1982.
the number was thirty-seven. with commitments
of $41.8 million. The decline in UNDP projects
reflects the continuing shortfall in donor contributions to that organization. the world’s leading
source of grant technical ance, _

Despite its funding difficulties. the UNDP
agreed to finance, and to designate the Bank as
executing agency of, a number of large and innovative projects during fiscal 1983. One of these,
the preparation of a Water Sector Master Planin
Bangladesh, will utilize one of the largest grants
($6.6 million) the UNDP has ever made. Among
the other large UNDP projects approved during
the past year were a planning project in Gabon
($3.5 million) and assistance to the Uganda
Development Bank ($2.0 million). In both of
these projects, more than 85 percent of the needed
resources are being provided as “cost-sharing”
from other sources (an IDA credit in the case of
Uganda and other government funds in the caseof Gabon). About one-third of Bank-executed
UNDP projects now involve some form of costsharing, most of which is provided by governments out of the proceeds of IBRD loans and IDA
credits.

The Bank’s first activity in St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, a study of a hydroelectric scheme,
was launched during the past year, utilizing a
$500,000 grant from the UNDP.

In order to enhance economic management and
assist in the preparation and execution of investment projects in the small island states of the
Caribbean, the Bank agreed to serve as executing agency for a $2.4 million Inter-Agency Resident Mission program in the region, involving
cost-sharing contributions from the International Monetary Fund, the United States, and
Canada, in addition to financing provided by the
Bank and the UNDP.

In recent years, the Bank and the UNDP have
worked closely on a number of innovative projects, classified by the UNDP as global and
interregional. Many of these earlier arrangements continued, and during the past year, the
UNDP provided new funding for a Study of
Options and Investment Priorities in Irrigation
Development; for a series of Power System Loss
Reduction Studies; and for an EDI-run training
project in energy and power (held in Turkey, in
February/March for participants from throughout the Mediterranean area).

In the biggest of its global/interregional undertakings, the Bank and the UNDP reached agreement during the year on an Energy Sector
Management Program expected to cost $47 million over four years. The program is an outgrowth
and continuation of the sixty-country Energy
Assessment Program jointly launched by the two
organizations in November 1980. The new program was inaugurated in March 1983 on the basis
of resources then available; the bulk of needed
resources is being sought from other sources in the
donor community.

Reimbursable Technical Assistance

The Bank’s technical cooperation is extended
to capital-surplus developing countries in the
Europe. Middle East. and North Africa region
on a reimbursable basis when the annual program exceeds one staffyear of Bank input. such
as in the case of Saudi Arabia, Oman, and the
United Arab Emirates, and on a nonreimbursable basis in response to ad hoc requests for programs requiring less than one staffyear. In fiscal
1983, about twenty-nine staffyears of reimbursable technical assistance were provided by the
Bank.

Saudi Arabia received more than twenty-five
staffyears of reimbursable technical assistance,

Bank Activities 49

thus comprising about 86 percent of the 1983
reimbursable program. The activities were provided to several ministries and agencies and covered various sectors and subsectors such as human
resources, systems and computer analysis, infrastructure, and engineering. Oman received over
two staffyears of assistance, including 1.5 staffyears of field-stationed specialist services, mainly
for the establishment of a manpower-planning
unit in the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor.
Two new reimbursable technical-assistance programs were initiated in fiscal 1983. one in the
United Arab Emirates for the establishment of a
Labor Information System in the Ministry of
Labor and Social Affairs and one in Libya for a
special economic study and an ED course in
project evaluation.

The Bank also provided nonreimbursable
technical assistance to the United Arab Emirates, in the form of a general economic review and
a preliminary study prior to the conclusion of the
technical-cooperation agreement on the Labor
Information System, and to Bahrain, for an
energy-policies study.

Interorganizational Cooperation

The need for cooperation among international development-assistance institutions continues to grow as worldwide economic constraints
limit the potential impact on development of
individual governments and agencies. To address
the aid needs that exist in a variety of socioeconomic sectors and geographic regions, collaboration between the Bank and other institutions
includes a wide range of arrangements, from ad
hoc programs set up to address specific sector or
regional problems or needs, to formal agreements such as the cooperative programs with the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN
(FAO), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). the United Nations
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (Unesco). and the World Health Organization (WHO).

Lending for the development of energy
resources continues to be a worldwide sectoral
priority. Accordingly, the response to the joint
World Bank/United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Energy Sector Assessment
Program has been strong; by the end of the fiscal
year, thirteen assessments had been completed
and eighteen were under way. Governments are
making extensive use of the advice in the Assessment Reports. and many have requested further
assistance.

In response, the Bank and the UNDP have
recently launched an Energy Sector Management Program, which will provide up to $1 million to countries that have had assessments for
assistance in improving governments’ ability to50 Bank Policies, Activities, and Finances

 

manage their energy sectors. prefeasibility work
on priority investment plans, and short-term
assistance in institutional and manpower development.

Increasing worldwide attention is also focusing on the social sectors. This past year. the Bank
continued to cooperate with WHO and other
agencies in the Diarrhoeal Diseases Control
Programme and in the preparatory committee for
the Health Resources Group. The Bank also
sponsors, jointly with WHO and the UNDP. the
Special Program for Research and Training in
Tropical Diseases. for which WHO is the executing agency. The Bank has been supporting this
program financially since fiscal 1981.

In the environmental field, the Bank continued its active interorganizational cooperation.
Close collaborative relationships with the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
included the Regional Seas Impact Assessment
and Environmental Guidelines and Training.
among many others. The Bank continued its
leadership role in the work of the Committee on
International Development Assistance Institutions on the Environment. through which the
Bank assists the member institutions in strengthening their capacity for handling the environmental dimension of development.

The Office of Environmental Affairs worked
with WHO on a continuing series of guidelines
for environmental health in the development
process and on advising the Ecological Panel of
the Onchocerciasis Control Program: with the
International Labour Organisation (ILO) on
several technical matters relating to occupational health and worker safety: with UNIDO on
pollution-control guidelines for industry: with the
Organisation for Economie Co-operation and
Development (OECD) in helping the bilateralaid programs of its members strengthen their
capacity for dealing with environmental and
development issues and harmonizing their environmental policies: with the Commission of the
European Communities to establish an environmental affairs office: with FAO/UNDP on environmental management for vector and disease
control: and with the Organization of American
States (OAS) on control of oil pollution in the
Caribbean basin. In addition. the Office worked
directly with bilateral development-assistance
agencies (in Canada, Norway, and the United
States. for example) on environmental-assessments training. policy development. and matters
relating to the environment in recipient countries.

In support of the UN International Drinking
Water Supply and Sanitation Decade. the Bank’s
Transportation and Water Department collaborated extensively with other agencies in a range
of special activities, including investment proj
ects and training in low-cost sanitation, development of rural water-supply handpumps,
research and development in integrated resource
recovery, and the establishment of regional offices
to assist governments in project preparation.

This past year. the Bank’s relations with the
ILO further expanded. The Bank and ILO jointly
organized a special training course for training
officers of ministries of public works from Latin
America. A series of seminars and workshops was
organized in the Bank to present the [LO’s Management Development Program. and ILO staff
contributed to the 1983 edition of the World
Development Report on development of management competence. Close cooperation with the
ILO continued in the area of development of
modular approaches to vocational and management training. and the Bank has undertaken to
finance the ILO production of new guidelines for
space requirements and equipment in vocational
workshops. laboratories, and classrooms.

On a regional basis. the Bank has strengthened cooperative efforts in those areas with particular development difficulties and little recourse
to other sources of aid.

In fiscal 1983, an interagency resident mission
(LARM) was established in Antigua for the purpose of supplementing the development efforts
of the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development by addressing the specific
needs of the seven less-developed countries of the
Eastern Caribbean. As executing agency. the
Bank will cooperate closely with other agencies*
in providing development assistance. facilitating
aid flows and the execution of investment projects, and in assisting the Organization of Eastern
Caribbean States and the Caribbean Development Bank to strengthen their capacity to assume
their service role in the IARM.

In Eastern Africa. the Bank took measures to
strengthen ties with the Economic Community of
the Great Lakes Countries. As part of its economic and sector-work program, the Bank is
executing three regional cooperation studies: :
farming-systems study, an industrial-sector stud)
and a study of the Great Lakes Community
Institutions. Particular interest in the last-named
study stems from the Bank’s increased awareness of the need to adopt an integrated regional
approach to the development problems facing the
three countries of the Community (Burundi,
Rwanda, and Zaire).

meet 75 percent of the costs of the Cooperative
Programs (CPs) with FAO. Unesco. WHO. and
UNIDO. Its aggregate share during the past year
was $9.2 million.

In the nineteen years since its establishment,
the Bank/FAO Cooperative Program has participated in the formulation of over 300 Bankassisted projects. During fiscal year 1983, the CP
fielded eighty-eight missions in thirty-six countries, and also participated in seventy-five Bank
appraisal. supervision, and sector-survey missions. It collaborated in the preparation of 29
percent of all agriculture and rural development
projects approved for Bank financing during the
year. Special importance is attached by the CP to
increasing its activities in the poorest countries.
for example, the Sahelian countries of Africa.
Bangladesh, the Yemen Arab Republic. and the
People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen. While
most of the projects on which the CP is working
continue to be for rural development and irrigation. more emphasis is being given to agricultural credit, livestock, and, in particular, forestry.
The CP is also increasingly ing borrowers on
technical aspects of ongoing projects.

The Bank/Unesco CP. established in 1964,
continues to facilitate the financing of education
projects in developing countries that are members of both organizations. Under the current
arrangement, the Unesco CP assists in sector work
and project-preparation tasks and. as necessary.
in project appraisal and supervision: in recent
years. it has also become more involved in project-completion work. In fiscal 1983, the CP
assisted primarily in project-preparation work:
secondly, in sector work and project completion: and finally, in project-identification,
appraisal, and supervision work, and Unesco
Secretariat activities.

As in previous years. the Bank continued to
interact with other Unesco units. especially the
Unesco Statistical Office, the Science Policy
Division, and the Higher Education Division, and
with the International Institute for Educational
Planning.

During the past year, the Bank/UNIDO CP
shifted its focus from staff support for Bank-initiated sectoral studies and project work in various countries to developing collaboration
between the two institutions for more effective
utilization of their comparative strengths for the
benefit of member countries. Special attention
was devoted to exploring ways in which UNIDO
might provide technical assistance to Bankassisted projects. Technical staff in UNIDO’s
Industrial Operations Division, which has
responsibility for organizing technical assistance
financed through various sources, are now closely
involved with work that is directly relevant to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   
 

Bank Activities ot

ongoing or proposed Bank-assisted projects in
several member countries.

Begun in 1971, the Bank/WHO CP focused in
its early stages on sector studies, with additional
involvement in preinvestment studies and project preparation, to define needs in the field of
water supply and sanitation. The detailed sector
studies were followed by “rapid assessment survevs”’ of the water and sanitation situation in
numerous countries in preparation for the United
Nations International Drinking Water Supply and
Sanitation Decade. Since most of the studies have
now been completed, the CP has begun to
decrease its activities. A few new studies have
been conducted in Latin America. West Africa,
and in India. and the Bank has updated prior work
on other countries through project work or specific assignments. Having accomplished the goals
for which it was set up, the current program is
gradually being phased out, and it is scheduled
to terminate in mid-1984. The Bank is developing, however, cooperative relationships with
WHO and its regional organizations in the health
sector; these relationships are expected to remain
informal.

Cooperation with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) involved in development <
ance and education expanded and took ona new
dimension during fiscal 1983. Bank staff and the
Bank-NGO committee increased their efforts to
strengthen cooperation by educating both Bank
and NGO staff about policies and procedures of
the Bank and the many NGOs and by identifying
specific opportunities for cooperation at the
country, sector, and project levels. The types of
Bank-NGO operational associations ranged from
planned and contractual NGO roles in Banked projects to provision of parallel inputs and
informal consultations on project design. Cooperation on project work focused mainly on the
agricultural sector. although work in the fields of
education and urban development continued, as
well. Nonproject operational cooperation
involved mostly sector studies. In the field of
development education, the Bank supported
information activities carried out by NGOs, particularly in industrial countries.

The initial phase of the Bank-NGO dialogue
can now be considered successfully concluded:
The cooperation policy has been enunciated:
an information and consultative network has
been set up: models for country/sector reviews
have been developed: a mechanism to monitor
Bank-NGO cooperation at the project level is
in place at the Bank. Accordingly, the BankNGO Committee will consider expanding the
policy dialogue to include. for example, issues
on the international economic agenda.

Cooperation in agricultural research. Agricultural production is a critical factor in develop

ment in the poor countries of the world.
Production can be increased by expanding the
area under cultivation, by using more labor,
nutrients, and water, or by improving the efficiency of these inputs. Historically, increased
production has been achieved primarily by
bringing more land under the plow. In the past
twenty years, however, with accelerating land
pressure, two-thirds of the growth in agricultural
output in the major producing regions of Asia,
the Middle East. and North Africa has resulted
from higher output per unit of land. In Africa,
most of the growth has come from opening up new
land. Although there are large areas of unused
but potentially arable land in the developing
countries, in much of it there are serious biological and physical constraints to cultivation. The
land is also often inaccessible to farmers and
markets. In regions where food needs are greatest, as in Asia and the Middle East, there is little
unused land. Inputs are expensive. and their use
is sometimes associated with greater risk. A
sophisticated infrastructure is often needed to
make them available to farmers. Consequently,
making agriculture more efficient will remain the
key to meeting the world’s food needs. Increasing efficiency is the role of agricultural research.

The objective of the international research
centers supported by the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)
is to develop technologies farmers in developing
countries can use to grow more food. The
CGIAR. sponsored by the World Bank, the FAO.
and the UNDP. is an informal association of
donor countries. private foundations. multilateral development agencies. and countries representing the developing regions of the world. Its
thirty-six donor members will be providing an
estimated $165 million in calendar 1983, of which
the Bank is expected to contribute $19 million.
to thirteen international agricultural research
institutions.

The network of activities supported by the
Group includes nine international research institutes. all based in developing countries and staffed
and equipped to high international standards.
These institutes carry out research on all important food crops. on livestock, and farming systems. They also maintain an important training
function. In addition. the Group supports a
worldwide effort to collect. conserve. and use
genetic materials and supports research on rice
by an association of West African governments
and research on food policy. Technical assistance is also provided to developing countries in
the design and implementation of their own agricultural-research systems.

In the last few years. the work of the CGIAR
and the international centers has received recognition from both developed and developing

 

countries. In 1980, the CGIAR was awarded
Belgium’s King Baudouin International Development Prize for having made a unique and lasting contribution to development. In April 1983,
the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)
was awarded the Third World Prize for 1982 by
the Third World Foundation for Social and Economic Studies, an organization formed to represent the viewpoint of the developing countries.
IRRI, established in 1960 in the Philippines, has
developed new rice varieties that combine greater
resistance to insects and diseases with yield
potential double and triple that of the varieties
previously available. These “modern” varieties
have been widely adopted by the eleven most
populous countries of South and Southeast Asia.
They are now grown on 40 percent of the total
rice area in those countries and generate about
$1.5 billion a year in increased rice production.

In acknowledgement of its work on the African continent, the International Livestock Center for Africa (ILCA) received two awards this
past year: the Gold Mercury International Prize
from an association of African countries and the
Malbrant Feunteun Prize from the Académie
Vétérinaire de France.

Economic Research and Studies

The World Bank devoted about 3.3 percent of
its administrative budget, roughly $17.3 million,
in fiscal 1983 to economic and social research.
Since the formal inception of the research program eleven years ago, 159 research projects,
including twenty-two in the past vear. have been
completed. Some 150 centrally approved and
funded research projects are currently in progress, and an additional sixty-five smaller projects
are being conducted by research units within Bank
departments.

Research is undertaken by the Bank’s own
research staff, usually in collaboration with other
researchers. Except in collaborative projects, the
Bank does not provide funds to outside institutions or individuals for economic and social
research.

The program of research is shaped by the
Bank’s own needs as a lending institution and as
a source of policy advice to member governments. and by the needs of member countries. Its
main purposes are to gain new insights into the
development process and the policies affecting it,
to introduce new techniques or methodologies
into country, sectoral. and project analyses, to
provide the analytical bases for major Bank documents such as the World Development Report,
and to help strengthen indigenous research
capacity in member developing countries.

In fiscal 1983. thirty-three new research starts
were made, including nineteen grants for the
preparation of research proposals. This prepar-atory facility, which is relatively new, is designed
to allow researchers scope for exploration of issues
on the cutting edge of research, to enhance the
research capacity of units within the operations
complex of the Bank, to carry out some pilot
analysis, and to visit member countries to negotiate collaborative arrangements for research.
Also, in fiscal 1983, some twenty new or ongoing
research projects involved the application of
earlier research findings in new contexts in order
to test their broadened applicability or to expedite and hasten the dissemination of results. The
successful application of a research technique
generally leads to its becoming part of the stockin-trade of Bank analysts who no longer consider
such an activity as research. but as part of operating procedures.

In the past year, a reorganization of the staff
and management of the research program led to
the creation of a research department in the
Economics and Research Staff (ERS), a new
Country Policy Department in the Operations
Policy Staff (OPS). and new or strengthened
research units in OPS departments, and in the
Energy and Industry departments. Also during
this period, a new Vice-President, Economics and
Research Staff, assumed responsibility for
developing and guiding the Bankwide research
program.

The thrust of the reorganization was to give
greater emphasis to those research activities that
have a more direct and immediate payoff in terms
of the Bank’s daily operational requirements. By
the end of fiscal 1983 and as currently projected
for fiscal 1984, economic and social research
within the Bank was (and will be) almost evenly
distributed between the Economics and Research
Staff and the Operations Policy Staff. Previously, about two-thirds of the research activity was
carried out by the Development Policy Staff, the
predecessor to ERS.

The intent of the realignment is to give greater
weight to the following two objectives: improvement in the Bank's capacity to give policy advice
to member countries and further development of
local research capacity in member countries. In
support of the latter, the Bank’s criteria for
selecting research projects were altered to
encourage more collaborative projects involving
researchers and institutions in developing countries to the maximum extent possible. Indications are that such personnel and institutions will
be increasingly tapped for the conceptualization, execution, and evaluation of a larger share
of the research portfolio. For example, funding
for recently approved projects on the determinants of fertility in Bangladesh, tax systems in
Mexico and Pakistan, and public enterprises in
China was contingent upon involvement with onsite collaborators from the countries under study.

 

 

Bank Activities 53

While the broad objectives of Bank research
have not changed, the ordering of the priorities
has varied. In the wake of the current reorganization, the research program’s priorities are being
reassessed in view of the growing perception of
the need for more applied research, increased
emphasis on research on the international economy as the context for domestic economic policy, and multicountry comparative studies of
development policy.

Until now, the program has tended to focus on
issues and questions that pertain to sectors around
which Bank lending has usually been organized.
A revised orientation follows from the fact that
many policy questions are relevant across sectors and that the units of economic analysis are
not always confined to a single sector. In terms
of the program’s emerging priorities. issues are
increasingly being identified in the areas of
international trade and finance, public economics, household economics, and technology. These
issues are important to countries in all regions of
the world: however, in'accordance with the Bank’s
special emphasis on Africa, major efforts are
being made to address these issues in an African
context. Research on issues related to energy and
to structural adjustment also continue to merit
special attention.

In the face of budgetary stringency as a result
of the worldwide recession and related stagnation of world trade and retrenchment of commercial lending, member countries are seeking
advice on the impact of alternative policies
affecting growth and welfare. Analyzing the tradeoffs implicit in such choices has become an
important part of the research program. In the
past three years, the amount of research resources
devoted to development policy and planning has
risen from 14 percent to 23 percent of the budget. As part of that effort, computable general
equilibrium models developed for the economies of the Ivory Coast, Turkey, and Yugoslavia
are being transferred to those countries for their
continuing use and application by researchers
there trained by Bank staff.

The importance of designing policies that permit developing countries to cope more effectively with fluctuations and adverse trends in the
international environment has prompted the
research program to look at wider issues in international trade, particularly those surrounding
impediments to trade in services and labor
migration. The impact of migrating labor on host
and beneficiary economies continues to be
investigated.

A large part of the analytical work and research
activities of the Bank is concerned with the role
and effect of government interventions on economic development. Most research has been
aimed at market-oriented economies. but a few54 Bank Policies, Activities, and Finances

 

recent studies are looking at the methods by which
the resources in centrally planned economies can
be allocated more rationally. State-owned
enterprises is the major collaborative research
topic undertaken with the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences.

In the social sectors, the pricing of public services and the difficulties associated with achieving
a balance between recovering recurrent costs
without putting service beyond the reach of lowincome families have been the focus of Bank
research. New research is under way in the areas
of charging for irrigation water. deregulation of
the transport sector. the costs and methods of
controlling congestion, and new mechanisms for
the efficient management and contro] of supplying water and disposing of waste.

With the household recognized as an integrated unit of economic analysis and with
improvements in the design of survey instruments. a larger number of research initiatives are
looking at household behavior. particularly in
estimating demand for public services—education, health services. water and sanitation services. and personal travel. The importance of
interhousehold transfers of money and goods has
been highlighted as a source of savings and
investment for poor families, notably those
headed by women, and warrants more research.

The use of advanced technology in promoting
increased production. as a source of growth and
efficiency. and of disseminating information and
educational material in developing countries is
also receiving more scrutiny. Typically. such
research projects are costly and are, therefore,
more likely to involve collaboration at some stage
with other development-oriented institutions.

All centrally funded research projects in progress are described in the annual publication,
Abstracts of Current Studies: The World Bank
Research Program. The results of completed Bank
research appear in a variety of formats, including
articles in professional journals. books published
under World Bank auspices or by independent
publishers, and World Bank Staff Working Papers.
The World Bank Catalog of Publications provides
information on material issued by. or on behalf of,
the World Bank. World Bank Research News, a
thrice-yearly bulletin now in its fourth year of publication, gives news of research projects being
started, describes the findings of studies as they are
completed. and includes a feature article surveying a particular area of Bank research. It is distributed to more than 12.000 individuals in
governments, research institutions, and other
organizations in the field of development.

 

 

 

Operations Evaluation

In fiscal 1983. the Bank adopted a selective
system of project-performance auditing. Under

the modified system. member governments and
Executive Directors continued to receive staff
reports on the outcome of all completed projects. These project-completion reports (PCRs)
are read by staff of the independent Operations
Evaluation Department (OED). and borrowers’
comments are sought for all completed projects.
About 55 percent of the projects reviewed were
subjected to performance audit by OED staff
during fiscal 1983. The criteria for selection as
applied by OED have been approved by the Joint
Audit Committee of the Executive Directors.

The new system of selected auditing does not
jeopardize the integrity of the Bank’s projectevaluation system. There is sufficient evidence
that project-completion reporting by operational staff is now firmly established in the Bank
and that major inadequacies are being spotted by
OED’s evaluation officers. who continue to
scrutinize all PCRs.

During fiscal 1983. borrowers not only made
increasing contributions to project-completion
reports, but commented on most project-performance audits prepared by OED. as well.
Project-evaluation capacities in several borrowing countries were initiated or strengthened with
support from the Bank and OED. Borrowers’
representatives visited OED for associative
training and attended courses on monitoring and
evaluation arranged by the Economic Development Institute.

Ninety-two projects were subjected to performance audits in fiscal 1983. bringing the
cumulative total of completed projects evaluated by OED to 872. In addition. seventy-six
project-completion reports (covering seventyeight projects) were passed on to the Executive
Directors after scrutiny by OED. but without
OED audit. Reflecting the expansion of Bank
operations in the mid- and late 1970s, the number of project-completion reports submitted by
the Bank’s operating departments to OED is
expected to increase to approximately 240 in fiscal 1984.

The ultimate objective of Bank evaluation
continues to be to identify and disseminate lessons that can contribute to improvements in the
design and implementation of future Bank-supported projects. By bringing together experience with similar projects, lessons can be more
readily drawn and more efficiently confirmed and
disseminated. The Annual Review of Project
Performance Audit Results continues, as in the
past. to be a valuable mechanism for summarizing experience by sector and. through a process
of review with operating staff. bringing that
experience to bear on the design of future projects.

OED’s eighth Annual Review of Project Performance Audit Results was published inDecember 1982. It dealt with the experience of
108 operations supported by IBRD loans and IDA
credits. The total amount of IBRD and IDA
finance provided for these projects was approximately $3,200 million; the total cost of the projects assisted was approximately $11,300 million.
As in earlier reviews, the Eighth Review concluded that these projects were. with few exceptions, either successful in achieving their principal objectives, or were well on their way to doing
so. and that they had contributed substantially to
the development of both material and human
resources in the countries concerned.

However, more than half of the projects were
changed during implementation and experienced time and cost overruns. The dominant
reason for these changes was the high rate of
inflation in the mid- and late-1970s, which often
led to a reduction in project scope in order to keep
down total expenditures. Some of these changes
reflected built-in flexibility in design and implementation management; but there were others
that were judged as having initially deficient
project preparation and design. A number of
projects were also affected by weak management. general instability of economic conditions. and political changes in the countries in
which they were located. Many of the lessons of
the projects covered in the Eighth Annual Review
are similar to those noted in earlier reviews: the
importance of full understanding and agreement
between the Bank and borrower on project
objectives and the institutional arrangements for
achieving them: project designs that are realistic
and responsive to local conditions; and borrower
policies that are conducive to the success of the
project within a longer-term plan of development.

Parallel with the project-performance auditing system, OED continued to prepare special
studies. A number of such studies were completed during fiscal 1983: they were reviewed by
the Joint Audit Committee of the Executive
Directors, and some were also discussed in the full
Board.

The Joint Audit Committee maintains continuing oversight of the OED work program and of
its effectiveness. The conclusions of the Joint
Audit Committee, the annual report of the
Director-General, Operations Evalution. on the
status of the Bank’s evaluation system, and OED’s
Annual Review of Project Performance Audit
Results were all reviewed by the Executive
Directors.

 

 

 

Internal Auditing

Internal auditing is an independent appraisal
function within the World Bank that examines and
evaluates Bank activities as a service to the Bank,
with particular emphasis on examining, report
Bank Activities 5o

ing on, and where necessary. recommending
improvements concerning the adequacy and
effectiveness of the Bank’s system of internal
control. This appraisal function is accomplished
through operational audits of the financial and
operating systems and procedures used in the
conduct and management of the Bank’s operations. The principal objective of the Internal
Auditing Department (IAD) is to assist the vicepresidents, department directors, and other
managers in the effective discharge of their
responsibilities by furnishing them with periodic
reports on independent audits and appraisals
carried out on activities within their respective
areas of responsibility. Other departmental
objectives include the identification of possible
means of improving the efficiency and economy
of operations and use of resources.

In carrying out operational audits, the department’s examination and evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the systems,
procedures, and internal controls used in the
conduct and management of an activity include
the review and determination of the reliability and
integrity of financial and operating information
and the means used to identify. measure. classify, and report such information. [AD also
reviews the systems established to ensure compliance with those governing agreements,
instruments, and related decisions. regulations,
policies, plans, and procedures that could have a
significant impact on operations and reports, and
determines the extent of such comphance. The
means of safeguarding Bank assets from various
types of losses are reviewed. and each audit also
includes an appraisal of the efficiency and economy with which resources are used, where
appropriate.

The work program designed to achieve the
objectives of the department covers a broad range
of activities covering financial. accounting.
administrative, data processing, and the supervisory aspects of IBRD loans and IDA credits
under disbursement. Some of these activities are
reviewed annually, others biennially or less frequently depending upon the materiality or risk
aspects of the activity. In addition, [AD’s work
program includes special assignments requested
by Bank management.

The audits of electronic data-processing (EDP)
and project-supervision systems form an important part of the department’s work program. The
ystems audits include the review of con. security, and efficiency of computer facilities and information-processing systems in
operation and those under development. [AD’s
involvement in the development of new EDPinformation systems before they become operational provides a timely and cost-effective

opportunity for an independent assessment of the56 Bank Policies, Activities, and Finances

operational and control aspects of such systems.
The department has also recently started to carry
out effectiveness reviews of major EDP systems
to determine whether the systems are functioning as intended. Project-supervision activities are
selected for audit on a sectoral/regional basis and
are reviewed in the light of existing policies and
guidelines established by the Bank.

The implementation of recommendations
arising from its review work are followed up by
IAD, and the department advises Bank management where such recommendations are not being
acted upon and on the effects or risks associated
with such inaction. The review work of [AD also
includes visits to selected countries to review the
auditing standards applied by borrowers’ external auditors, to review internal-auditing and
financial-reporting standards of selected bortowers, and to upgrade national auditing and
accounting education and practices in countries
where they might be needed.

In carrying out each assignment, the director
and staff of the department have unrestricted

access to all Bank records, documents. and personnel relevant to the activity under review.
Where relevant, LAD coordinates its work with
the Bank’s external auditors and makes its working papers and reports available to assist them in
planning and coordinating their examinations of
the annuai financial statements of the Bank.
The IAD reports administratively to the Senior Vice President, Finance. but, in order to
enhance its independence, the director also has
direct access to the President and to the Joint
Audit Committee (JAC) of the Executive Directors. The results of each audit undertaken are
reported to the vice presidents. department
directors, and others concerned, as it is considered appropriate. Liaison is maintained with the
JAC, which has the responsibility of satisfying
itself that the Bank’s internal-auditing function
is adequate and efficient. In this context. the JAC
reviews the department’s master work program
and annual work program, receives periodic
briefings on its activities, and a subcommittee of
the JAC reviews selected reports of the LAD.Bank Finances

Fiscal 1983 was characterized by a series of
financial achievements and new financial developments for the IBRD. These include record high
amounts for gross revenues, net income, liquid
assets, and borrowings; the introduction of programs of lending at variable rates and borrowing
in the short-term capital markets; and notable
expansions of currency-swap transactions and the
lending of portfolio securities.

Income, Expenditures, and Reserves:
IBRD

The IBRD’s gross revenues, generated primarily from its loans and investments, reached a
total of $4,232 million in fiscal 1983, up $860 million, or 26 percent, from last year. Gross revenues have risen steadily during the last decade as
loan and investment balances have continued to
expand.

The outstanding loan portfolio totaled $33,747
million at the end of the fiscal year, an increase
of $4,580 million over fiscal 1982. The average
interest rate on outstanding loans during the year
was 7.9 percent, producing income of $2.487
million. In addition. commitment charges on
undisbursed loan balances produced $213 million, and front-end fees earned on new loans, $97
million. Altogether, the income on loans was
$2,797 million. In fiscal 1982, the average interest rate was 7.6 percent, interest income was
$2,161 million, commitment charges were $191
million, and front-end fees were $39 million. for
a total of $2,391 million.

In July 1982, the IBRD instituted a new poolbased variable-rate lending system. It applies to
loans for which invitations to negotiate were sent
after July 1, 1982. The new system uniformly
adjusts interest charges applicable to outstanding balances on all loans made under it. All borrowers under this new system equitably share the
benefits of a decline, or the burden of an increase,
in borrowing costs—not just those who receive
new loan commitments. Under the new system.
the lending rate is adjusted semi-annually. on
January 1 and July 1. by adding a spread of 0.50
percent to the IBRD’s average cost of a “pool”
of qualified borrowings. The pool consists of
outstanding borrowings of the [BRD settled since
June 30, 1982 plus, until June 30, 1985, outstanding borrowings undertaken in fiscal 1982.
These fiscal 1982 borrowings were included tem
 

Bank Finances S7

porarily in order to moderate rate volatility while
the pool of borrowings to which the variable rate
applies builds up.

The new system has worked to the advantage
of borrowers as a whole during the first year of
operation. Borrowing costs declined. as fears
about increased volatility of IBRD lending rates
were not realized. The initial variable lending rate
was 11.43 percent. On January 1. 1983 it was
reduced to 10.97 percent. On July 1, the lending
rate was set at 10.47 percent. The variable lending-rate system has also enabled the IBRD to
make substantial progress in reducing the “overhang” of undisbursed loans carrying fixed-rate
disbursement obligations, which might differ
markedly from the actual cost of financing.

In August 1982, the Executive Directors
authorized a new short-term borrowing program, with a $1.5 billion ceiling on notes outstanding. The notes could have maturities of up
to one year. The objectives were to achieve
additional financial flexibility by gaining access
to the growing market for short-term instruments and its diverse customers and to reduce the
overall cost of funds through lower-cost borrowings in that market. The IBRD’s first short-term
notes were sold in the United States market on
September 29, 1982, and the ceiling was reached
within a month. The IBRD’s short-term notes
have been widely accepted as a premier credit and
generally have been sold and traded competitively within the price range for the highest quaiity short-term securities. The IBRD’s average cost
of short-term note borrowings was about 250 basis
points lower than the cost of the planned alternative—intermediate-term US-dollar borrowings—and in late April, 1983, the Executive
Directors raised the authorized ceiling to $2.0
billion. On June 30. 1983. outstanding short-term
notes totaled $1.5 billion.

Favorable financial experience in the first part
of the fiscal year produced an improved outlook
for the IBRD’s profitability for the year and led
the IBRD to reduce the 1.5 percent front-end fee
on new loan commitments. The front-end fee was
introduced early in calendar 1982 to forestall a
potential decline. primarily from volatilit
movements of interest and exchange rates. in the
Bank's net income over the medium-term. The
fee was lowered to 0.75 percent on December 7.
1982, and to 0.25 percent on March 1, 1983. It is
a one-time fee agreed to at the time of a loan58 Bank Policies, Activities, and Finances

 

commitment which can. at the borrower's option,
be capitalized and added to the loan amount,
thereby allowing the additional burden to be
spread over the life of the loan. The IBRD will
continue to review the front-end fee and other
loan charges periodically to determine whether
future adjustments are desirable.

The IBRD has aimed at maintaining a liquid
position of marketable short-term assets equal to
40 percent of estimated net cash requirements for
the next three years. In May 1983. the Executive
Directors reviewed that policy and decided upon
a target liquidity range of between 40 percent and
45 percent. including maturing short-term notes.
This liquidity policy is designed to assure flexibility in the IBRD’s borrowing decisions and to
permit it to meet adequately its cash requirements in case borrowing operations are temporarily affected by adverse conditions in the capital
markets. At June 30, 1983, liquid assets aggregated $13,196 million net of commitments for
settlements and cash collateral received on loaned
securities. an increase of $3,802 million over June
30, 1982. The IBRD invests its liquid assets
throughout the year. In fiscal 1983, these investments yielded an average realized rate of return
of 12.15 percent and generated $1.417 million of
investment income, compared with 11.25 percent and $954 million in fiscal 1982.

Initiated in fiscal 1982, the securities-lending
program grew this past year. This program produced over $22 million in additional income this
past year. and a total of over $30 million since its
inception in January 1982. Under this program.
the IBRD lends its securities to primary security
deaiers and to the Federal Reserve system for its
open-market operations. Each of these security
loans is secured by collateral of at least equal
market value delivered to the IBRD by the borrower. If the collateral is another security. then
the IBRD earns a fee on the transaction. If cash
is given as collateral. the IBRD earns income by
reinvesting this cash in the monev markets. Legal
agreements covering these transactions with a
select group of primary dealers further guarantee the safety of these security loans,

An additional $18 million of revenues was
derived from other income.

Expenditures of the IBRD, which include
administrative expenses, interest. contributions
to special programs, and issuance costs on borrowings. totaled $3.480 million, up 25 percent
from last vear. Costs associated with the IBRD’s
increased borrowings—interest of $3,085 million and bond-issuance charges and other financial expenses of $50 million—were by far the
major expenditures. Administrative costs totaled
$322 million. up $32 million, after deducting $214
million for the management fee charged to the
International Development Association and $3.7

 

  
 
 

million for the service-and-support fee charged
to the International Finance Corporation.

Net income for fiscal 1983 was $752 million, up
$154 million from the year before. The 26 percent increase was largely due to high rates of
return on the IBRD’s liquidity. These were caused
in part by capital gains resulting from the substantial decline in interest rates experienced in the
fiscal year, a decline which is not expected to recur
in the near future. Other factors that made a major
contribution to the rise in net income were: the
IBRD’s substantial access to low-cost currencies, which is discussed later under ‘‘Borrowings’; the initiation of the short-term note
program with attendant low borrowing costs and
positive spreads on the investment of the proceeds of those borrowings; and proceeds from the
securities-lending program described earlier.

During fiscal 1983, $303 million was added to
the General Reserve of the IBRD. bringing the
total to $3,134 million. Of the $598 million in net
income earned in fiscal 1982. $125 million was
allocated by the Board of Governors as a grant
to IDA: the remaining $473 million was allocated to the General Reserve.

The IBRD does not trade in any currencies for
its own account. Adjustments arising from
translation of currencies to US-dollar equivalents do not result in realized gains or losses as
would occur with actual conversions into US
dollars. Because of this, the General Reserve.
rather than net income, is charged or credited
annually with the amount of adjustment resulting from currency depreciations or appreciations. In fiscal 1983, the translation of currencies
into US-dollar equivalents resulted in a debit to
the General Reserve of $191 million, compared
with $279 million debited in fiscal 1982. (A more
detailed explanation is provided in the “Notes to
Financial Statements.”)

When gold was formaily abolished in 1978 as a
common denominator of the monetary system,
the IBRD began expressing its capital. for purposes of the financial statements. on the basis of
the special drawing right (SDR). Asa result. the
portion paid in US dollars and the national-currency portion of the capital subscriptions released
by certain member countries for lending in US
dollars are revalued at the rate of exchange of the
US dollar to the SDR. The adjustment resulting
from this revaluation is also charged i
credited to, the General Reserv:
these adjustments resulted in a credit to the
General Reserve of $22 million. compared with
$34 million credited in fiscal 1982.

  

 

Other Financial Operations: IBRD

As of June 30, 1983. the IBRD held $69,820
million worth of loans. This amount included
$7.938 million of loans which had been approvedBank Finances

59

 

but not yet become effective, and $977 million of
loans to the International Finance Corporation.
Loans disbursed and outstanding totaled $33,747
million, including $501 million to the International Finance Corporation.

Disbursements on loans to countries totaled
$6,817 million in fiscal 1983, up $491 million over
fiscal 1982. Since the IBRD began operations, it
has disbursed a total of $51.205 million to its borrowing member countries.

Repayments of principal on the IBRD’s loans,
based on exchange rates at the time of disbursement, amounted to $2,167 million in fiscal 1983.
This included $16 million to investors who had
purchased portions of loans. Cumulative loan
repayments as of June 30. 1983. were $16.388
million: $13,438 million to the IBRD and $2,950
million to purchasers of loans.

Borrowings: IBRD

Borrowings in international capital markets
provide a major portion of the funds necessary
for the continued growth of the IBRD’s lending
operations and are supplemented by the other
principal financial resources of the [BRD. which
are its paid-in capital, accumulated earnings. and
loan repayments.

Total borrowings by the IBRD in fiscal 1983.
including short-term notes outstanding on June
30, 1983, amounted to the equivalent of $10,292
million. This record amount of borrowings was
some $1.771 million over fiscal [982 totals. The
higher amount reflects the [BRD’s requirements
resulting from its desire to maintain substantial
liquidity.

During the fiscal year. the IBRD continued to
engage in numerous currency-hedged transactions. commonly referred to as currency swaps.
These transactions are viewed as a means of
increasing the IBRD’s access to Swiss francs,
Deutsche mark, and other currencies. In fiscal
1983, the IBRD executed forty-nine currencyswap transactions aggregating $1,731 million;
$1.116 million was swapped into Swiss francs. $324
million into Deutsche mark. $152 million into
Pounds sterling, $108 million into Netherlands
guilders. and $31 million into Austrian schillings. This compares to a total of $758 million in
fi 1982, when the IBRD initially engaged in
currency-swap transactions: $198 million was
swapped into Deutsche mark and $560 million
into Swiss francs.

In a currency swap, the IBRD. having borrowed in a particular currency (normally US dollars). converts the currency borrowed into another
currency (Swiss francs, for instance) while, at the
same time, entering into a long-term, forwardexchange contract with a counterparty of the highest credit standing. Under the forward-exchange
contract, the IBRD agrees to repurchase the bor

amounts repurchased under the contract correspond to the IBRD’s debt-service obligations on the
borrowing that has been swapped. In this way, the
IBRD effectively borrows the swapped-for currency on a fully hedged basis at a known cost. The
IBRD follows a policy of seeking to raise funds
through swaps at a cost no greater, and frequently
less, than that which it would have paid had it borrowed this currency directly.

IBRD’s intermediate-term dollar borrowings in
the US domestic market have benefited from the
recent move to quality in financial markets. During the year, the trend in the IBRD’s borrowings
in that market was toward narrower spreads over
US Treasury notes of like duration. During the first
half of 1983, the IBRD engaged in several intermediate-term borrowings in the US domestic market. These borrowings sold at considerably lower
spreads over US Treasury notes than those achieved
by the IBRD in the past twenty-five years.

The IBRD sells its securities through direct
placement with governments, government agencies, and central banks, and in the public markets
where securities are offered to investors through
investment-banking firms, merchant banks, or
commercial banks. Of the eighty-six medium-term
and long-term borrowing operations that the IBRD
conducted during fiscal 1983, seventy were public
issues or private placements throughout the world
and accounted for $6,994 million, or 68 percent of
total funds borrowed. The other medium-term and
long-term issues, totaling $1,780 million, or 17
percent of the funds raised, were placed with official sources, namely, member governments of the
IBRD, central banks, and government institutions. Short-term borrowings outstanding on June
30, 1983, totaled $1,501 million.

The IBRD’s securities have been placed with
investors in more than 100 countries in Africa, Asia,
Australia. Europe, the Middle East, and North and
South America. This diversity allows the IBRD
flexibility in selecting the markets that will allow
optimum borrowing conditions and Jessens its
dependence on any specific market.

The $10,292 million borrowed by the IBRD in
fiscal 1983, including $1,501 million of short-term
notes outstanding on June 30, 1983, consisted of the
currencies listed in the table on this page.

Of these borrowings, $9,224 million represented new funds, and $1,068 million represented
refinancing of outstanding medium-term and longterm borrowings.

A total of $2,848 million equivalent of debt, not
including short-term notes, matured during the
year. Additional debt, not including short-term
notes, aggregating $95 million, was retired by means
of sinking-fund and purchase-fund operations.

Outstanding obligations of the IBRD increased
$7,567 million to $39,407 million as of June 30, 1983.
These obligations were denominated in eighteen
different currencies. A summary classification of
outstanding borrowings, by currency at June 30,
1983, is set forth in Appendix E.

of the IBRD’s average outstanding borrowings
was 8.72 percent.

The cost of the IBRD’s average outstanding

Capitalization

The capital stock of the IBRD and the subscriptions thereto of its members are expressed,
under the Articles of Agreement, in terms of the
United States dollar of the weight and fineness in
effect on July 1. 1944 (1944 dollars). Until 1971,
the current United States dollar had the same
value as the 1944 dollar and the special drawing
right (SDR), which was instituted in 1969. In 1972,
the current dollar value of the 1944 dollar and the
SDR increased to $1.08571, and in 1973 to
$1.20635, as the result of devaluations of the dollar. Until mid-1974, both the 1944 dollar and the
SDR continued to be valued in gold and had the
same gold value. Thus, on July 1, 1974, the value
of the SDR. expressed in terms of United States
dollars, was $1.20635. which was the equivalent
of one 1944 dollar.

Since July 1, 1974, when a valuation method
for the SDR that was based on a number of major
currencies was adopted, the SDR’s value has
fluctuated daily against the US dollar. The current dollar value of the 1944 dollar. on the other
hand, was deemed to remain fixed at the rate
established by the US par-value legislation of
1973:

Since the effectiveness on April 1, 1978. of the
Second Amendment ta the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
currencies no longer have par values, and the basis
for translating the 1944 dollar into current United
States dollars no longer exists. The IBRD is
examining the implication of this change on the
valuation of its capital stock and the impact it will
have on its financial statements.

For purposes of its primary financial statements, the [BRD has expressed the value of its
capital stock on the basis of the SDR in terms of
United States dollars as computed by the IMF on
June 30. 1983 ($1.06835 per SDR).

On January 4, 1980, the IBRD’s Board of
Governors adopted a resolution that increased the
authorized capital stock of the IBRD by 331,500
shares; this represents an increase of approximately $40,000 million. The resolution provides
for a paid-in portion of 7.5 percent, compared with
the 10 percent paid-in portion of previously

approximately $4,000 million) and that authorized each member to subscribe to 250 shares of
this additional capital, none of which must be paid

The International Development Association
(IDA) held a total of $29,064 million in credits
on June 30, 1983, including $1,856 million
approved but not yet effective and $485 million
from exchange adjustments. Of the $27,208 million of effective credits, $9,839 million was
undisbursed at the end of the year.

Disbursements totaled $2,596 million in fiscal
1983, compared with $2,067 million last year. As
of June 30, 1983, IDA had disbursed a total of
$17,739 million since the start of its operations.

The total resources provided to IDA increased
$2,868 million in the period, primarily from subscriptions and contributions to the Sixth Replenishment, which aggregated $2,814 million. The
value of resources provided by members in prior
fiscal years decreased by $253 million, mostly the
result of currency depreciations, The IBRD
granted $125 million to IDA from its fiscal 1982
net income.

Other resources that became available toIDA
during the fiscal year totaled $182 million, and
were derived primarily from releases by Part II

1983 Regional Perspectives

Eastern Africa

The deterioration in economic conditions in
Eastern and Southern Africa, a condition that has
been detailed in recent Annual Reports of the
World Bank, continued during fiscal 1983.
Drought in many parts of the region depressed
farm output. International prices of those primary commodities that figure prominently in the
region’s exports feil precipitously. Adding to these
strains was the fall-off in amounts of official
development assistance (ODA). after increasing
fairly rapidiy for many years. net disbursements
of grants and concessional loans have leveled off.
Faced with a critical economic environment,
governments have intensified their search for
adjustment policies, including those relating to
energy production and conservation. In some
cases. they have taken remedial measures. often
with the assistance of the Bank and the Interna
 

tional Monetary Fund (IMF). [t is clear. nevertheless, that these policy initiatives have fallen
short of those required to deal effectively with the
magnitude of accumulated problems.

Deteriorating Economic Situation

Four countries experienced a marked decline
in total agricultural production in 1982. In Zimbabwe, food output—mainly maize—fell by 19
percent from the peak level of 1981. In Zambia,
too, the decline was from the previous year’s
bumper crop: in 1982, however, food crops were
less affected than other crops (such as tobacco and
cotton). which suffered a contraction of 11 percent. Although decreases in production in Madagascar and Ethiopia were not as steep. the
declines were not from the extraordinary high
levels of the previous year. In Ethiopia. the

decline was sectorwide: food. cash crops. and
livestock. In six other countries of the region, farm
output either stagnated (Burundi, Kenya, and
Rwanda) or increased at a rate that was less than
the rate of growth of the population (Malawi,
Tanzania. and Zaire).

By and large, the agricultural sector has continued to display the same adverse trends during
the early 1980s that characterized it throughout
the previous decade. Drought. which in 1982
particularly affected Botswana, Ethiopia,
Lesotho. Zambia. and Zimbabwe, was superimposed on an underlying weak situation of long
standing. For example, producer prices have not
kept pace with inflation in many countries.
thereby prolonging the downward trend in the
terms of trade of farmers that took place
throughout the 1970s. Marketing arrangements
have also tended to undermine incentives. In
addition, the acute scarcity of foreign exchange
has made it difficult for governments to ensure
sufficient supplies of imported fertilizer, pesticides, and spare parts. thereby reducing the
impact on production of such policy reforms as
have taken place.

The region's capacity to import was dealt a
severe blow by a sharp decline during 1982 in
world market prices of copper (15 percent), cotton (14 percent), sugar (49 percent), and tea (4
percent). The combined index of six major primary commodities of the region, accounting for
52 percent of its total exports. fell by 10 percent.

Lending to Borrowers in Eastern Africa, by Sector

(USS millions. Fiscal years.)

The foreign-exchange constraint was relieved, to
some extent, by a reduction in petroleum and food
prices but, on balance. the terms of trade of the
region continued to deteriorate significantly. The
index number of the commodity terms of trade
fell from 100 in 1978-80 to 81 in 1981, and to 75
in 1982. Terms of trade in 1982 were 36 percent
below the average of the entire decade of the
1970s. Some recovery is expected during the
period ahead, but it is very likely that, for the
whole of this decade, the terms of trade of the
Eastern and Southern African countries will
remain far worse than during the 1970s.
Another negative factor in the region’s balance of payments was the turnaround in the flows
of ODA. During the four-year period, 1977-80,
the value of grants and concessional medium-term
and long-term loans rose rapidiy—from $2.1 billion in 1977 to $4.7 billion in 1980. These external resources helped to offset. to some extent. the
impact of the external shocks sustained during the
1970s; they also financed a substantial share of
total public investment, as well as of total imports.
This strong upward trend in external aid was
interrupted in 1981: total ODA declined by 16
percent in current prices. Data for 1982 are not
yet available. Because the bulk of external capital flowing into the region consists of ODA, the
reverse flow of debt service has not been very
prominent in the aggregate balance-of-payments picture, except in a few countries. It is
worth noting, however, that there was a dou

Nore: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.bling of these payments in 1982, thereby reducing further the region’s capacity to import.

The balance-of-payments situation in the region
is a grim one. It is reflected in the increase in
arrears on external payments in several cases and
a widespread decline in official external reserves.
At the end of 1982, these reserves constituted less
than 10 percent of imports in ten countries, a
margin which is far below the critical minimum
required as a cushion to cope with the incidence
of fluctuations typical in the region. Most important, the crisis in the balance of payments is
reflected in an acute scarcity of imports. Last
year’s Annual Report noted the setback in capital accumulation; since then, many governments
have cut back further on public investment. A
scarcity of imported intermediate goods has
resulted in closings of factories, a deterioration
in road-transport systems, and a reduction in the
use of fertilizer and pesticides. In 1982, total
imports in current prices fell in Madagascar,
Malawi, Mauritius, Zaire, and Zambia.

Poor agricultural performance and tightening
balance-of-payments constraints, which adversely
affected import-dependent sectors, especially
industry, resulted in little gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Total real output (GDP) in
Madagascar declined for a second year in a row
and failed to recover fully in Tanzania and Zambia after sizable declines in 1981. In Ethiopia.
Kenya, Zaire, and Zimbabwe, output increased
at significantly slower rates than in 1981. Given
continued rapid increases in population, the result
has been a decline in per capita output in most
countries. The only exceptions are Somalia,
Sudan, and Uganda, where recoveries were from
previous years’ lows. For several countries, 1982
marked the third consecutive year in which per
capita output has declined.

Adjustment Efforts and the Energy Sector

During fiscal year 1983, many Eastern African
governments intensified their search for suitable
adjustment policies. Discussion on reforms has
begun in many countries, and, in some, measures aimed at managing aggregate demand,
making exchange rates more realistic. improving
agricultural incentives, and preparing publicinvestment programs have been undertaken.
Thus, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Uganda, Zaire,
Zambia, and Zimbabwe have begun actively to
reduce distortions in exchange rates. In Malawi,
Somalia, Sudan, and Uganda, producer prices
have risen markedly. In a number of other countries. governments have raised producer prices
in nominal terms; because these increases feil
short of the rate of inflation, however, farmers
failed to respond to the incentives. Uganda and
Sudan have accepted the discipline that is inher

ent in adopting multiyear public-investment

resources and whose project mix corresponds to
perceived priorities.

members can use IMF resources in case of need)
and Bank financial assistance. The Bank’s analytical work. particularly that which focuses on

years. Consultative Group meetings were held for
Sudan, Madagascar. and Mauritius during the past
year to help build a consensus among donors
around policy reforms adopted by those governments and to help mobilize financial resources
supplementary to those provided by the Fund and
the Bank.

The case of Uganda is instructive. As a result
of major policy initiatives begun in June 1981, the
government undertook to put into place a set of
measures affecting the exchange rate, interest
rates, farm prices. and taxes. These measures have
already caused coffee exports moving through
official channels to increase significantly and have
resulted in a large rise in the output of cotton,
textiles, cement. and sugar. The country’s GDP
increased in real terms in both 1981 and 1982 after
nine years of decline. The rate of inflation has
begun to subside. It is also clear that the impact
of these policy changes would have been far
greater had more external financial support been
available.

The case of Sudan is also of interest. An
important element in the Sudan crisis was the
protracted decline in cotton production. which
accounts for 50 percent of total exports. Measures affecting. among other things. the exchange
rate, taxes, and producer prices succeeded in
restoring incentives for cotton cultivation. An
IDA credit helped finance critical imported inputs
for the irrigated cotton subsector. The result was
a 35 percent increase in cotton production in 1981/
82. a year during which weather conditions were
also favorable. This outcome provides some hope
for the future and gives credence to the belief that
a turnaround in exports can be secured through
sustained efforts by the government and donors.
Early in calendar 1983. the Sudanese government designed a new policy package comprising
short-run stabtlization measures (such as fiscal
restraint), as well as a three-year public-investment program. The Consultative Group for Sudan
meeting in January 1983 recognized the interdependence of actions to be taken by aid donors.

region's member countries. These reports have

provided a good basis for discussion and meaningful policy action.

The emphasis of energy policy must be on
expanding local production. since the scope for
conservation is limited by low levels of present,
per capita consumption. The region has large
hydro, coal, and geothermal potential that awaits
exploitation. Potential also exists in the long run
for utilizing, economically, energy from the sun
and wind. There is room for considerable
improvement in the utilization of energy from
fuelwood. The charging of economic prices and
suitable taxation of petroleum products must
sharpen incentives for saving foreign exchange
and exploiting local resources.

The hydroelectric potential in the region is very
large. particularly in Ethiopia, Uganda, Zaire.
Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Only a small part of this
resource has been developed so far. Demand for
power is spread thinly over a vast geographical
area, while the underdeveloped hydro potential
is concentrated at a few sites. The cost of installing generating capacity can vary from $1.000 per
kW (1980 prices) for small units to $2.600 per kW
for large ones. The Bank has plaved a substantial
role in helping these countries to design least-cost
solutions to their power needs. to establish and
develop institutions in this sector, and to mobilize external finance for hydropower investments. In addition, financing has been provided
for coal-based power projects in Botswana and
Zimbabwe. These conventional projects constituted nearly 82 percent of total energy lending by
the Bank to Eastern Africa in fiscal 1983.

Importance of Fuelwood

While hydro and coal-based power is important, by far the most important source of energy
in the region is fuelwood. It accounts for over 90
percent of total energy production and consumption, except in a few countries of the region.
The fuelwood situation is a cause for concern.
Mounting demographic pressure and the widespread practice of consuming wood as a free good
without replanting it have precipitated a supply
crisis in some areas. Rural women and children
in many countries have had to devote a growing
amount of time to the gathering of wood. Degradation has occurred. especially around densely
settled areas, although the problem is not yet as
widespread as in many Asian countries, where
farmers are compelled to burn plant and animal
wastes. If current trends continue. however.
environmental damage will accumulate and cause
serious injury. To counter these trends. the Bank
has helped finance two purely industrial plantation projects in Kenya. More recently, the Bank
has followed up with a third scheme, which
includes a major rural afforestation component
aimed at expanding seedling production from 13million in 1981 to 53 million in 1986. In Malawi,
the Bank assisted the first project exclusively
geared to solving the fuelwood problem. It consists of a pilot program for a national network of
seedling distribution; in the much larger second
phase, the emphasis will be on integrating forestry with other aspects of overall farm management. A similar project for Zimbabwe was
approved in fiscal 1983. Most other countries need
to consider similar approaches; to balance
demand for fuelwood with sustainable supply,
planting levels have to increase fifteenfold by the
year 2000.

To some extent, demand for fuelwood can be
restrained by improving the efficiency of its use.
In Burundi, Kenya, Malawi, and Rwanda, the
Bank is participating in attempts to improve the
efficiency of wood and charcoal burners and to
introduce improved cooking stoves. If it were not
for sociocultural and other impediments to their
adoption, improved woodstoves, costing from $5
to $10 each, could achieve savings in energy of
up to 50 percent. Conservation in industrial
processes is improving: for example, in Malawi,
attempts are being made to improve furnaces,
burners, and flue designs in the tobacco industry
with a view to reducing consumption of fuelwood by SQ) percent. These examples need replication.

Another recent thrust of Bank lending in
Eastern Africa is for exploration and development of indigenous energy sources. In fiscal 1983.
finance was extended for coal engineering in
Zambia and Tanzania. as well as petroleum
exploration in Ethiopia and Madagascar. Activities financed by the Bank in gas exploration in
the Songo Songo field area in Tanzania have
resulted in gas finds to date that have far exceeded
earlier expectations (about 500 billion cubic feet).
Proven reserves are now established, which are
the equivalent of sixty-five years to seventy-five
years of electricity consumption at existing levels. In Kenya. two Bank-assisted geothermal
projects, totaling 30 mW, supplied 10 percent of
the country’s electricity consumption in fiscal
1983. Kenya is considering further investments
of this kind.

Eastern Africa’s potential in other renewable
resources—biomass, solar, wind, small hydro—
holds out promise in the long term that the needs
for small-scale decentralized power sources for
agricultural and rural development can be met.

Eastern Africa 6?

The Bank is encouraging solar research in Zimbabwe and Mauritius; and. in Burundi, the use
of peat.

Possibilities for conservation of imported
energy, and therefore for saving foreign exchange,
are also being explored within the transport sector, which, on the average. absorbs about half the
oil imports in Eastern African countries, This
burden of imports is particularly acute for the
landlocked countries, which had to pay landed
costs averaging $100 per barrel of oil in 1982.
Overall. most countries seem to be moving toward
a more efficient use of energy by improving
maintenance procedures for roads and vehicles
and by acquiring light, energy-efficient vehicles.
Possibilities for saving fuel are also being tapped
in the industrial sector; for example, the substitution of coal for petroieum in the Bamburi
cement factory in Kenya will reduce fuel costs by
at least 25 percent. In Zaire, the change-over from
using oil-fired boilers for heating and producing
process steam to electric boilers means that idle
hydropower capacity there will be put to use.
Programs for reducing losses in electric-power
systems through the rehabilitation of transmission and distribution networks also form part of
this effort.

In general, Eastern African countries have
reacted to the increase in petroleum prices during the period 1974-81 by passing them on to the
consumer. However, distortions exist, anda
common one has been subsidized diesel fuel and
kerosene. To determine the cost of supply and to
design a structure for tariff rates, the Bank has
financed many tariff studies. Based partly on these
analyses, power tariffs in 1982 rose by 50 percent
in Tanzania, 20 percent in Swaziland. and 8.5
percent in Malawi. An increase of about 85 percent took place in Sudan in mid-1983.

These policy initiatives in the energy field are
encouraging. In this sector. as in others reviewed
earlier in this chapter, the policy-reform process
has just begun. Implementation has been slow,
uneven, and far short of what is required. Much
remains to be done in agriculture and public
finance, as well as in industrial and trade policy,
parastatal efficiency, and resource mobilization.
The Bank has supported policy reform through
increased technical and financial assistance; in
fiscal 1983, IBRD and [DA commitments were
at record levels in terms of both amounts and the
number of projects approved.70 1983 Regional Perscectives

Western Africa

During fiscal year 1983, Western Africa continued to suffer from depressed markets for
commodities, high interest rates, and stagnating
ievels of official development assistance. While
by no means the only cause of poor growth of the
Western African economies, the worldwide
recession, now in its fourth year, has been a
dominant factor since 1979, in contrast with the
1960s and 1970s. when country structural problems and inadequate policies were the principal
reasons why growth was slow in the region.!

Estimates of cumulative growth of gross
domestic product (GDP) over the three years,
1980-82. show that average per capita incomes
have increased in two countries only: Cameroon
(by 26 percent) and Congo (by 40 percent). In
three countries (Ivory Coast. Togo, Sierra Leone).
GDP grew at rates slightly less than the population. In nearly all the other eighteen countries of
the region—including Nigeria (although growth
there was very fast in the period 1974-79)—there

was a net decline in overall per capita incomes.
There is no indication that there will be much
relief to this bleak picture in 1983. If indications
of economic recovery in the major industrial
countries are confirmed, the impact on African
exports is unlikely to be felt before 1984—even
though some commodity prices (coffee, cocoa)
began a modest recovery during the first half of
1983.

Because of the sharp decrease in foreignexchange earnings, countries of the region have
experienced persistent and often widening trade
deficits on current account—with Cameroon and
Gabon the only notable exceptions. As a pro

averageportion of gross national product (GNP), current-account deficits for most countries now
exceed 10 percent; in some cases, the deficit is
several times that level. External reserves have
fallen to their lowest level ever. In two-thirds of
the countries of the region, they amounted to less
than one month’s imports at the end of 1982. They
are even negative for countries that make up the
West African Monetary Union (UMOA)*—particularly Ivory Coast and Senegal—although
foreign exchange for high-priority uses in these
two countries, as in other members of the franc

iscal constraint has also become extremely
severe--with the exception of Cameroon and
Gabon. That constraint is manifested in several
ways. Cuts in expenditure, first of all. have
affected public-investment programs. It is probable that current investment levels allow for net
capital formation in only a handful of the countries in the region. It is also probable that in more
than half of the countries, lack of maintenance is
resulting in a real erosion of capital stock. Thus,
the continuing crisis is not only reducing the level
of activity, it is also jeopardizing future growth.
Current public operations are similarly affected,
albeit less drastically. Because both foreign
exchange and domestic revenues are scarce,
shortages of fuel and other imported inputs are
widespread. Insufficient local financing has
slowed down the implementation of ongoing
projects; and in perhaps a half dozen countries,
delays of several weeks in meeting the payrolls
of the civil service have become the rule rather
than the exception.

One of the potentially most damaging effects
of the crisis is that its persistence and severity
make it difficult for governments to carry out
structural-adjustment policies needed to foster
long-term growth. Restructuring investment
programs that are out of phase with sectoral
developments; reducing input subsidies, let alone
increasing producer prices. in the face of falling
export prices; removing food subsidies when
consumers’ real incomes are declining; recapitalizing public enterprises when public budgets
cannot meet the wage bill; reducing government
employment at a time of high urban unemployment—these are some of the challenges that
governments in Senegal and Ivory Coast. Mali and
Niger, Togo and Benin, Liberia and Guinea. and

 

 

Western Africa “7A

others face. Against such odds, not surprisingly,
progress over the last two or three years in
implementing reforms has been uneven.

To make things worse, agricultural production in 1982 was severely affected by unusually
poor rainfall in parts of the Sahel (Mali, Upper
Volta) and in the coastal countries, particularly
Benin, Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Togo. The
drought, in several countries, also led to severe
crop losses through fires. In Ivory Coast, drought
and the harmattan combined to produce fire
conditions considered to be the worst in living
memory, with even the high forests burning out
of control in some instances. Ten percent of the
stock planted in teak in a i979 Bank- ted
project was totally destroyed. Fire also damaged
cocoa and coffee plantations in Ghana. Ivory
Coast, and Togo.

 

Oil Exporters, Traditional and New
The situation in Nigeria—the largest economy
in sub-Saharan Africa—indicates the gravity of
the crisis. Foreign-exchange earnings. virtually
all from oil exports. have fallen dramatically since
the end of 1981, Foreign-exchange reserves
declined in 1982 from a level equivalent to three
months’ worth of imports to less than three weeks’
worth. Investment, equal to about a third of GDP
in 1980-81, has been radically reduced, as both
foreign exchange and government resources

both federal and state, are directly generated from
oil exports). Imports in 1983 are likely to be
reduced to about half their 1981 level. GDP that
is not accounted for by oil declined about 4 percentin 1982, and was declining at an even higher
rate in the first half of 1983. This decline has also
reduced incomes in Togo and Benin because of
their dependence on exports to Nigeria. particularly of food and of commodities in transit. As
early as April 1982, the government took a number of emergency measures involving import
restrictions and fiscal contraction. The measures
have proven insufficient—as the price of oil and
the volume of oil exports continued their downfiscal and external bal

however, is low; the country. therefore, is likely
to borrow heavily in 1983, possibly through some
combination of medium-term refinancing from
foreign banks of part of the arrears on trade payments. through borrowings from other countries
that are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). and through
additional Eurodollar borrowing.

The downturn has brought investment programs in Nigeria’s states to a virtual standstill.
Since many projects involving IBRD assistance
have shortages of counterpart funding. the pace
of project implementation has slowed considerably. The Bank is taking steps to speed up disbursements and to cover a greater proportion of
project costs. In addition. a loan of about $250
million to finance the cost of fertilizer imports was
at an advanced stage of preparation as fiscal 1983
ended.

By contrast. income in the Congo grew rapidly
in 1982. In 1982, investment expenditure was at
a level six times higher than the average of the
previous five years, a reflection of greatly
increased petroleum exports and increased borrowing under a very ambitious five-year plan.
However. since the beginning of 1983. the government has undertaken to make deep cuts in the
program as official reestimates. made in early
1983, showed that oil revenues for the year may
be 40 percent lower than had been originally
forecast.

 

 

 

Lending to Borrowers in Western Africa, by Sector

(USS millions. Fiscal years.)

The region’s newest oil exporter, Cameroon,
continued to grow rapidly. with GDP probably
increasing by more than 7 percent in 1982.
Twenty-five years ago. Cameroon was a lowincome country overwhelmingly dependent on
coffee and cocoa as sources of forcign-exchange
earnings. Now, with one of the highest incomes
in the region ($880 per capita in 1981). more
diversified exports, and increased creditworthiness. Cameroon has graduated as a borrower from
IDA to become eligible for IBRD borrowing.
Cameroon's government perceives the mediumterm problem as one of the opportunities and
perils that accompany large oil exports. The government has had a measure of success in avoiding the all-too-frequent consequences of a
booming oil sector. which produces abundant
foreign exchange and fiscal resources: atrophy of
other commodity-producing activities, particularly agriculture, as food imports become easily
available and agricultural exports less critical.

Energy Problems in the Region

The problem of energy supply in Western
Africa is primarily that of fuelwood, which. in
most countries, accounts for more than 80 percent of all energy consumption. The depletion of
forest capital is most pronounced in the Sahelian
countries. but even in the coastal states further
south, local imbalances between supply and
demand create similar problems on an increasing scale.

Current wood consumption in the Sahelian
countries is approximately one kilogram of dry
wood per person daily and far exceeds the capacity of local forest resources. If wood-consumption practices continue unchanged. only 65
percent of domestic energy needs will come from
natural forests and managed tree plantations by
the year 2000. Most countries will have to halve
their fuelwood consumption by the turn of the
century if there are to be any forests left. Reduction in wood consumption can be achieved
through more efficient usage and substitution of
other energy sources, but considerable deforestation also takes place because of land being
brought into cultivation and because of overgrazing. A recent study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN estimates that the
areas affected add up to a million hectares each
year in the Sahelian countries. Consequently. in
order to avoid irreversible damage to the environment, agropastoral programs are needed in
addition to those designed to deal with the fuelwood scarcity,

[t is becoming apparent that afforestation is
only a partial solution to the fuelwood-supply
problem. A more comprehensive approach to
energy supply in rural regions is necessary. specifically to examine how commercial energy could
become a substitute for fuelwood (by appropri
 

 

ate policies on pricing, supply, changing traditions, and introduction of efficient appliances).
Commercialized energy supply to the modern
sectors of the national economies in Western
Africa is hampered by the lack of basic infrastructure. Hfence, much Bank activity ts being
directed toward improved knowledge of energy
resources. Petroleum-sector assistance is being
provided to nine countries to promote exploration and. eventually, exploitation of indigenous
resources. Inventories of hydroclectric-power
resources are being made under IDA technicalassistance credits to Benin and Togo and under
an IBRD-administered UNDP grant to Guinea.
Because the major hydro resources of the region
are concentrated in a few countries, the preparation for their development will be facilitated by
regional cooperation in joint studies of water
resources and electrical interconnections. The
Bank supports, therefore, the organizations
established for such a purpose by the countries
of the region, such as the Niger Basin Authority.
Another problem in meeting the energy
requirements of the modern sector in Western
Africa is that of institutional weakness, the root
cause of which is a shortage of trained manpower. In Bank technical-assistance projects.
increasing attention is being paid to manpowertraining needs in those energy-sector entities that74 1983 Regional Perspectives

 

have difficulty coping with the demands imposed
by economic growth. In addition. there is
increasing concentration on the relationships
between governments and parastatal enterprises. as well as to their rehabilitation.

Three Restructuring Efforts

In Ivory Coast. structural-adjustment policies
continued to be pursued with determination. The
IBRD’s first structural-adjustment loan (of $150
million} in support of the government's initiation of a stabilization plan was fully disbursed carly
in 1983. As a result of the continuing adverse
external environment. further declines in the
country’s terms of trade were registered: GDP
declined in real terms by 1.8 percent in 1982. The
government's response was to move swiftly to
strengthen and intensify its structural-adjustment program. It adopted a bold and forceful
package of policy reforms designed to promote
growth. improve productivity, and generate
public savings. Measures include reforms in
investment programming. in public enterprises,
and in agricultural incentives. New features of
adjustment include a major restructuring of the
system of industrial incentives and protection and
reform of the costly public-housing scheme. In
support of this program. a second IBRD joan (for
$281 million) was negotiated at the end of fiscal
1983.

The Togolese government, with support from
the IMF. has designed a program that concentrates on reform of public enterprises. agricultural pricing. and macroeconomic management,
with emphasis on reducing the government deficit. IDA has supported this program through a
structural-adjustment credit of $40 million. In
neighboring Benin. the government introduced
a new five-year plan and presented a package of
policy reforms. notably in agriculture and the
public-enterprise sector. ata Round Table meeting of aid donors and private investors organized
jointly with the United Nations Development
Programme in March 1983.

 

 

 

Adjusting to Reduced Prospects

Nowhere in the region has the crisis been more
acute. or indeed more chronic. than in Ghana. For
the past decade. exports. imports. investment.
and production have all been in decline. In the
period 1976-1982. Ghana's consumer price index
increased by more than thirty-twofold. In 1982,
however. the new government took immediate
measures to reduce expenditures and domestic
credit so as to contain inflation and restore cocoa
exports by rehabilitating roads and raising producer prices. In 1983. several further basic
adjustments were undertaken. They included a
de facto devaluation of the cedi. rehabilitation and
investment in agriculture. further budgetary

 

austerity, and reduced growth of the money supply. To implement the program. Ghana sought
the help of both bilateral and multilateral donors.
The IMF agreed to a stand-by agreement equivalent to 150 percent of Ghana's quota and a compensatory drawing to cover 1982's shortfall in
exports. IDA provided a fast-disbursing import
credit during the year and agreed to accelerate
preparatory work on an export-rehabilitation
credit in fiscal 1984. The unexpected arrival in
February 1983 of hundreds of thousands of
Ghanaians from Nigeria put further pressure on
Ghana's resources—particularly food supplies,
which were already low as a result of a poor harvest in 1982. The response of the aid community
to this untimely event provided a measure of
relief.

After years of destruction and economic deterioration wrought by civil conflict. Chad began
reconstruction in fiscal 1983 with an acute shortage of spare parts, production inputs, machinery, equipment, and imported goods. The Bank
is working with the government and other donors
in preparing a reconstruction program that could
be supported with an IDA credit.

The three neighboring countries of Guinea,
Sierra Leone, and Liberia all suffered further
decreases in their terms of trade in fiscal [983 and
recorded either stagnation or further declines in
their per capita incomes. Through various policy
changes, the governments of all three countries
have attempted to adjust to their reduced prospects. In Guinea. the government alleviated, to
some extent, the extreme shortage of foreign
exchange by Jegalizing imports that are financed
through the parallel market tor foreign exchange.
This measure followed that which legalized the
private marketing of locally produced food at
market-determined prices. Agricultural exports
at the official exchange rate. however. continue
to be very limited—less than 5 percent of the level
of two decades ago.

In Liberia, the government has successfully
adopted a number of extremely difficult measures. Following the elimination, in fiscal 1982. of
the consumer rice subsidy. public-sector salaries
were reduced in January 1983 by between 16
percent and 25 percent. In addition. a development strategy—aimed at increasing food production, exports. and employment—was
enunciated that emphasized rural development
in general, and smaliholder agriculture in particular. The government has also undertaken to
improve the operations of public enterprises. in
part so as to avoid using scarce government revenues to cover their operating deficits: plans even
exist to sell some of the public corporations to
private buyers. To support efforts at rehabilitating public corporations. the government is
working with the Bank to develop a technical-Western Africa 75

 

 

ance project to such enterprises. The credit
proposal is expected to be readied before the end
of calendar 1983.

In Sierra Leone, total output has declined in
the last two years, as have the prices of its major
exports—diamonds, coffee, and cocoa. Asa
result, the deficit on current account of the balance of payments increased to 10 percent of GDP
by fiscal 1982. To move toward a position of
exchange equilibrium, the government introduced, with IMF support, a dual exchange rate
as a first step in the full devaluation of the leone.
And effective January 1983, producer prices for
coffee and cocoa were increased by between 8
percent and SO percent. The government has also
introduced measures to contain public expenditures and increase domestic revenues.

 

Examples from the Sahel

Since exports account for a third of GDP. Senegal is highly vulnerable to changes in its terms
of trade. For example, when. in late 1982. the
world prices of groundnut products—which normally account for about a quarter of export revenues—fell to their lowest level, in real terms,
since the 1930s, the country’s overall terms of
trade fell 10 percent. Foreign-exchange earnings
were so reduced that scheduled debt-service
payments would have risen from around 14 percent of export receipts in 1981/82 to 33 percent in
1982/83 had not a second round of debt rescheduling taken place following agreement with the
IMF on a stand-by arrangement. Balance-ofpayments support was also provided by France,
Iraq. Kuwait, Oman, and Saudi Arabia. For its
part, the government has made a number of difficult adjustments. To bring about a measure of
fiscal balance. consumer subsidies on cooking oil,
wheat flour, sugar, and, above all, rice have been
decreased; the price of rice was raised, successfully, by 31 percent. Reform of public enterprises is continuing (to eliminate deficits. a
number of public firms recently increased their
tariffs). The International Development Association is assisting the country’s reform program
through an ongoing technical-assistance project.
which was approved in fiscal year 1981.

Among the other Sahelian countries, Mali is
perhaps most advanced in carrying through economic reforms. Even though GDP grew about 4
percentin (982. largely as a consequence of a good
harvest. it was not enough to compensate for the
slow erosion in living standards that had taken
place throughout the 1970s—a decade during
which large external and fiscal imbalances had
emerged. To deal with the situation. the government undertook, during the past year, sweeping
policy changes, many of which were written into
the new Development Plan (1981-1985) and
presented at a UNDP-sponsored Round Table

 

 

  

meeting in December 1982. Higher prices for
petroleum products and basic consumer imports
have been introduced, producer prices for locally
produced cereals have been substantially
increased, and retail sales have gradually been
liberalized. State enterprises—they account for
most production in the modern sector—are being
restructured, in part through increases in tariffs
and through closure of the least efficient units, The
civil-service wage structure and recruitment policies are being rationalized. To support these
efforts, the government is making use of a wide
range of bilateral and multilateral technical
assistance, including an IDA credit extended in
November 1982. What has evolved is a carefully
developed plan of economic adjustment reflecting the government's basic and persistent commitment to change.

In Niger. a financial-rehabilitation program was
introduced in 1982 in order to cope with the effects
of reduced revenues resulting from two factors:
low prices and unanticipated lower production of
uranium; and second, greatly increased debtservice payments arising from excessive commercial borrowing contracted for an overambitious investment program prepared during the
years of rising uranium revenues. In addition to
expanding its program of regular projects, IDA
is also preparing. with the government, a technical-assistance credit designed to strengthen the
country’s capacity for macroeconomic analysis
and debt management.

 

 

Assistance to the Region

As noted in previous Annual Reports, improved
conditions in the Western Africa region can result
in the short term and medium term only from a
combination of expanding export markets in the
industrialized countries. gradual increases, in real
terms, in the level of official development assistance, a resumption of private capital flows
towards the more creditworthy countries. and
sustained efforts by governments to introduce
necessary institutional and policy reforms. By the
end of fiscal year 1983, most countries in the
region had undertaken to implement many of the
necessary changes: but results in the form of
improved overall economic performance are
likely to be limited if the world economic environment does not also become more favorable.

To assist Western African countries through the
current difficult period. IDA committed $428
million during the past year, or 83 percent more
than in fiscal 1982, and 12 percent more than the
previous highest level (fiscal 1981) despite severe
constraints on the Association's resources. This
volume of lending is in line with lending objectives of maintaining sub-Saharan Africa’s share
of total IDA allocations for the period fiscal 198286 at 30 percent at the least. Because of project-76 1983 Regional Perspectives

implementation difficulties in Nigeria, however,
the level of IBRD commitments to the region fell
to $237 million, a little over a fourth of the extraordinary amount committed in the previous year
($854 million), when there was an unusual conjunction of six projects for Ivory Coast, including one for energy ($101.5 million) and one for
structural adjustment ($150 million).

Atthe same time, the policy dialogue between
the Bank and most of the countries in the region
continued to broaden and gain in depth. Increasing awareness on both sides that appropriate
sectoral policies are essential elements of project
success has led to much closer attention being
given in sector work and lending operations to
pricing as well as to institutional aspects, including the reorganization of public enterprises
directly or indirectly involved in project execution. These considerations obviously apply in

structural-adjustment lending. but also in traditional sectors such as agriculture, industry.
transport, public utilities, and urban development, as wel] as in areas of more recent Bank
involvement, such as health care. Concern with
greater efficiency in the use of scarce resources,
including existing physical assets. has led also to
renewed emphasis on maintenance, rehabilitation, and training. Funding for such components, as well as provision for adequate costrecovery systems, have become a frequent feature of Bank-assisted projects in the region.

The Bank has also greatly expanded financing
for technical-assistance projects—which cut across
sectors and, generally, include important training components—to strengthen governments’
capability for policy analysis of macroeconomic,
as well as sectoral issues, and which assist thereby
in the design of policy-reform packages.East Asia and Pacific

The developing countries of the East Asia and
Pacific region—with the exception of China—
have experienced the full force of the world
recession. Their economic prospects have been
dominated by the poor performance of the world
economy, and their economic policies have been
preoccupied with the search for appropriate
means to deal with the changing economic situation. After a decade of high growth. accompanied by moderately high inflation, low and often
negative real interest rates, and a plentiful supply of private capital from the international
banking system, fiscal 1983 was characterized by
low growth, falling inflation, high and positive real
interest rates. and a reduction in the flow of
overseas capital. The reduction was, in part, due
to some hesitancy on the part of the world banking system to extend further credit to countries
perceived ta have relatively large debt burdens.

The world recession has had varied effects on
the countries of the region. The largest country

East Asia and Pacific 77

in the region, China, continues to grow, despite
the recession, while making internal adjustments in its economic system. Two major net oilexporting countries, Indonesia and Malaysia,
have had to adjust to lower world oil prices and
weaker demand. Both face substantial internal
adjustments at both the macro and the micro
levels. Another group of countries affected by the
recession consists of the three newly industrializing countries, the Republic of Korea, Thaijand, and the Philippines. These three countries
were already under pressure from the oil-price
increases of 1979-80 and from the high (and variable) interest rates of 1980-81, While interest
rates began to come down in mid-1982. oil prices
remained high until 1983, Other aspects of the
world recession, such as falling commodity prices,
declining export markets, and rising protectionism have hit these countries hard. All three have
programs of structural adjustment, which are
being supported by IBRD loans. The remaining

countries of the region include the poor countries of Laos and Viet Nam, and the island countries of the Pacific—Papua New Guinea, Fiji,
Western Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. These island nations, particularly. have suffered from the steep decline in commodity prices
and the other aspects of recession.

The Newly Industrializing Nations

The impact of the sharply deteriorating external environment in 1982 is perhaps most clearly
illustrated in the case of the Philippines. Its real
rate of growth, as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP), slowed to 2.5 percent in 1982,
about a third of the rate achieved in 1978-79, with
the main decline being experienced in the rate of
industrial growth. Both investment and exports
fell sharply. The country’s real income was
reduced by further adverse movements in the
terms of trade, which worsened by about 25 percent during the period 1979-82; the deterioration in 1982. alone. was 8 percent.

These developments can be traced to the poor
market situation for the country’s principal export
products—copper. coconut products, sugar, and
forest products. Although nontraditional manufactured exports—electronics. garments. and
leather and sporting goods. for example—grew
by 2 percent in 1982 in the face of increasing protectionism in export markets. this growth was not
enough to offset the decline in traditional exports.
The fall in the value of total exports in 1982 was

larger than the decline in imports, and the current-account balance-of-payments deficit widened to $3.4 billion. While GDP growth is unlikely
to be much higher in 1983 than in 1982, some
improvement in the balance-of-payments situation is expected: Lower prices for imported fuel
and declining interest rates on the large external
debt will reduce the burden of external payments.

There is a double impact upon the Philippines
from the world recession. There is the direct
impact on incomes and employment. But there
is also the effect on public revenues and resource
mobilization, making it more difficult for the
country to carry out its development programs.
Despite the difficulties, the Philippines has
embarked on a program of needed structural
changes. The program includes measures of
energy conservation and self-sufficiency. industrial restructuring, poverty alleviation, and
human-resource development. All have been
hampered by the inadequacy of domestic
resources to match the available external capital. Loans from the IBRD are assisting with the
structural-adjustment measures, and project
lending is aimed at other long-run development
needs,

While facing equally difficult world conditions, the economy of the Republic of Korea grew
by 5.4 percent during 1982, and there were signs
that some of the structural imbalances that had
emerged during the period of rapid growth in the

second half of the 1970s were gradually being
removed. Further, the dislocation caused in 197980 by the second oil shock and political uncertainty seems far less evident today. Inflation.
which averaged 25 percent over the two-year
period, 1980-81, fell to less than 5 percent in 1982.
Investment. which had stagnated for almost three
years, began to recover, and recovery was
accompanied by a dip in the unemployment rate.
Export growth was encouraging; there was a rise
of 1.5 percent in the value of exports and by more
than four times that amount in volume. Meanwhile, imports declined by 4.0 percent in value
terms, mainly because of a fall in the prices of fuel
and raw materials. This decline in imports, combined with a buoyant expansion of invisible
exports (income from construction firms and
workers’ remittances). led to a reduction in the
current-account deficit by almost half—from $4.4
billion in [981 to around $2.5 billion in 1982. The
shrinking balance-of-payments deficit. which in
part reflects the slower growth in gross national
product (GNP), is also an indication of a revival
of domestic savings, which had dropped quite
sharply in the recession of 1980-81 from its peak
of 26 percent in 1979. Despite the small deficit in

 

the balance of payments, the steady accumulation of foreign debt borrowed at high and variable rates of interest led to a small increase in the
debt-service ratio (which includes short-term
debt) from 20,7 percent in 1981 to 21 percent in
1982.

Korea’s performance in 1982 was stronger than
most other countries in the region and was
appreciably superior to that of other nonoilexporting developing countries around the world.
Its ability to increase exports, if only by a small
margin, was undoubtedly a factor in economic
expansion, but a good harvest and the government’s counter-cyclical policy of encouraging
construction, together added close to 4 points to
the growth rate. The sharp decline in inflation was
closely related to the stabilization of oil and rawmaterial prices, but these, in turn, were reinforced by the conservative monetary policy followed in 198] and through the first half of 1982.
Supplementing monetary actions was an informal, but nonetheless effective, wages policy.

Encouraged by the economic achievements of
1982, Korean planners project a growth in GNP
of 7.5 percent for 1983. a current-account deficit
of 2.7 percent of GNP. and an inflation rate of no80 4983 Regionai Perspectives

more than 4 percent. However, economic
expansion and a current-account deficit in the
balance-of-payments anticipated to be in the
amount of $2 billion will depend, to a considerable extent, upon an increase in the volume of
exports of just under 10 percent, some improvement in the terms of trade. and on a growth in
imports of no more than 9 percent. While this is
certainly within the realm of possibility, continuing economic sluggishness of Korea’s major
trading partners among the industria! countries
would make the export target a difficult one to
achieve; growth, therefore, may have to be sustained by domestic demand—as it has been for
the past year. As a consequence. the balance-ofpayments deficit could be somewhat larger than
is currently projected.

Thailand has also been adjusting to the adverse
world conditions. By international comparison,
its GDP growth—at about 4 percent—was above
average in 1982. but the economy suffered a sharp
deterioration in its external terms of trade. Inflation was greatly reduced. and consumer prices
increased by only 5 percent during the year. Low
investmentand destocking of inventories resulted
in substantially lower imports. while exports, on
the other hand. continued to grow—albeit at a
pace slower than in previous vears. This confluence of events resulted in a current-account deficit in the balance of payments that was lower than
in recent years. falling to 3 percent of GDP in
1982. down from 7 percent the year before. Thus,
with continued. though reduced. growth in GDP.
lower inflation. and a significant reduction in the
current-account deficit. Thailand weathered the
international recession of 1982 quite well. except
for a considerable deterioration in public-sector
savings. The budget deficit in 1982 was about 4
percent of GDP. or roughly twice the amount
budgeted. and was largely the result of shortfalls
in revenue. These shortfalls were the result of
lower inflation. less domestic activity, and fewer
imports.

Since 1980, government policy in Thailand has
emphasized those programs and policies that aim
at adjusting the economy to a sustainable mediumterm balance-of-payments position. while maintaining the impetus of growth. Both the programs and reforms under way. coordinated in a
structural-adjustment program supported by the
Bank. are attempting to integrate the longer-term
concerns of socioeconomic development and
equity with improved medium-term external and
internal financial stability.

The program concentrates on five major policv areas,

labor intensive, and export oriented.

e In the energy sector, further steps are being
taken to promote conservation, adjust prices, and
develop indigenous energy resources.

@ In the fiscal area, both short-term and longerterm reforms are planned to reduce the extent to
which public deficits have contributed to the balance-of-payments problem and to make more
efficient the allocation of public resources.

e Finally, all these elements of the structuraladjustment program depend on effective institutional development, to be pursued through
improved planning. budgeting, and management in the public sector and the creation of
additional analytical capability in the government.

The Oil-exporting Countries

The region includes two oil-exporting developing countries, Indonesia and Malaysia. Both
have been hard hit by the recession and both have
been forced to revise their development prospects in the face of lower receipts from exports.

The prolonged world recession has caused a
sharp reversal in Indonesia's current-account
balance. In both fiscal 1980 and 1981, the country enjoyed a current-account surplus in excess
of $2 billion, with oil and liquid natural gas
accounting for about two-thirds of export earnings. Only two years ago, the outlook was for
continuing, large surpluses throughout the early
part of the 1980s, and medium-term development plans were drawn up based upon that
expectation. But in fiscal 1982. the volume of oil
exports fell, world demand for other export
commodities, such as rubber, timber. tin, and
coffee. softened, and Indonesia’s nonoil terms of
trade deteriorated substantially—by about 25
percent from their level of 1979. As the world
recession intensified and oil prices weakened. the
current-account deficit of $2.8 billion (in fiscal
1982) increased to almost $7 billion in fiscal 1983.
equivalent to approximately & percent of GNP for
that year.

Domestic production has also been affected,
Following an average annual growth in GDP of
8 percent between 1970 and 1981. growth in 1982
is estimated to have been no more than half that
average, largely as a consequence of lower export
receipts.

The policies implemented by Indonesia in
recent years have helped to case the impact of the
worsened external-resources position. Part of the
increased oil revenues in 1979 and 1980 were used
to accumulate substantial international reserves.
and the country’s external debt has been prudently managed; thus, at the beginning of fiscal
1983. Indonesia had a healthy cushion of foreign-exchange reserves and the capacity to raisesignificant quantities of external finance. The
structure of production is also well diversified,
relative to many oil exporters, and agriculture,
in particular, has performed well in recent years;
Indonesia has moved from being the world’s
largest rice importer towards self-sufficiency.
However, the extent of the decrease in oil-sector
receipts has underlined the need for significant
changes in domestic policy.

During 1982 and 1983, the government acted
swiftly to this loss in export income resulting from
the world economic recession. Subsidies on
domestic sales for fuels, fertilizer, and certain food
items have been reduced, or altogether eliminated, with the prices of subsidized domestic fuels
having been raised by between 60 percent and 70
percent in both 1982 and 1983. An austere budget has been introduced for fiscal 1984; there was
a 28 percent devaluation of the rupiah in March
1983; and a significant rephasing of planned largescale, import-intensive industrial investments was
announced in May 1983. In addition, in June 1983,
the government introduced a major reform in
financial policy aimed at the mobilization of private savings and greater efficiency in the allocation of credit by state banks. This package of
measures represents a major reorientation in
policy that should effectively support the transition to a sustainable external account. In the
course of the transition period, however, there
will be a need to maintain the level of external
borrowing of recent years to finance the currentaccount deficit.

The experience of Malaysia has been similar to
that of Indonesia. Although less dependent upon
oil exports, it has been extremely hard hit by the
fail in the world prices of tin and rubber, two of
its principal commodity exports. As prices of
imports did not lessen, the terms of trade worsened by 20 percent in the period, calendar 198082. after rising by 40 percent during the previous
five years. With worsening terms of trade, the
balance-of-payments position has changed dramatically. From a situation of current-account
surpluses, there has been a shift to deficits,
amounting to 10 percent of GNP in 1981 and 13
percent in 1982.

Until the second half of 1982, the government
continued to maintain high expenditures relative
to income, acting in a counter-cyclical fashion. Tax
revenues, reduced by export taxes on commodities that fell in price, were not sufficiently buoyant to prevent large deficits from emerging—up
to as much as 20 percent of GNP in 1981-82, Much
of these deficits was financed externally; in fact,
Malaysia’s relatively low debt burden of the late
1970s permitted an expansion of debt obligations and a rise in debt service.

Adjustment to the impact of recession is now
under way, it began with reductions in the 1982

budget and was followed by budget cuts in 1983.
The country’s short-term stabilization effort is to
be accompanied by efforts to come to grips with
the longer-term structural issues that are now
emerging, issues that are reflected in a slowdown
in the rate of growth of the economy, which fell
to 4 percent in 1982. Foremost is the need to
revitalize agriculture: The output of several major
crops has declined for the last few years. Secondly, there is a need in the manufacturing sector to discover new sources of growth in the face
of weaker internal demand and a heavy concentration in manufactured exports on a small number of commodities. There are also problems
arising from shortages of skilled and unskilled
labor.

China: The Least Affected

China’s experience during the past year has
differed markedly from the other countries of the
region. Since 1979, Chinese economic policy has
had two main objectives: to adjust the structure
of production and expenditure in such a way as
to raise the share of consumption in national
income and to reform the system of economic
management so as to increase the efficiency of
production and investment. Though neither
objective has proved easy to attain, this strategy,
on balance, has had rather good results.

Agriculture has done particularly well. Systemic changes, which enhanced incentives and
producer discretion, in conjunction with higher
procurement prices for agricultural products and
fairly good weather, caused gross output in the
five-year period, 1978-82, to grow at an annual
average real rate of 7 percent. Real income per
farmer (which increased very little in 1958-1977)
has risen even faster during the past five years—
at an annual average per capita rate of over 10
percent. Since the rural population makes up fourfifths of the total, this growth in income has contributed substantially to raising the average
standard of living.

Industrial output, in aggregate, has grown
somewhat more slowly in the past five years than
in the preceding twenty. But light industry—
mainly producing consumer goods—has grown
rapidly (at an annual average real rate of 12 percent). There has also been increased emphasis—
partly through administrative regulation, but also
through systemic innovations such as profit
retention and greater enterprise autonomy in
production and marketing—on reducing wastage of energy, raw materials, and capital. and on
improving the quality of output. Progress in these
respects, however, has been limited by price distortions, lack of managerial skills, and obsolete
equipment.

The greater autonomy that had been given to
lower-level units in 1979-80 led, to a certain82 1983 Regional Perspectives

 

extent, to a low rate of growth in government
revenues. Meanwhile. the planned reductions in
investment were not realized. This caused unexpectedly large budget deficits that were accompanied by some unwelcome price rises (the latter
resulting partly from greater freedom in price
setting). In response. investment (particularly in
large, centrally controlled projects) was cut
drastically and price controls were strengthened,
which reduced the budget deficit and stabilized
prices. Output growth was slow in 1981 (there was
a3 percent real increase in national income). but
recovered impressively in 1982 (there was a 7
percent real increase in national income).

The investment cuts reduced imports of
equipment; they also depressed output from
heavy industry. which lowered domestic energy
consumption and enabled energy exports to be
maintained. China’s manufactured exports continued their expansion despite the world recession. Expansion was restrained, however, by an
increasing number of protectionist barriers
abroad.

The net effect of these policies on the balance
of payments was to turn a current-account deficit
of about $2.5 billion in [980 into a surplus of over
$4 billion in 1982, equivalent to two-and-a-half
months’ imports. However. the surplus may only
be temporary: a moderate current-account deficit is expected by 1984.

China is thus well placed to resume a more
normal ievel of investment. within the framework of the recently published sixth five-year plan.
Yet. the requirements for external finance,
especially concessional aid to help finance its
development and modernization programs, will
increase substantially during the remainder of the
decade. New investment will emphasize energy
production and transport infrastructure, two
major constraints facing the economy: this
emphasis is to be complemented by an extensive
investment program to modernize the country’s
huge but technologically backward industrial
sector. The Bank's lending program reflects this

 

 

emphasis: support for high-level manpower
development and expansion of agricultural output is also continuing.

The Vulnerable Remainder

At the opposite end of the spectrum from
China~-in terms of size and vulnerability—are
Laos and the island countries of the Pacific—
Papua New Guinea and the smaller island states.
All have been seriously affected by the world
recession. Less developed than the other countries of the region. with apen economies, and
heavily dependent on the export of a small number of commodities, they have had little choice
but to adjust to the impact of the recession.

During both 1981 and 1982. Laos continued the
process of recovery from the very low levels of
economic activity brought about between 1975
and 1977 by the aftermath of war. poor climate.
and shortages of foreign exchange. Economic
recovery—there has been an average growth in
GNP of about 7 percent in reai terms over the past
four years-—-has been led by agriculture, and. in
particular, by rice production. Indeed, in 1982,
the country was self-sufficient in food for the first
time in many vears.

Papua New Guinea, a moderate-sized country
in terms of population. experienced a fall in the
value of its exports of 10 percent in 1982. which
followed a 22 percent drop in 1981. [ts two most
important products, copper concentrates
(including gold) and coffee, together account for
60 percent of total exports. [n 1982. exports of the
former fell in value by one-third: coffee fared as
badly. A decline in the terms of trade, equivalent to 15 percent of GDP over the period 198 182, was also registered. Since exports are the primary source of incomes and government revenués, a severe strain has been placed on the
country’s development efforts. The government
reacted to straitened circumstances by reducing
public expenditures by 5 percent in real terms. and
targeting cuts in public-service employment by
3,000, or about 6 percent of the total.South Asia 83

 

South Asia

In a number of major respects. the economic
performance of the countries in the South Asia
region in fiscal 1983 was similar to that of the
previous year. Despite the deepening world
recession, and notwithstanding the effects of a
poor monsoon, by and large the economies of the
region again demonstrated an encouraging resiliency against adversity and a capacity to sustain
their economic development.

Although the pace of growth slackened and
balance-of-payments deficits— accentuated by
weakening terms of trade—remained of concern, the toll that might otherwise have been taken
by the recession was eased by the countries’
domestic policies, as well as by foreign assistance, which, to most countries of the region. was
maintained at. or exceeded. levels of the previous year, although, in some cases, it was on
harder terms. As a consequence of the tance
received on concessional terms in the past and of
their own prudent debt-management policies.

 

 

 

South Asian countries have been spared the more
serious problems encountered in some other
developing regions in the management of external debt.

While generalizations for the region need to be
qualified to allow for individual variations,
adjustments to the impact of world recession were
of two varietics: short-term measures aimed at
responding to the pressures resulting from the
weakening of external demand and policies with
a longer-term focus directed at altering the
structure of countries’ economies.

In the first category were measures to restrain
the growth of domestic spending (public investment and various subsidies. for instance) and
imports. while simultaneously attempting to raise
domestic revenues. Policies to enhance longerrange productivity and improve balance-of-payments positions included measures to increase
producer incentives and stimulate greater efficiency in production, policies to promote exports.

India: Positive Aspects

After two years of fairly solid performance.
following the recovery from the drought of 1979.
the poor monsoon in mid-1982 caused India to
face a difficult year in fiscal 1983. Food-grain
production, which hit a record 133 million tons
in fiscal 1982, is expected to fall to around 125
million tons in fiscal 1983. In total, agricultural
value added may drop from between 4 percent and
5 percent. Industrial production is expected to
grow by 4 percent, down from & percent the year

before. This slackening of growth resulted from
several factors, the more important of which were
a decline in agricultural income, persistent
(though lessened) power shortages, anda textile
strike in Bombay. This combination will bring
down the economywide rate of growth in gross
domestic product (GDP) to around 2 percent, as
compared with 8 percent and 5.2 percent in the
previous two years. While somewhat disappointing, the performance of the Indian economy in fiscal 1983 was significantly stronger than
that which followed the 1979 drought; then, foodgrain production was 109 million tons. and GDP
feil by about 5.5 percent.

There were, therefore, positive aspects to the
past year’s performance. Inflation was held to 2.2
percent in 1982, down from 9 percent the year
before and down, as well, from the high rates in
previous years of drought. Food prices did rise
during the summer of 1982, but successful eco

nomic-management policies (primarily a blend
of domestic procurement and distribution efforts
and timely efforts to import 4.5 million tons of
wheat) were able to mitigate this and some other
adverse effects of the drought. Despite the need
to import agricultural products to offset lower
levels of domestic production, the total volume
of imports grew by less than | percent, thanks to
significant gains in domestic production of
cement, fertilizer, and other basic goods. Coupled with growth in the volume of exports of about
5 percent and a slight improvement in terms of
trade, India’s balance-of-payments position
improved in fiscal 1983. The current-account
deficit, which had been $3.8 billion and 2.5 percent of GDP in fiscal 1982. declined to $3.4 billion and to 2.2 percent of GDP.

The year’s improvement in the balance of payments, to a significant degree, is the result of
India’s development and adjustment efforts over
the past three years. The improvement (in terms

_ of current-account deficit as a percent of GDP)

would have been even greater had not the drought
both increased the need for imports of food and
decreased the growth in GDP. Nevertheless, it is
expected that the country’s balance of payments
will be under strain for the next several years. for
India’s development strategy itself generates a
significant demand for imports. Imports of raw
materials, capital goods, and modern technology and equipment are required to allow for
additional capacity, increase existing utilization
of capacity, and enhance efficient production for
both domestic and export markets. India’s efforts
to reduce imports through efficient substitution
of domestic production have yielded substantial
benefits, particularly in terms of oil imports, which
have dropped from 64 percent of consumption in
fiscal 1980 to 47 percent in fiscal year 1983. However, demand for India’s exports, while sufficient in some product categories to allow for some
volume growth over the last two years, continues
to be adversely affected by the world recession.
That the country has been able to attain significant growth in exports in such conditions is
heartening.

In the past few years, bottlenecks in key areas
of infrastructure have caused major problems for
the economy and constrained economic growth
and performance. India’s Sixth Five-Year Plan,
adopted in 1981, in addition to concentrating on
an easing of infrastructural constraints (particularly in power and transport), focuses on export
promotion, production of import substitutes
where economically justifiable, implementation
of an energy program designed to encourage
conservation and expand domestic production,
and maintenance of growth in the agricultural
sector. Recent easing of shortages and bottlenecks has come primarily from better utilization86 1983 Regional Perspectives

 

of existing capacity. In the future, however, most
improvements must result from added capacity—thus the importance of adequate resource
mobilization to allow for the full implementation
of the Sixth Plan. India has made a major effort
in this direction by raising railway tariffs,
increasing the retail prices of petroleum products, and also by raising prices of a number of
items produced by public enterprises. Even if the
domestic-savings effort, which is already quite
high (over 20 percent) is increased, resources
necessary for investment will remain tight.
External finance, therefore, will continue to be
an important supplement to India’s investment
resources.

This increasing requirement for external
finance comes at a time when concessional aid has
become scarce. Aid disbursements in real terms
from all donors declined throughout the 1970s
and, based on known commitment levels, are
expected to continue to decline. Terms of aid from
the World Bank. in particular, have hardened,
resulting from the increasing share of IBRD
lending relative to that of IDA. The average cost
of all borrowing will also continue to rise as a
more-creditworthy India increases its access to
commercial sources of finance.

Governments Act to Adjust

After a period of sustained growth and development, Bangladesh suffered setbacks in both
fiscal years 1981 and 1982. Economic growth,
which averaged 5.8 percent a year between fiscal
1975 and 1981, slowed down to 1 percent in fiscal
1982. The balance of payments and the budget
came under severe pressure, and investment levels—both public and private—had to be cut back.
In the past year, government policies designed to
cope with these economic difficulties, as well as
the decline in oil prices, partially alleviated balance-of-payments and budgetary pressures;
nevertheless, economic growth is expected to be
only about 2.5 percent as a result of drought and
recession in the economy.

The global recession and poor harvests have both
contributed to Bangladesh’s recent economic difficulties. The international recession severely
affected export demand for, and prices of, raw jute
and jute goods and of other important exports and
led to a 35 percent decline in the terms of trade
between fiscal 1980 and fiscal 1982. During the same
period, inflows of aid stagnated. Since these inflows
finance about half of total imports, and since importbased taxes provide 60 percent of government revenues, the government’s ability to finance both
imports and its development budget was reduced.
In addition, a series of poor crops, caused by
drought, necessitated substantial imports of food
grains on commercial terms (further straining a
weak balance of payments), reduced rural incomes

and the demand for goods and services produced
by the nonagricultural sector, and generally reduced
economic activity throughout the past two years.

‘The government responded to these difficulties
in fiscal 1982 by restraining import growth through
restrictions on imports and bank credit, by depreciating the taka by 22 percent in relation to the US
dollar, and by cutting back public-sector development spending. In the past year, several further bold
measures were taken to improve the budgetary situation. They included a further 20 percent depreciation of the taka, substantial increases in prices
of key commodities and services supplied by the
public sector. a significant effort to increase resource
mobilization, a reordering of the public-investment program, and a limitation of its size to ava
able resources. A sharp increase in workers’
remittances and increased aid inflows (donors have
provided more food and commodity aid) have also
helped Bangladesh cope with the external-payments situation of the past year.

A continuation of the government's recent policies should help to place the Bangladesh economy
ona footing that would permit it to benefit from an
international economic recovery. However, the
scope for increasing exports in the short term is
limited, although export incentives are being progressively increased. Special emphasis is also being
placed on the production of food grains and fertilizers, the substitution of imported petroleum by
domestic natural gas, increasing the role of the private sector in economic activity. and on devising a
new trade and industrial policy to foster efficient
industrialization. Nevertheless. the balance-ofpayments and budgetary outlook for the next few
years will remain tight, and unless external-resource
inflows are substantially increased, overall growth
of investment and economic activity will be
adversely affected.

Despite several adverse circumstances—and
especially the world recession—Pakistan's real GDP
is projected to grow at about 6.2 percent in fiscal
1983, equaling the mark achieved in the previous
year. In contrast, both balance-of-payments and
budgetary positions have deteriorated, largely as a
result of the slowdown in the world economy and
falling commodity prices. Mainly as the result of the
depressed state of the world rice and cotton markets, exports have been sharply lower in the past
two years. Pakistan’s balance-of-payments situation, as fiscal year 1983 drew to a close, remained
manageable, however. Contributory factors were
improvements in world trade and commodity prices
late in the year, the favorable effect on migrant
remittances and a number of minor exports of
adjustments in the value of the rupee, and the continued flow of resources from the IMF’s Extended
Fund and Compensatory Financing Facilities.
Despite the 17 percent increase in its external
indebtedness since 1978, debt servicing is not aspressing a problem for Pakistan as it is for some
other developing countries. In fiscal 1982, Pakistan’s public and publicly held guaranteed external
debt amounted to only 25 percent of total GNP, and
debt service was only 13.6 percent of the exports
of goods and services.

Supported by an Extended Fund Facility
arrangement and a structural-adjustment credit
from IDA, tighter demand-management and supply-side measures have been adopted to promote
structural adjustment and to increase efficiency and
production in those key sectors that can contribute
to better balance-of-payments performance. In
agriculture, producer prices have been raised to
bring them more in line with international prices.
Subsidies on fertilizers and herbicides have been
reduced, while efforts have been made to increase
the supply of inputs and the availability of credit.
Investment is being increasingly directed towards
rehabilitation of the irrigation system and improvement of water conservation and of drainage
facilities in waterlogged and saline areas. Water
charges have also been increased to detray higher
operational and maintenance costs. In industry,
steps have been taken to improve the climate for
the private sector through constitutional guarantees against arbitrary nationalization, tax and
trade incentives, and simplified investment-sanctioning procedures. To reorient the trade regime
towards exports, incentives for exports have been
increased and a program of phased import liberalization initiated. In the field of energy. government initiatives include a strengthening of energy
planning, encouragement of private-sector participation in energy development (through increases
in producer prices for oil and gas to encourage
increased exploration and development), and
increases in consumer prices of oil and gas to
encourage conservation.

Affected by the Weather

Growth of GDP in Sri Lanka is estimated at 5.1
percent in real terms in 1982. compared with an
annual average growth of 6.5 percent over the
previous four years. The slower growth is
explained by a drop in tea and paddy production—partly due to drought—and a contraction
in construction activities, apparently influenced
by the uncertainty of an election year in Sri Lanka
and the restraint in government spending on
housing and urban development. Budgetary
pressures remained strong in 1982, and the overall budget deficit increased from 15.7 percent of
GDP in 198] to 17.4 percent in 1982. Net foreign
financing continued to fill about half the financing gap, and the growing share of foreign commercial borrowing by both the public and private
sectors had adverse implications for Sri Lanka’s
debt-service burden. Payments of interest and
amortization on all external debt are now equiv
South Asia 87

alent to about 20 percent of total exports of goods
and services.

A number of adjustments are needed to alleviate continued large deficits in the budget and
the balance of payments. Steps have been taken
to add to the revenues of the central] government
by increasing import duties and business-turnover taxes. These, together with restraint in
spending, are expected to reduce substantially the
need for deficit financing from domestic sources
during 1983; a more comprehensive program to
encourage production of both exports and import
substitutes is also essential. A heavy dependence
on both foreign remittances and inflows of foreign capital makes Sri Lanka particularly vulnerable to repercussions from the changing attitudes
and financial situations in the Middle East and
donor countries.

Nepal’s economic performance continues to be
heavily influenced by the weather and by international demand for its exports. Good harvests
in 1981 and 1982 resulted in real GDP growth of
between 4 percent and 5 percent in those years.
Increased agricultural output, in turn. usually
results in strong export gains (as in 1981). particularly of food grains. In 1982, however, despite
another sharp increase in rice exports. total export
earnings remained at the previous year’s level as
a result of a decline in jute and nontraditional
exports (hides, skins, handicrafts). Thus, despite
a substantial slowdown in the growth of imports,
Nepal's trade deficit widened further to 10.2
percent of GDP in 1982. As in previous years,
about two-fifths of this deficit was offset by net
earnings from tourism, other services, and
remittances: further increases in foreign grants
and concessional loans resulted in an overall balance-of-payments surplus. Nepal's external debt
is currently less than 10 percent of gross domestic product. and its annual debt-service ratio is less
than 2 percent of GDP. To address its weakening trade balance, the government last year
enacted a new trade policy aimed at promoting
exports, substituting imports, and rationalizing
trade.

Weak monsoons in fiscal 1983s growing season caused a decline in food-grain production
during the past year estimated at 17 percent below
the 4 million metric tons obtained in 1982. Quick
procurement of emergency food grains by the
government and assistance from donors staved
off major shortfalls in supplies. but exports of food
grains had to be curtailed. This development
underscored the need to strengthen efforts at
raising long-term agricultural productivity
through irrigation and better water management. added capability in the country’s agriculture-extension service, an adequate and timely
supply of fertilizers and other inputs, additional
farmer credits. and improved marketing.88 1983 Regional Perspectives

Export Boost Needed

Burma’s real GDP is estimated to have grown
by about 6 percent in fiscal 1983, supported by
yet another record level of paddy production.
Generally, however, Burma’s economic performance over the past year has been seriously
constrained by an unfavorable export market for
the country’s principal crops, particularly rice.
Favorable agricultural production, combined with
the slowdown in export growth, has led to a sharp
increase in inventories of rice and other exportables. The decline in real export earnings has had
the effect of reducing public-sector revenues and
restricting imports to essential intermediate and
capital goods. However, Burma’s overall external position weakened in 1982.

Various adjustment measures are now being
taken in Burma to sustain growth with price stability in the face of adverse export-market conditions. [In 1983, the growth of public investment
(in nominal terms) is being held to 5 percent (as
compared with 43 percent in 1982), Additional
revenues are being sought through a strengthening of the tax administration. And, over the
medium-term, the government has announced
plans to diversify Burma’s agricultural output into
crops other than rice and to foster agroindustrial
activities with export potential. To this end, the
public-investment program is being focused more
on export-oriented sectors within the framework
of anew four-year plan.Europe, Middle East, and North Africa 89

Europe, Middle East, and North Africa

The slowdown in global economic growth during fiscal year 1983 has formed the background
to the difficult development and adjustment
efforts of the Bank’s member countries in the
Europe, Middle East, and North Africa
(EMENA) region. Despite the widely disparate
social, economic, and political characteristics of
these countries—with per capita incomes ranging from among the highest for current IBRD
borrowers (such as Cyprus and Yugoslavia) to the
very low per capita income levels of the People’s
Democratic Republic of Yemen and the Yemen
Arab Republic (both recipients of IDA credits)—the need for adjustment to changing economic conditions represents a widely shared
common denominator.

During the recent past, the international economic environment has been an unsettled one,
and these countries have sought to adjust to significant fluctuations in energy and food prices,
slower growth in the industrial economies,

increasing restrictions on international trade, and
difficult conditions in the international financial
markets as interest rates rose and private capital
flows decreased substantially. Simultaneously,
earlier domestic economic policies, which led to
public-sector imbalance and uneconomic investments, have reinforced the need for adjustment.
While in a number of countries the medium-term
adjustment process may be well in place and is
already bearing its first fruits, in others, only the
first beginnings have been set in motion. With only
a modest near-term recovery foreseen for the
more developed economies, the task of adjustment is likely to continue to be a difficult one.

Oil Exporters: Less Room for Manoeuvre

Until recently, events had not forced the
region’s net oil-exporting borrowers to carry out
comprehensive economic-adjustment programs. However, as a result of recent declines in
prices of, and demand for, petroleum, coupled

with reduced financial flows through international capital markets, the process of adjustment
has become imperative for them, also.

For several years, Egypt has benefited from an
unprecedented growth in revenue from petroleum exports, earnings from the Suez Canal,
emigrant remittances, and tourist receipts; yearly
growth in gross domestic product (GDP) averaged over 8 percent. In 1982, however, as a result
of the impact of the international recession on
these sources of earnings, the country’s currentaccount deficit widened to nearly 14 percent of
GDP. its fiscal deficit reached 22 percent of GDP,
and growth in GDP slowed. Inflation was at an
officially estimated annual rate of 17 percent.
Although a large proportion of capital inflows
remains concessional, the burden of debt-service payments has increased moderately—to about
21 percent of the value of goods-and-services
exports in fiscal year 1982. While some corrective measures have been taken to address this
adverse turn of events, more comprehensive
policy reforms are needed to help the economy
sustain rapid economic growth and provide for
increased employment. The policies should be
designed to exploit more fully the economic
potential of Egypt and should comprise measures aimed at increased mobilization of domestic
resources, trade policies to encourage more rapid
export growth and economically justified import

substitution, further alignment of domestic prices
with opportunity costs, more efficient financial
markets, and improved investment decisions in
industry and agriculture. The need also exists to
raise the productive efficiency and financial
soundness of public-sector enterprises.

Algeria’s recent economic-management policies—on both the external and domestic fronts—
have cushioned the impact of destabilizing exogenous forces and supported initiation of a process of internal adjustment. During 1980, 1981, and
1982, growth of nonhydrocarbon GDP averaged
about 7 percent. Imports have been constrained
to fit within the limits permitted by exports and
prudent management of foreign debt, while the
growth in the budget of the public sector has been
restrained. Concurrently, the authorities are
implementing a program of governmental reorganization, regional and public-sector decentralization, financial restructuring of industrial and
agricultural enterprises in the public sector. and
incentives to small-scale activities in the private
sector through credit and fiscal policies. The Bank
has continued its dialogue with the government
to identify those possible lending operations for
which the Bank’s contribution of staff and financial resources could be the most productive.

As a result primarily of a downturn in agricultural output, Tunisia’s GDP growth rate in 1982

Opportunities for Broader Adjustment

There are several countries in the region which,
while having already introduced tentative stabilization measures to adapt their economies to
changed circumstances, have yet to follow through
with more comprehensive adjustment programs.

Since the latter part of the 1970s, Morocco has
been beset by large fiscal and external-account
imbalances. [ts attempt to retrench on expansionary investment programs in the face of the

phosphates—a principal export—was complicated by sharp increases in energy prices, in
interest rates on international capital markets, and
in imports of cereals induced by a severe drought
in 1981. Growth in GDP, which had fallen to 4
percent a year during the period 1978-80, turned
negative in 1981 and then recovered in 1982
(owing primarily to a good harvest). External debt
service has increasingly become burdensome,
despite increased access to concessional assistance since 1980. Additional adjustment measures, focusing on reducing the budgetary and
external-account deficits, rationalizing the
investment program of the public sector, redesigning trade policies to provide greater export
incentives, and reducing distortions in the price
system remain to be taken. The Bank’s lending
program supports such adjustment measures and

In Portugal, growth in GDP of 3.3 percent in
1982 far outstripped the average for the member
countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). However, this growth was accompanied by a substantial worsening of the current-account deficit.
Inflation continued at a relatively high rate of
about 22 percent, and the budget deficit of the
public sector is expected to be at about the level,
as a percentage of GDP, of 1982. This fiscal
imbalance, to a large extent, has resulted from
interest increases on the accumulated public debt,
as well as from transfers to public-sector enterprises. The relatively large proportion (about 30
percent) of the country’s external debt with nearterm maturities further complicates the readjustment process, although the government is
making considerable efforts to reduce this proportion. The government has moved to restore
the escudo to an appropriate level through
devaluation measures, to adjust domestic prices
of important commodities, and adjustments in
administrative prices have started to be implemented as a means of reducing subsidies. thus
contributing to the reduction of the public-sector
deficit. Domestic interest rates have been raised
to generally positive real levels, and other monetary and fiscal policies have been tightened. The
authorities face a substantial challenge in correcting this deterioration in the internal economic situation at a time of slow world economic
growth. Simultaneously, major restructuring
efforts have assumed a sense of urgency as Portugal moves to join the European Communities
in the near future.

Through the introduction of vigorous demandmanagement and trade-policy measures, Romania
has sought to correct the imbalances that devel
oped during its rapid growth in the 1970s and that
were aggravated by the changed environment on
international capital markets. Aggregate growth of
demand has been moderated through cutbacks in
consumption and investment growth rates. Growth
in GDP is estimated to have been about 4 percent
in 1982, up from the 1981 rate of 3 percent. While
consumption was constrained, investment grew by
3 percent. Special emphasis has been given to the
expansion of energy production, exports, and
import substitution. A remarkable turnaround in
the current-account balance has occurred. from a
deficit of $2.4 billion in 1980 to a surplus of $250
million in 1982. These efforts towards short-term
stabilization have been accompanied by a more
balanced blend of directives emanating from the
centra] economic-planning authorities and by
reforms of pricing mechanisms, interest rates, and
exchange-rate policies to align domestic prices more
closely with relative resource costs. As these policy initiatives progress further and permeate the
resource-allocation processes, a resumption of
economic growth rates in accord with the economy’s longer-term prospects is entirely feasible.

At the start of the decade, Yugoslavia introduced a series of economic-stabilization measures
to correct its deteriorating external-accounts situation. Aggregate demand was compressed, and
GDP growth fell to 1.5 percent in 1981 and 0.5
percent in 1982; real investment levels fell in both
years. With these stabilization measures in hand,
the current-account deficit was reduced from $1.8
billion in 1980 to $750 million in 1981, and to less
than $100 million in 1982. In addition to the
exchange-rate policies and interest-rate policies
already introduced, it is anticipated that further
initiatives will be taken during calendar 1983 in the
areas of trade policy, investment rationalization. and
demand management. (This adjustment process is
being supported by a concerted response of the
Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the
international financial community, which negotiated a package of financial support earlyi in 1983 to
assist Yugoslavia through its short-term problem
of external financial liquidity.) These policies, which
form part of the country’s medium-term adjustment program, should provide a firm basis on which
the economy can establish a sustainable rate of
economic growth.

 

Progress in Structural Adjustment

A few of the active borrowing member countries in the region have already had in place for
several years programs of structural adjustment
in their economies.

In the case of Turkey, notable progress has been
achieved since the initiation in 1980 of a major
economic-reform program. Through a series of
demand-management and trade-policy measures, the inflation rate has been reduced from 107Europe, Middle East, and North Africa 93

 

percent in 1980 to 25 percent in 1982, while an
upsurge of exports, combined with modest import
demand, has reduced the current-account deficit
from 4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)
in 1981 to 2 percent in 1982. Concurrently, GDP
grew in 1981 and 1982 at over 4 percent, and
growth is projected to approach 5 percent in 1983.
The principal challenges on which the government is now concentrating are to: reinvigorate
private investment to provide a firm basis for
future sustained growth; increase the efficiency
of public-sector enterprises by giving them greater
operational] autonomy and introducing financial
discipline and a greater market orientation into
their activities: reform the financial sector; liberalize imports further; and rationalize further the
public-sector investment program. The Bank has
been supportive of the government’s reform
program; four structural-adjustment loans have
been approved since fiscal 1980, for a total of
$1,180.3 million; numerous other project loans,
totaling $1,458.9 million, have also been made.

The newest Bank member in the region, Hungary, is among those middle-income countries that
are implementing a multifaceted program of
economic adjustment that aims at harmonizing
the growth of aggregate demand and resource
availabilities to the changed external economic
environment. The program’s components are
being implemented within a longer-term policy
framework that is characterized by a greater reliance on prices, reduction of subsidies, macroeconomic policy signals to guide economic decisionmaking, a broadening of participation in
international trade, and an increase in the managerial and financial autonomy of enterprises. The
combination of a modest (about 2 percent) growth
of GDP in 1982 (led by a good harvest) and
restraints and cutbacks in consumption and
investment resulted in a deficit in Hungary's
convertible-currency current account of only
about $100 million in 1982; the account is projected to show a surplus of around $500 million
in calendar 1983. External debt is anticipated to
lessen slightly and its maturity structure to
lengthen. During this first year of Hungary's
membership in the IBRD, a comprehensive
report on the economy was completed, and two
loans, one for industrial restructuring and the
other to support agricultural mechanization and
grain storage, were approved by the Executive
Directors.

Low-income Countries

IDA is currently active in only two countries in
the region. In the Yemen Arab Republic, GDP
growth in 1982—the first year of the new five-year
plan period—was in the 4 percent-to-5 percent
range. slightly less than the average for the previous plan period, but above the 3 percent figure

for 1981. The fiscal deficit reached a disquieting
17.5 percent of GDP in 1981, while the currentaccount deficit was 23 percent of GDP. The government reduced budgetary expenditures in 1982,
and the investment program comprised only fully
funded projects. Because the concessional element in the Yemen Arab Republic’s public-sector external debt is large, the debt-service burden
is a modest 5 percent of current-account receipts.

In December 1982, a major earthquake shook
the rural province of Dhamar, killing 1,600 and
leaving 150,000 people—a quarter of the population of that province—homeless. The Bank
prepared a damage-assessment report focusing
on the reconstruction needs—particularly housing—of the province. Partly as a result of that
report, some donors have already provided grant
funds for reconstruction; an IDA credit for that
purpose is in an advanced state of preparation.

Provisional data for 1981 suggest that GDP
growth in the People’s Democratic Republic of
‘Yemen was between 6 percent and 8 percent, a
propitious start for the 1981-85 Development Plan
period. Tragically, in early 1982, unusually severe
floods wrought widespread damage to productive infrastructure and caused severe crop losses.
(IDA responded with a $7 million roads-rehabilitation credit.) The GDP growth rate in 1982,
therefore, may fall to 4 percent or 5 percent; in
addition, the relative price stability of recent years
gave way as consumer prices increased by about
16 percent. The government budget deficit as a
percentage of GDP remained high, at about 29
percent, as did the current-account deficit, at 32
percent of GDP. The external debt (around 68
percent of GDP) has not resulted in the past in
burdensome service payments—3 percent of the
sum of exports and substantial remittance
receipts—owing to the highly concessional nature
of most external finance. However, the rapid
growth of imports arising from the country’s
ambitious development plan and flood-rehabilitation efforts suggests the need for a review and
reassessment of priorities.

Assistance to Lebanon

During fiscal year 1983, the Bank responded
to the urgent request of the Government of
Lebanon that it play a central role in assessing the
country’s reconstruction needs and providing
rapid assistance to repair the extensive damage
to its economic and social infrastructure. Bank
missions visited Lebanon in November 1982 and
February 1983 and prepared a report reviewing
the situation in priority sectors: transportation,
water supply and sewerage, telecommunications, power, education, health, housing, and
urban development. Specific projects and studies were identified which could provide the basis
for a medium-term reconstruction program, and94 1983 Regional Perspectives

Capital-surplus, Oil-exporting Countries

In fiscal 1983. the decline of world oil prices and
reduced production by most capital-surplus. oilexporting countries caused a sharp fall in their oi
incomes. These negative factors became especially acute towards the end of calendar year 1982
and affected the scope of anticipated development expenditures for 1983. Given the current
relative excess production capacity. the short-run

 

stability of the pricing and production formulae
recently agreed to by the OPEC producers may
yet be subjected to further strain. Under the circumstances. there may be a need to cut back on
planned investment programs and/or stretch out
the completion of projects already begun. The
consequences of this course of action would be
adverse for the civil-works and contracting
industries in several countries and could be deleterious to expatriate labor demand and thus the
inflow of workers’ remittances to a number of
neighboring and Asian countries. Over the longer
run, should export-revenue growth stagnate or

Latin America and the Caribbean

During the past year, the economies of the
countries of the Latin America and the Caribbean region experienced further deterioration.
The magnitude, extent, and duration of the
decline that occurred in output. employment, and
income throughout the region has been unprecedented in the post-World War I] period. Virtually every country in Latin America experienced
a per capita decline in its real gross domestic
product (GDP). The year 1982 thus stands in
contrast with 1981, when all oil-exporting countries and even some oil importers continued to
have positive per capita growth in GDP. The
already difficult situation that developed in 1981
was compounded as the impact of the world
recession spread to most Latin American countries. The region’s GDP per capita declined 3
percent in 1982 and is now 5 percent below the
level of 1980. The fall in gross domestic income
per capita (a more accurate reflection of real

 

resource availability) since 1980 has been even
greater (7 percent) as a result of the marked
deterioration in the region’s terms of trade. Thus,
the impetus towards development was interrupted, as investments were scaled down or
rephased.

The marked slowdown in economic growth and
the external-debt difficulties that occurred in
several countries in Latin America in 1982 were
rooted in the external shocks and adjustment
process of the previous decade. Performance of
the Latin American economies following the first
round of oil-price increases and the world recession of the mid-1970s was one of the strongest of
any region in which oi!-importing countries predominate. Their impressive response was
achieved by increasing the availability of resources
for expanding investment, output. and employment. External resources were increased by
maintaining relatively high growth of exports and

by increased foreign borrowing. Increasing
interdependence with the world economy, a secular trend for the past thirty years, accelerated in
the second half of the 1970s.

The sharp deceleration of growth in the industrial countries since 1980, together with Latin
America’s increased interdependence with the
world economy (and consequent greater vulnerability to external shocks), resulted in the deteriorating external position and slowdown of
growth that has occurred in most countries in the
region since 1980. High real rates of interest in
international capital markets. declining demand
for their exports in industrial countries, collapse
of newly developed markets in some oil-exporting countries outside the region, severely
depressed prices for major export commodities
(copper. lead, nickel. silver, and tin among metals and coffee, wheat, sugar. soybeans, corn, and
fishmeal among foodstuffs). increased protection in several important trading partners, anda
decline in intra-Latin American trade operated
to reduce growth in all Latin American countries. While the entire region experienced difficulties in 1982 as a consequence of the adverse
external environment, some of the problems could
have been influenced. to a certain extent, by
domestic policies and the unique circumstances
of each country.

The second round of oil-price increases in 1979—
80 and continued high levels of external borrow
ing made it possible for most oil-exporting countries in Latin America to maintain ambitious
development programs and high rates of economic growth through 1981 despite a weakening
world economy. A softening of world petroleum
markets in 1981 and 1982, however. resulted in
considerable pressure on the balance of payments of these countries. To stem the deterioration in their reserve and payments positions, most
were forced to reduce their external borrowing
and development expenditures: for the first time
in over a decade, their economies showed no
growth. While it is true that these countries have
increased their dependence on petroleum revenues, the large investments they made in the 1970s
are expected to contribute to accelerated growth
in the second half of the 1980s.

Decline of Trade

One of the most striking changes that occurred
in Latin America during the past year was the
decline in the region's international trade, During the 1970s, expansion of trade provided many
of the countries in Latin America an avenue for
growth, industrialization, and diversification of
their economies. Export earnings grew rapidly in
that decade compared with the rest of the developing world. Sustained expansion of exports
provided the resources to acquire the imported
goods and technology essential for sustaining
accelerated investment, technological innova

tion, and growth in productivity. In 1982, Latin
America’s export earnings declined by about [0
percent, the first such decline in over three decades. This decline was mostly the result of the
sharp fall in world prices of the region's major
exports.

To curb the deficits in most Latin American
countries’ balance of payments and to reduce
financing requirements, which rose steadily after
1977, governments in the region were forced to
cut imports. This action had an adverse effect on
economic growth throughout Latin America. The
value of imports fell by 20 percent during 1982:
most of this fall (84 percent) represented reductions in the volume of imported goods.

The decline in trade was widespread. Only Colombia expanded both its imports and its export
earnings. As a result of restrictive demand-management and import policies. Latin America’s
merchandise trade balance moved from deficit in
198] toa surplus of $9 billion in 1982. However. an
explosive rise in factor payments abroad, the result
of higher interest payments on external borrowing. absorbed most (80 percent) of the additional
resources generated by a strengthened trade balance. Factor payments abroad doubled from 1980
to 1982 and are now equivalent to 40 percent of
exports. The net result of these large swings in the
components of the current account was a reduc
 

 

tion in the region’s current-account deficit from $38
billion in 1981 to $33 billion in 1982. Thus, despite
the sharp rise in factor payments abroad. most
countries in Latin America were able to reduce the
deficit in their current accounts and, as a consequence, reduce their recourse to foreign borrowing. as well.

Reduced Capital Flows

During 1982, there was a marked decline in
capital flows to Latin America. In previous years.
such flows had made it possible to finance sizable
current-account deficits and to sustain high levels of investment, growth, and employment. By
contrast. the principal mode of adjustment to
external imbalance forced on most Latin American countries in 1982 was reduced growth. Net
disbursements to the region fell to half the 1981
level. This marked decline was the result of the
increased cost of borrowing. a deliberate effort
by several governments to reduce external borrowing. and of greater caution on the part of
commercial banks. Given the continued rise in
interest payments and declining net disbursements, net transfers to Latin American countries
in 1982 were negative for the first time in the postWorld War II period. However. some countries
have had negative net transfers on medium- and
long-term debt over the period 1979-1982.98 1983 Regional Perspectives

For the first time in over a decade, Latin
American countries were forced to finance a
major portion of their current-account deficits by
drawing down their foreign-exchange reserves.
The reserve loss in the region totaled $11 billion
in 1982. All countries in the region, with the
exception of Peru and E] Salvador, experienced
falling foreign-exchange reserves. Latin America’s international reserves had by year-end
declined to $34 billion, equivalent to just two
months of the region’s imports of goods and
services.

The Caribbean Countries

The economies of the Caribbean countries
continued in 1982 to be buffeted by the ill winds
of the international recession. These small, open.
typically island economies have a highly vulnerable export sector concentrated in just four
activities—production of sugar. bauxite/alumina, and bananas and tourism. During 1981, the
demand for their exports dropped sharply; in
1982. further drops in export volume were minimal, but declines in prices, some to record real
post-war lows, put further pressure on already
badly strained foreign-exchange resources.
Moreover, as most Caribbean currencies are tied
to the US dollar, appreciation of that currency,
together with devaiuations in several Latin
American countries. reduced the competitiveness of Caribbean products in industrial-country
markets. Finally, financial difficulties in their oilrich neighbors. Mexico. Trinidad and Tobago. and
Venezuela, cut sharply into flows of aid to Caribbean countries.

The adverse trend in the balance of payments
was reflected in the growth performance of these
economies. Real per capita income growth rates
were lower in 1982 than in 1981: for Barbados,
Belize, Guyana, and Jamaica. they were negative. While the early months of 1983 appear to
indicate the beginning of a mild upturn. it will be
quite some time before these economies fully
recover.

The mini-economies of many Caribbean
countries possess limited resources. both human
and financial. Asa result, they must rely on export
expansion and diversification of their economic
base to attain long-term economic viability.
External assistance is required in relatively large
amounts. In view of the limited creditworthiness
of these countries. much of the external a
ance must be on concessional terms, and a substantial portion of available concessionary
assistance must be directed toward implementing an export-oriented development strategy.

The Caribbean Group for Cooperation in
Economic Development continues its role in the
coordination of assistance to its developing
member countries. The next meeting of the Group

 

 

  

as a whole will take place in December 1983;
during the past year, ad hoc meetings were held
for Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica. and St. Vincent
and the Grenadines.

Restructuring External Debt

During the past decade, the countries of Latin
America increased their medium-term and longterm public external debt® by an average of 23
percent annually, slightly higher than that of other
developing countries (19 percent). Latin America now has the largest external debt (public and
private medium-term and long-term debt is estimated at $203 billion) of any region in the developing world. This debt is concentrated in a
relatively few countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile.
Mexico, and Venezuela. Together, they account
for 75 percent of the region’s total outstanding
debt.

Many of the semi-industrial countries of Latin
America are at a stage similar to that of North
America in the late 1800s, when foreign capital
played a major role in accelerating development. Transformation of these economies was
substantial between 1950 and 1980. During this
period, population more than doubled, the pace
of econamic growth was rapid. industrialization
and urbanization accelerated. and significant
progress was made in health. education, and in
the provision of basic social services. These
impressive gains were achieved through large
investments in productive capacity and economic and social infrastructure.

The flow of external resources to Latin American countries accelerated the pace at which these
countries have achieved their development
objectives. Expansion of resources provided the
basis for the rapid growth of the region’s trade
with the rest of the world, which occurred during
the past decade and which itself required
increased financing from abroad in the form of
short-term, self-liquidating trade credits. From
the longer-term developmental perspective, the
countries of Latin America will continue to be net
capital importers for the foreseeable future.

Superimposed on the secular requirement for
external resources to finance infrastructure.
industrialization, and modernization of agriculture was the need on the part of the oil-importing
countries of the region for temporary adjustment financing to ensure the continuity of their

ly.growth and development in the face of the post1973 disruptions in the world economy.

As noted, following the first round of oil-price
increases and the world recession of the mid1970s, most Latin American countries that were
in a position to do so, borrowed abroad to ease
adjustment to the deteriorating external environment. The countries that were most successful in sustaining the impetus of development in
the face of these external shocks simultaneously
expanded investment, output, employment, and
trade. This expansion required that appropriate
export, savings. investment, and production
incentives {including pricing policies) be adopted
to ensure adequate mobilization of domestic
savings and the desired allocation of resources.

This process was critically dependent on the
availability of external finance. Such a mode of
adjustment benefited the capital-importing
countries—provided the borrowed resources were
used to accelerate economic development and
attention was given to expanding export earnings from which to service the incremental debt.
It also benefited the capital-exporting countries
by supporting growth of the world economy and
demand for their exports.

The most striking change in the region's external borrowing during this period of adjustment
was the shift away from official and bilateral
sources of finance providing concessional assistance to commercial sources. The share of Latin
America’s total external debt on commercial
terms has increased steadily over the past decade; it is now above 93 percent. Countries in Latin
America have made considerable progress over
the past several decades in expanding their
economies, and their capacity to carry increased
debt has also grown. Increased indebtedness,
however. has had the effect of dramatically
increasing the vulnerability of Latin American
countries to interest-rate fluctuations in the
Eurodollar market, since most of the debt that was
contracted was at variable interest rates. From
only 3 percent of the region’s external debt in
1970, variable-rate debt has risen to over twothirds of the region's debt. For other developing
countries at present. variable-rate debt comprises 21 percent of the total.

Average terms of total Latin American debt
have hardened over the past decade as a result of
the greater reliance on commercial sources
(average interest rate of 14.2 percent, maturity
in 10.1 years, with a 3.7-year grace period at
present, as compared with an average interest rate
of 7.1 percent, maturity of 14.3 years, with a grace
period of 3.6 years in 1970). Rapid growth of
borrowing. the shift in composition of that debt,
and the consequent hardening of terms have
resulted in rapid growth of the debt-service burden on countries in the region. In addition, most

 

 

Latin America and the Caribbean 99

Latin American countries have taken on a greater
amount of short-term debt during the past two
years. making roll-overs increasingly necessary.
The proportion of outstanding debt to gross
national product (GNP) for the region as a whole
has increased from 18 percent in 1970 to a current 30 percent. The debt-service ratio of countries in the region has risen from 26 percent in 1970
to 57 percent.® This increase in the debt-service
burden has been concentrated in relatively few
countries, most of which now have high debtservice ratios.

While the quality of management of external
borrowing has varied considerably among countries, such borrowing generally has played a positive role by contributing to the sustained
expansion of imports needed to accelerate
investment and growth of output. Avoidance of
liquidity problems for those countries that were
the heaviest borrowers was crucially dependent
on three external conditions:

@ that any recession in the industrial countries
and disruption of world trade would be of short
duration (that is, disruption would follow the
pattern of previous recessions that had occurred
in the post-World War II period);

® that real interest rates would stay within the
historic range that had prevailed over the previous three decades; and

® that commercial banks would provide
appropriate levels of net transfers of funds to
borrowing countries.

In the event, expectations throughout the industrial countries and Latin America concerning
these conditions were proven incorrect.

The result has been three fundamental mismatches. First, there has been a mismatch
between foreign-exchange earnings of the countries of Latin America over the past two years and
the rising debt burden that occurred on their variable-rate debt. Second. is that between the
maturity structure of the debt and the gestation
periods of the projects that these resources are
financing. Third, is a mismatch between the
capacity of the public sector to save and the
requirements of their large investment programs.

To aggravate the situation further, commercial banks became more cautious in 1982 in the
aftermath of the difficulties experienced by several Eastern European countries in servicing their
external debt. Total external debt in Latin
America increased 7 percent in 1982, or at onethird the pace of previous years.

Attacking the Problems

Since the second half of 1982, the situation has
improved. There is increased awareness

* On public and private debt.100 1983 Regional Perspectives

throughout the region that primary responsibility for overcoming these problems rests with the
countries themselves. To enhance the mobilization of resources and improve allocative efficiency. a number of countries are moving to
reduce the distortions that have been created by
some pricing, subsidy. and interest-rate policies.
The countries with the largest debt problems are
attempting to restructure the maturity of their
debts; some are also attempting to curb the growth
of consumption and restructure their investment
programs. Countries are also taking action to
expand and diversify their exports, add productive capacity to substitute for imports where this
can be done efficiently, and adopt financial policies that will discourage capital flight and attract
foreign capital.

Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico have adopted
measures aimed at attacking the disequilibria
that gave rise to the liquidity crisis. These measures, as Well as those of many smaller Latin
American countries, have received the support
of the International Monetary Fund, official
bilateral lenders, other international financial
institutions, and commercial banks. Participation of commercial banks. critical to the successful resolution of the short-term liquidity problems
these countries face. took the form of restructuring short-term debt into longer-term obligations, as well as provision of moderate amounts
of new capital.

Concurrently. there have been changes in the
external environment faced by most countries in
the region that. if they persist. will make these
liquidity problems more manageable. First.
nominal interest rates in the Eurocurrency market have declined sharply since mid-1982. The six
percentage-point decline in the London Interbank rate that has occurred since mid-1982
reduced the interest payments of Argentina,
Brazil. and Mexico by $7 billion annually (or 26
percent of total interest payments that would have
been due in 1982 had there been no drop in rates).
Second, current-account deficits in the balance
of payments of most Latin American countries
declined in 1982 and are continuing to decline.
Third, there is now evidence in the industrial
countries of a resumption of economic growth,
which is expected to lead to a resurgence of world
trade. Recovery is by no means certain, however, and it is now more important than before

that there be no lag between perceptions and
realities in the world economy.

For the oil-exporting countries, the situation
is today more difficult. The external position of
these countries deteriorated rapidly after mid1981 as world petroleum markets weakened and
demand for their nonpetroleum exports declined.
The cumulative effect of several years of large
current-account deficits in their balance of payments, stemming in part from large development programs and insufficient savings, gave rise
to steady increases in their external indebtedness. While the decline in nominal interest rates
during the second half of 1982 reduced the debtservice payments on their variable interest-rate
debt. lower petroleum prices reduced these
countries’ export earnings. Most have had to cut
imports, reduce development spending. and curb
economic growth.

Over the long term, Latin American countries. including the oil exporters. are weil positioned to resume strong growth. accelerate
development, and to reduce gradually their
dependence on external financing. Rates of population growth have begun to decline in most
countries. Simultaneously, domestic-savings
efforts have showed improvement throughout the
region. Latin America has considerable human
resources. unexploited energy and mineral
resources. and great potential for achieving further productivity increases in agriculture and
industry. Development of the region's infrastructure is greater than that of the rest of the
developing world. The foundation for strong
expansion of sustained production already exists.

Nevertheless, the problems that Latin American countries face in the short-term are formidable. It is likely that the achievement of
developmental objectives will have be delayed.
The liquidity problems that these countries are
facing are expected to continue for some time.
Over the medium term, however, these problems should prove manageable—provided economic health is restored on a worldwide ba:
expansion of international trade is resumed. and
the countries of the region implement and sustain policies that increase domestic savings, promote and diversify exports. improve allocative
efficiency, enhance public-sector financial viability, and improve income distribution.Chapter Five
Executive Board

With the exception of certain powers specifically reserved to them by the Articles of Agreement, the Governors of the Bank have delegated
their powers for the conduct of the general operations of the Bank to a Board of Executive
Directors that performs its duties on a full-time
basis at the Bank’s headquarters. There are
twenty-one Executive Directors; each Director
selects an Alternate. As provided for in the Articles of Agreement, five Directors are appointed
by the five members having the largest number
of shares of capital stock and the rest are elected
by the Governors representing the other members. The President of the Bank is Chairman of
the Board.

The Executive Directors fulfill dual responsibilities. They represent their constituents’ interests and concerns to the Board and management
when determining policy or considering individual projects, as well as the interests and concerns
of the Bank to the country or countries that
appointed or elected them. The Directors,
therefore, act as a two-way channel of communication between the Bank and the member
countries. Since the Bank operates on the basis
of consensus (formal votes are rare), this dual role
involves frequent communication and consultations with governments so as to reflect accurately their views in Board discussions.

Policy is decided by the Executive Directors
within the framework of the Articles of Agreement. The Directors consider and decide on the
loan and credit proposals made by the President.
They are also responsible for presentation to the
Board of Governors at its Annual Meeting of an
audit of accounts, an administrative budget, the
Annual Report on the operations and policies of
the World Bank, and any other matter that, in
their judgment, requires submission to the Board
of Governors. Matters may be submitted to the
Governors at the Annual Meeting or at any time
between Annual Meetings.

The growing volume and complexity of Bank
operations have been accompanied by detailed
consideration and determination of an increasing number of policy matters in recent years. The
Articles of Agreement are generai enough to give
the Executive Board sufficient flexibility to adjust
Bank policies to the realities of a changing world.
It does so in three general areas:

a) By its annual oversight of the financial and

 

Executive Board _10'

operating programs, and administrative budgets, it determines the allocation of financial and
staff resources for the coming year, informing
itself, in the process, of staff forecasts of expected
developments during the next five years:

b) By reviewing specific policy proposals, either
annually (for example. on the allocation of net
income, staff compensation, the research program) or periodically (for exampie. the Bank's
capital requirements. financial policies. lending
terms. sectoral priorities). it determines the
direction of Bank policies: and

c) By reviewing evaluations of completed Bank
projects and of the Bank’s experience in individual sectors and with particular policies, and by
considering proposals for future evaluation
activities. the Board ensures that the Bank and
member countries are able to benefit from the
essons of experience.

This pattern is evident in the major policy
decisions made in fiscal 1983. Thus, in accordance with (a), the Executive Directors set the
BRD lending program for fiscal 1984 at $12,000
million, with a $3,300 million IDA program
entailing, together, about 261 lending operations.
They considered the financial and operating
programs, and administrative budgets, and the
annual report on the Bank’s research program.
n the second half of fiscal 1983, they conducted
the mid-year review of the fiscal 1983 administrative budgets and the fiscal 1983 lending program, and considered the Bank's fiscal 1984
inancial and operating programs and extension
of IBRD/IDA programs through fiscal 1987, and
the fiscal 1984 administrative budgets.

In accordance with (b). the Executive Directors gave considerable attention to financial policy matters during the past fiscal year.

In mid-1982. they approved IBRD authority
to borrow in fiscal 1983 up to $1.5 billion in shortterm notes. completely new to the IBRD. Also
approved was the pooi-based variable lending rate
which, over time, will reduce the IBRD’s e
ing exposure to interest-rate risk. Later in fi
1983, in order to expand the discount-note program. the Directors authorized an increase in the
short-term US-dollar borrowings from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion. Also, ina review of the IBRD’s
liquidity policy, they approved new target levels
of liquidity and agreed that, to implement these.402 Executive Board

 

the IBRD’s borrowing program for fiscal 1983
could be increased by $1 billion, from $9.8 billion to $10.8 billion. With the expected rapid
growth in loans disbursed and outstanding
requiring substantial additions to reserves, the
Directors undertook a review of the IBRD’s
reserve policy and agreed on reserve objectives.
Also, they agreed on criteria for the allocation of
net income. Before the end of the fiscal year. the
Directors had completed a general review of the
new borrowing practices and lending-rate policy.

As another important response to the changes
in the Bank’s financial environment, the Executive Directors agreed that the Bank should commence a pilot program, for a trial period of two
years, of offering new instruments for cofinaneing with commercial banks. The Executive
Directors will be apprised of the progress of the
new cofinancing instruments; the first phase of the
operation will be reported on early in calendar
1984 and periodically thereafter. It was also
agreed that much more action was needed.
including continued expansion of the Bank’s
operational program, particularly in a period
when other sources of capital were more restricted
and the need for increased capital was great. This
meant that, at the appropriate time, the Directors should consider selective and general capital
increases.

In light of the further deterioration of the world
economic environment, the Bank revised its 1983
and 1984 fiscal-year programs to assist better its
borrowing member countries with policy advice
and special financial assistance to maintain the
maximum possible level of development activities and minimize the erosion of future growth
prospects. The Executive Directors approved a
program of special assistance to member countries for 1983 and 1984 which includes expanded
structural-adjustment lending. sector-adjustment support, and the financing of an increased
share of project costs.

The Executive Directors considered a report
entitled, **Worid Bank’s Poverty Focus.”’ and
endorsed its general conclusion that a balanced
strategy of growth, combined with poverty alleviation, provides the best general framework for
development in the 1980s. This policy should
remain a key and integral part of the Bank's
overall development and lending strategy.

The Directors considered a report on the future
of the Economic Development Institute and
approved in principle a five-year program
designed to make the Institute more responsive
to the needs of developing countries.

They considered the 1983 World Development
Report and agreed that the Report should be
transmitted to the Development Committee asa
staff paper. and be published.

The Directors approved the appointments of
the selection panel for the Robert S. McNamara
Fellowships.

Before the end of the 1983 fiscal year, they
received, for later discussion. staff studies on the
proposed multilateral investment-insurance
agency.

The Directors also lowered the front-end fee
charged by the IBRD, and approved a streamlining of arrangements for the Project Preparation Facility. which is designed to meet the needs
of member countries for assistance in accelerating project preparation and implementation.
Also, in terms of enhancing the resources available to IDA, they endorsed arrangements for
special contributions to the Association.

Annual reports with which the Directors dealt
related to project implementation and supervision, the activities of the Joint Audit Committee, the IBRD/IDA financial statements. the
Economic Development Institute, and the Staff
Retirement Plan.

In addition to formal. regular Board meetings. the Directors meet as the Committee of the
Whole to discuss certain matters prior to their
submission to the Board for formal action. They
also meet informally as frequently as required.
Periodically, the Executive Directors hold seminars with Bank management that permit more
informal discussion than can take place at regular Board meetings. Topics covered by the Committee of the Whole and in seminars during the
past fiscal year included cofinancing with commercial banks, external relations, the Bank’s
research program, rates of return in the Bank’s
project work, liquidity policy. methodologies for
updating the Bank’s operational per capita income
guidelines, the future of the EDI, the IBRD’s
lending plans and capital requirements, and borrowings from central banks.

As a result of the structural changes in the
working of the Development Committee, the
involvement of the Executive Directors in the
determination of the Committee's work program, and its work generally. has continued to
increase. These changes have continued to be
reflected, in an increasing measure, in all the
preparatory work undertaken for the meetings of
the Committee, held in September 1982 in
Toronto, Canada, and in April 1983, in Washington, DC. The Directors participate in all the
meetings of the Development Committee.

Three standing committees of the Board have
been established to aid the Executive Directors
in carrying out their duties. They are: the Committee on Directors’ Administrative Matters, the
Joint Audit Committee, and the Committee on
Staff Compensation Issues.

The Committee on Directors’ Administrative
Matters was established in 1968. It considers,makes recommendations. and reports its findings to the Executive Directors for their decision
on matters of adminstrative policies relating to
Executive Directors, Alternates, Advisers, and
their staffs. Its terms of reference involve it in a
wide spectrum of administrative matters and
charge it with responsibility of assisting Executive Directors. The Committee coordinates many
of its recommendations with a similar committee
established by the Executive Directors of the
International Monetary Fund. In making its recommendations, the Committee endeavors to
maintain a balance between the overall organizational and administrative objectives of the
institution and the unique circumstances faced by
the Executive Directors in discharging their
responsibilities.

The Committee meets as frequently as necessary, normally about once a month. The membership consists of six Executive Directors for a
term of two years after each regular election of
the Executive Directors, Since December 1980,
Said El-Naggar has served as its chairman.

The Joint Audit Committee was established in
1970, essentially to represent the shareholders of
the Bank in maintaining vigilance over the
soundness of the Bank’s financial practices and
procedures. In pursuing its responsibilities during fiscal 1983, the Committee nominated a firm
of private, independent, internationally established accountants to conduct the annual audits
of the IBRD, IDA, and the IFC, discussed with
them the scope of their examination, and reviewed
with them the annual audited financial statements and the opinions thereon. In addition,
through meetings with the Bank’s senior financiai officers, the Committee sought to ensure that
the Bank’s financial affairs were properly conducted.

The Committee is also charged with the
responsibility of satisfying itself that the Bank’s
operations evaluation and interna] audit are
adequate and efficient. It therefore reviewed the
work programs of the Operations Evaluation and
Internal Auditing Departments, the work in
progress, desirable standards, and procedures of
reporting. Through a subcommittee, it gave special attention to Project Performance Audit
Reports to determine how well the Operations
Evaluation Department carries out its assessment of individual projects. The Committee itself
reviewed and identified those giving rise to policy issues that may be considered by the Executive Directors. Through another subcommitee,

Executive Board 403

the Committee examined a number of Internal
Audit Reports to determine how well the Internal Auditing Department carries out its individual audits.

Of continuing concern to the Committee is the
adequacy of the flow of financial information to
the Executive Directors in order for the Board to
discharge its responsibilities properly with respect
to the financial policies of the Bank. Accordingly, the system for providing financial information to the Board is reviewed periodically by
the Committee.

The Committee provides a continuous channel through which the internal and external auditors can communicate with the Executive
Directors should the need arise, It meets as frequently as necessary, normally once a month. The
Committee consists of eight Executive Directors, who are appointed by the Board for a term
of two years after each regular election of Executive Directors. Since January 1983, Reinhard
Miinzberg has served as chairman of the Committee.

The Committee on Staff Compensation Issues
was established in July 1980. Its terms of reference mandate it to keep under continuing review
and, where appropriate, to advise the Executive
Directors on questions of staff compensation
policy and to maintain close liaison on all such
matters with the Executive Directors of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), bearing in
mind the need for general parallelism between the
two institutions.

Since its inception, the Committee has
addressed a wide range of topics. These include:
issues arising from a review of expatriate benefits; modifications in the Financia] Assistance
Program; a revised version of Principles of Staff
Employment to be adopted by the Executive
Directors, as well as draft rules implementing
them on sensitive issues such as separation and
demotion; options for the 1983 “intervening year”
salary review; the approach to the forthcoming
1984 major compensation review; and issues
arising from a joint Bank-IMF review of their
pension plans.

The Committee, which meets as frequently as
necessary, consists of eight Executive Directors,
who are appointed by the Executive Directors for
aterm of two years after each regular election of
Executive Directors. Since December 1982.
Bruno de Maulde has served as chairman of the
Committee.104

General Notes to Annex Tables

The tables of this Annex present data on selected
economic indicators and external public debt. As in past
Annual Reports, most of the tables are organized on
geographic lines.

In Table 1, the basic series on selected economic
indicators is based on data stored in the IBRD Socioeconomic Data Bank, which are mainly obtained from
World Bank country economic reports, supplemented by
data from national and other international publications. The indicators presented in this table are the same
as those of last year.

In Tables 2 through 7, the principal source of data on
external debt is information received by the World Bank
from its member countries, These data are checked with
and supplemented by information from several other
sources, primarily reporting by creditor countries on their
lending and publicized Eurocurrency credits. The notes
on the debt of Afghanistan, China, the Islamic Republic
of Iran, Iraq, the Philippines, and Yugoslavia in Table 2
apply to all Tables 2 through 7.

The ninety-eight countries included in the debt tables
are those for which reporting on external public debt is
sufficient for a reliable presentation of debt outstanding and future service payments. The classification by
geographical region is as follows:

Africa, south of the Sahara—Benin, Botswana,
Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad,
Comoros, Congo (People’s Republic of the), Djibouti, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia (The), Ghana,
Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Niger,
Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone,
Somalia, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo,
Uganda, Upper Volta, Zaire, Zambia, Zimbabwe
(and the East African Community).

East Asia and Pacific—iji, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Korea (Republic of), Malaysia, Papua New Guinea,
Philippines, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Thailand, Western Samoa.

latin America and the Caribbean—Argentina,
Bahamas, Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti,
Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama,
Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay,
Venezuela.

North Africa and Middle East—Algeria, Egypt (Arab
Republic of), Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman,
Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia, Yemen Arab
Republic, Yemen (People’s Democratic Republic of).

South Asia—Bangladesh, Burma, India, Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka.

Southern Europe and other Mediterranean countries—Cyprus, Greece, Israel, Malta, Portugal,
Turkey, Yugostavia.

For the purpose of these tables, external public debt
is defined as debt repayable to external creditors in foreign currency, goods, or services, with an original or
extended maturity of more than one year, which is a direct

Kingdom has accepted the Bank's Articles of Agreement.Statistical Annex __137

 

obligation of, or has repayment guaranteed by, a public
body in the borrowing country. Most military debts are
not reported, although a few countries have included such
obligations in their data.

The World Bank continues to work in cooperation with
its member countries toward the improvement of debt
statistics. This effort results in many cases in a broadening of the coverage of the data for both current and
past periods. Therefore, a comparison with the debt tables
in the 1982 Annual Report will show changes in data given
for past years. The current Annua/ Report should be
regarded as the more reliable. Users of the aggregate
tables on external public debt should be particularly
careful in making comparisons with past Annual Reports,
as the coverage has changed over the years.

in Table 4, debt-service ratios represent service payments (amortization plus interest) on external public debt
as a percentage of the exports of goods and all services.
The debt-service figures used in the present table are
those for actual (not contractual) debt service paid during the year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is
the source of export figures; the debt service ratios are
calculated for those countries and years for which these
data are available.

The debt-service ratio, by itself, is an inadequate and
incomplete indicator of the debt situation, and international comparisons of these ratios have only limited
analytical value. Many other factors, such as the stability and diversification of exports, the extent to which
imports can be reduced without adversely affecting the
prospects for future growth, the size of foreign exchange
reserves and available compensatory financing facilities, and the debt-service record jointly will determine a
country’s capacity to service debt. Further, external public
debt constitutes only a part of the total indebtedness and,
in some cases, it may understate substantially the burden of indebtedness. The public debt-service ratio,

therefore, is only an indicator of the importance of debt
service in the total foreign exchange situation.

In Table 6, net flow is defined as disbursements on
loans, grants, and grantlike loans, minus amortization
on loans. Net transfer is net flow, minus interest on loans.

In Table 7, grant element is defined as the face value
of a loan commitment less the discounted present value
of the future flow of payments of principal and interest,
expressed as a percentage of the face value. The discount rate used is 10 percent, the conventional rate used
by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) in assessing terms.

In Tables 6 and 7, the source of data for grants is the
OECD. For grantlike loans, the data sources are the OECD
and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Grants
consist of grant and grantlike (loans disbursed in foreign currency and repayable in local currency) contributions; they are on a disbursement basis in both tables.
The grants included in these tables comprise: (1) contributions by countries that are members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD; (2)
grants by multilateral agencies as compiled by the OECD;
(3) disbursements in foreign currency by the IDB on loans
repayable in local currencies. Grants for technical
assistance have been excluded. Data for grants do not
include grants from bilateral donors other than DAC
countries, although grants from other sources may have
been large in some cases. However, debt data include
obligations to creditors of all nationalities.

Data on external public debt are converted to U.S.
dollars at current market rates. Capital flows and service payments are converted to U.S. dollars at an average rate for each year. However, debts repayable in
multiple currencies, goods, or services, and debt that has
a provision for maintenance of value of the currency of
repayment, are shown at their book value. Projected debt
service was converted to U.S. dollars at end~1981 rates.138 __ Statistical Annex

Note: Debt service ratios are based on debt service actually paid and not on contractual service due. Information on the sources, definitions, coverage,
and interpretation of the data is giver in the “General Notes to Annex Tables.”

1 Because of special monetary arrangements peculiar to countries such as this, the debt service ratio must be regarded with more than usual caution

in considering the country's external financial situation.

2 Includes a notional share of debt service payments on loans to the East African Community: Kenya—50%; Tanzania—40%; and Uganda—10%.
3 Service payments for these years are affected strongly by preoayments.

Summary of Significant Accounting and
Related Policies

Translation of Currencies

The IBRD’s primary financial statements (Appendices A-G) are
expressed in terms of United States dollars. In addition, the IBRD
publishes financial statements expressed in terms of special drawing rights (SDRs) (Appendices A-G). The IBRD’s financial statements are expressed in terms of United States dollars or SDRs solely
for the purpose of summarizing the IBRD’s financial position and
the results of its operations for the convenience of its members and
other interested parties.

The IBRD is an international organization which conducts its operations in the currencies of all of its members. The IBRD's resources
are derived from its capital, borrowings and accumulated earnings
in the various currencies of its members and Switzerland and are
heid, invested or lent in those same currencies. The IBRD matches
its borrawing obligations in any one currency with assets in the same
currency, as prescribed by its Articles of Agreement, primarily by
holding, or lending the proceeds of its borrowings in the same currencies in which they are borrowed. Borrowed funds are sometimes
converted into other currencies and at the same time, forward
exchange contracts are entered intc in order to recover the currency
converted. With respect to its other resources, the IBRD does not
convert one currency into another except for small amounts required
to meet certain obligations and operational needs of the IBRD.

Assets and liabilities are translated at market rates of exchange to
the United States dollar. income and expenses are generally translated at an average of the market rates of exchange in effect during
each month. Translation adjustments, with the exception of those
relating tc capital subscriptions described in Note A, are charged or
credited to the General Reserve. In those few instances where curTencies are converted to another currency, the resulting gain or loss,
if any, is included in the determination of net income.

Investments

investment securities are recorded at cost or amortized cost. Gains
or losses on Sales cf investments, measured by the difference between
average cost and proceeds of sales, are recorded as an element of
income from investments.

Loans

Allof the IBRD’s loans are made to, or guaranteed by, members with
the exception of ioans to the International Finance Corporation. The
principal amounts of loans are repayable in the currencies lent. For
ioans negotiated since July 1980 (and for portions of certain earlier
loans), the repayment obligations of borrowers in various currencies are determined on the basis of a currency pooling system which
is designed to equalize exchange rate risks among borrowers. Interest on loans is accrued in the currencies lent.

The BRD has not suffered any losses on loan receivables and it has
a policy of not participating in moratoria or reschedulings. No losses
on loan receivables are anticipated and, accordingly, no reserve for
loan losses has been established; however, should such losses arise
they would be included in the determination of net income.

Capital Stock
From 1973 until March 31, 1978, the IBRD’s capital stock, which is

expressed in the IBRD’s Articles of Agreement in terms of “United
States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on July 1, 1944”
(1944 dollars), had been translated by the IBRD for purposes of its
financial statements into current United States doliars at the rate
of $1.20635 per 1944 collar. Since the effectiveness on Aprii 1, 1978,
of the Secand Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the international Monetary Fund (the Fund), currencies no longer have par
values in terms of gold. The IBRD is examining the implications of
this change on the valuation of its capital stock. No decisions on
this matter have been taken. However, for purposes of the financial
statements since June 30, 1978, the IBRD has expressed the value
of its capital stock on the basis of the SDR in terms of United States
dollars as computed by the Fund, $1.06835 per SDR on June 30, 1983
($1.09224 per SDR on June 30, 1982). (See Note A. This note also
shows what the value of the IBRD’s capital stock would have been
if expressed in terms of $1.20635 per 1944 dollar.) For the time being,
payments on account of subscriptions will continue to be accepted
at the equivalent of $120,635 per share of capital stock.

Administrative Expenses

A management fee is charged to the International Development
Association and a service and support fee to the International Finance
Corporation representing their respective shares of the administrative expenses of the IBRD.

Disposition of Income and General Reserve

The 'BRD has not declared or paid any dividends to its members.
Commencing in 1950, a portion or all of the accumulated net income
has been allocated to the General Reserve.

Since 1964, it has been the !BRD’s colicy to transfer to the Internationa! Develcament Association part of the year's income which
was not needed for allocation to reserves or otherwise required to be
retained in the IBRD's business and accordingly could nave been
prudently distributed as dividends. Such transfers are accounted for
as a charge to Accumulated Net Income—Unallocated

Note A—Capital Stock, Restricted
Currencies and Maintenance of Value

Capital Stock: In the Articles of Agreement, the capital stock of the
IBRD is expressed in terms of ‘United States dollars of the weight
and fineness in effect on July 1, 1944" (1944 dollars).

On April 30, 1976, the Board of Governors of the Fund approved proposed amendments to the Fund's Articles of Agreement (the Second
Amendment) which entered into force on Aprii 1, 1978. Under the
Second Amendment, currencies no longer have par values, gold is
abolished as @ common denominatcr of the monetary system and
all calculations for the gurposes of the Fund’s Articles are made on
the basis of the SDR. When the SDR was introduced into the Fund's
Articles in 1969, it was expressed in terms of a specified weight of
gold equal te the gold content of the 1944 dollar. Since July 1, 1974
the value of the SDR in terms of United States dollars has been based
on the weighted relative values of a number of major currencies (the
basket), inciuding the United States dollar. The value of the SDR on
July 1, 1974, expressed in terms of United States dollars, was
$1.20635, which was the equivalent of one 1944 dollar. On March
31, 1978, the Fund made certain changes in the basket of currencies effective july 1, 1978. On September 18, 1980, the Fund further
revised the basket, effective January 1, 1981, by reducing the

Notes to Financial StateMents. ccomnes

June 30, 1983 and June 30, 1982

 

number of currencies from 16 to five, and a method of further
adjustment at five-yearly intervals was established. These revisions have been, and are to be, done in a manner that ensures that
the value of the SDR in terms of any currency is the same immediately before and after the revision.

As a result of the Second Amendment and the simultaneous repea!
of Section 2 of the Par Value Modification Act (31 U.S.C. 449), the
provision of United States law defining the par value of the United
States dollar in terms of the SDR and gold, the pre-existing basis
for translating the term “United States dollar of the weight and
fineness in effect on July 1, 1944” into current United States dollars
or into any other currency no longer exists.

The Genera! Counsel of the IBRD has rendered a legai opinion concluding in substance that upon the entry into force of the Second
Amendment, references in the IBRO’s Articles of Agreement to the
1944 dollar should be read as referring to the SDR. as determined
from time to time by the Fund, and the mutual obligations of each
member and the IBRD, with respect to maintenar ce of vaiue of certain currency holdings, will be measured by the value of the currency in question in terms of the SDR at any given time.

The General Counsel has, however, also stated that in the exercise
of their statutory power under Article IX of the IBRD’s Articles, the
Executive Directors could conclude that the 1944 dollar would be
taken to mean 1.20635 current dollars, with the consequence that
maintenance of value would be measured by that standard.

A member government has raised the question whether the substitution of a new unit of value, insofar as it would give rise to any new
obligations with respect to maintenance of value and capita! stock
subscription payments, should be made only by amendment of the
Articles. it has also raised questions as to the desirability of retaining the principle of maintenance of value, the form in which it is
applied and the appropriateness of substituting @ unit of value other
than the SDR. Pending action on these questions, the financial
statements have been drawn up in accordance with the General
Counsel's opinion, that is, the value of the capital stock is expressed
in terms of the SDR.

The IBRD's capital comprised 716,500 (716.500—1982) authorized shares of the par value of SDR 100,000 each, of which 487,561
shares had been subscribed (395, 194-1982). Of the subscribed
capital, $4,719,439,000 ($4, 105,299,000—1982) has been cailed
and paid in and the remaining $47,369, 141.000 ($39,059,371,000—
1982) is subject to call only when required to meet the obligations
of the IBRD created by borrowing or guaranteeing loans. As to
$41,670,864,000 ($34,531,736,000—1982), the restriction on calls
is imposed by the Articles of Agreement and as to $5,698,277,000
($4,527,635,000—1982) by resolutions of the Board of Governors.

Restricted Currencies: The portion of capital subscriptions paid in
te the IBRD is divided into two parts: (1) $471,944,000
($410,530,000—1982) initially paid in gold or United States dollars, and (2) $4.247,495,000 ($3,694,769, 000—1982) paid in the
currencies of the respective members. Of this latter portion an amount
of $118,864,000 ($121,522,000-1982}) was subsequently converted by members into United States dollars, subject to the right of
the IBRD or the members to reverse the transactions, The amounts
paid in gold or United States dollars or subsequently converted by
members into United States dollars are freely usable by the IBRD in
any of its operations; however, the remaining amounts paid in the

currencies of the members, hereinafter called restricted currencies,
are usable by the IBRD in its lending operations only with the consent of the respective members. The equivalent of $2,286,456,000
($2,105,291,000—1982) has been used with such consent.

Maintenance of Value: Article ||, Section 9 of the Articles of Agreement provides for maintenance of value, as of the time of subscription, of such restricted currencies, requiring (1) the member to make
additional payments to the BRD in the event that the par value of
its currency is reduced or the foreign exchange vatue of its currency
has, in the opinion of the IBRD, depreciated to a significant extent
in its territories, and (2) the IBRD to reimburse the member in the
event that the par value of its currency is increased. Following the
establishment of central rates by several members in lieu of existing par values in March 1973, the Executive Directors decided that,
for all members that established central rates far their respective
currencies, pending the establishment of new par values, maintenance of value obligations be settled on the basis of those central!
tates. These obligations of the members and of the IBRD become
effective immediately upon the happening of those events with respect
to holdings of restricted currencies represented by currency balances and demand obligations. With respect to restricted currenCies out on loan, these cbligations become effective only as and when
such currencies are recovered by the IBRD, except that in several
cases the IBRD and the members concerned have agreed to make
provisional settiements of such obligations, by means of one er more
payments over periods not exceeding five years. At June 30, 1983,
SNii ($291, 000—1982) was receivable and $1,235,000
($1,444,000-—1982) was payable by the |BRD on such provisional
settlements. These amounts are included in Amounts Required to
Maintain Value of Currency Holdings under the headings Receivable on Account of Subscribed Capital and Liabilities, respectively.

Prior to April 1, 1978, where market rates of exchange were nat related
to par values or central rates, as in the cases of a majority of members, and where there were differences between market rates of
exchange and the rates at which capital subscriptions of members
had been paid or were payable, such differences were shown as
Translation Adjustments on Capital Subscriptions under the heading Other Assets. These amounts represented notional receivables
and payables which would become maintenance of value obligations if and when the provisions of Article li, Section 9 of the Articles
of Agreement or the decision of the Executive Directors described
above could be applied. According to the legal opinion of the IBRD’s
General Counsel referred to in this Note A under Capital Stock,
maintenance of value pursuant to Article i!, Section 9 of the Articles
of Agreement would be determined on the basis of the SDR, and is
treated in the financiai statements on this basis. Since the IBRD is
still considering the implications of the Second Amendment and in
view of the questions referred to above, the timing of any establishment and settlement of these notional maintenance of value items
$613,042,000 (§500,608,000—1982) receivable and $246,246,000
($174,502,000—1982) payable are uncertain. Accordingly, they are
included in Other Assets and Liabilities as notional maintenance of
value obligations.

Effect of Valuation in Terms of the SDR: Expressing the value of the
\BRD's capital stock in terms of the SDR rather than in terms of
$1.20635 does not have a material effect on the financial position
or results of the operations of the |BRD. If the vaiue of the capital
stock were expressed in terms of $1.20635, the subscribed capital
would have been $58,816,921,000 ($47,674,228,000—1982),Financial Statements 169

the uncalled portion of subscriptions $53,487,868,000
($43,140,035,000— 1982), the paid-in capital $5,329,053,000
($4,534, 193,000—1982) and the net maintenance of value obligations of the IBRD would have bean $893,259.000 ($694,689, 000—1982). Should the Executive Directors conclude that the capital would
be measured by some standard other than the SDR, any adjustment
of the amounts shown in the Balance Sheet as Notional Amounts
Required to Maintain Value of Currency Holdings would require 2
corresponding adjustment of the capital.

General Capital increase: On January 4, 1980, the IBRD’s Board of
Governors adopted a resolution (the General Capital Increase Resolution) which increases the authorized capital stock of the IBRD by
331,500 shares (subject to adjustment as described below); this
represents an increase of approximately $40,000,000,000. The General
Capital Increase Resolution authorizes subscriptions by members
to about 23% of these shares. The paid-in portion of the shares
authorized to be subscribed is 7.5%; subscribing members are
required to pay ¥4% of the subscription price in gold or United States
doilars and 634% in their respective currencies. Under the Articles,
each member is entitled to 250 membership votes plus ane vote for
each share subscribed. To avoid dilution of the voting power of certain members which would otherwise occur as this increase in capital is subscribed, the Board of Governors adopted another resolution
on January 4, 1980 which increases the authorized capital stock by
an additional 33,500 shares (representing a further increase of
approximately $4,000,0G0,000} and authorizes each member to
subscribe 250 shares of this additional capital, acne of which would
be paid in unless required to meet obligations of the IBRD for funds
borrowed or loans guaranteed by it. Of the shares authorized by these
resolutions, 154,715 had been subscribed as of June 30, 1983.

The General Capital Increase Resolution provides for a reduction of
the number of shares authorized by it if, as a result of determinations on the valuation of the IBRD’s capital stock, the 331.500 shares
authorized represent an increase in authorized capital in excess of
$40,000,000,000, calculated as of the time of such determinations
on the basis of the standard of value determined. in this case the
number of shares authorized by the General Capital Increase Resolution will be reduced so that their aggregate par value at that time
will be equivalent (to the nearest number of shares} to
$40,000,000,000, the number of shares authorized to be subscribed by each member will be correspondingly reduced, and
adjustments will be made on account of any shares already subscribed by members in excess of their reduced autherization.

Note B—Investments and Cash Collateral Invested

The market value of investment securities and invested cash collateral received on loaned securities was $16,812,858,000
($10,969,571,000—1982) compared with a cost or amortized cost
of $16,855,932,000 ($11,215, 162,000—1982), anda face value of
$16,990,862,000 ($11,345,509,000—1982), including investments not traded in the market which were valued at their cost of
$1,393,828,000 ($1,778,527,000-—1982). Obligations of the United
States Government and its instrumentalities having a cost or amortized cost of $292,538,000 ($292,537,000—1982) and a market
value of $290,814,000 ($262,949, 000—1982), set aside in respect
of the Speciai Reserve, as described in Note C, are included under
this heading.

The annualized rate of return on the average investments held during the period, based on the portfolio held at the end ot each month,
including realized gains and losses, was 12.15% (11.25% 1982).

Note C—Reserves and Net Income

The Managing Committee of the IBRD has proposed to the Executive
Directors that they approve the allocation of $552,001,000 to the
General Reserve out of the $752,001,000 net income earned in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1983 and that they recommend to the
Board of Governors that the balance of $200,000,000 be transferred by way of grant to the International Development Association

In August 1982, the IBRD allocated $472,652,000 to the General
Reserve out of the $597,652,000 net income earned in the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1982 and in September 1982, authorized the transfer of the balance of $125,000,000 by way of grant to the International Development Association.

In accordance with the policies discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies, the General Reserve has
decreased by $169,585,000 during the fiscal year ($244,798, 000—
1982); it has been charged with $191,288,000 ($278.740,000—
1982) representing net translation adjustments as a result of currency depreciations and appreciations and credited with $21,703,000
($33,942,000—1982) representing a compensating effect of the
appreciation of the United States dollar, in terms of the SDR, on the
portion of the |BRD's subscriptions paid in United States dollars and
in the currency of the subscribing member which was subsequently
released for lending in United States dollars. (See Statement of
Changes in General Reserve—Appendix B.) Since the value of the
SDR in terms of current dollars may vary from day to day, that portion of the IBRD's capital paid in or released in dollars will be subject to further adjustment at the end of each month

The Special Reserve consists of loan commissions set aside pursuant to Article IV, Section 6, of the Articles of Agreement which are
to be held in liquid assets and to be used only for the purpose of
meeting liabilities of the IBRD on its borrowings and guarantees,
The Special Reserve assets comprise obligations of the United States
Government and its instrumentalities and are included under the
heading |nvestments. As a result of a decision made in 1964, the
allocation of such commissions to the Special Reserve was discontinued in respect of subsequent ioans and no further additions are
being made to it.

Note D—Contributions to the International
Development Association

The IBRD has authorized transfers by way of grants to the international Development Association totaling $1,769,000,000 from net
income for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1964 through June 30,
1982. Of this amount, $847,339,000 was payable at June 30, 1983.
($1,44,000,000 had been authorized from net income through the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1981 and $747,339,000 was payable at
June 30, 1982.)

Note E—Staff Retirement Plan

The IBRD has a contributory retirement Plan for its staff, which also
covers the staff of the International Finance Corporation. The staff

contribute a fixed percentage of pensionable remuneration and the
IBRD contributes the remainder of the cost of funding the Plan. The
IBRD uses an aggregate funding method for determining its contribution. Such cost is funded as accrued. The cost of the Plan to the
IBRD for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1983 was $64,921,000
($59,331,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1982). All contributions io the Plan and all other assets and income held for the
purposes of the Plan are held by the IBRD separately from the other
assets and income of the BRD and Corporation and can be used
only for the benefit of the participants in the Plan and their beneficiaries until all liabilities to them have been discharged. The comparison of accumulated benefits and net assets of the Plan is

($24,021,000—1982) resulting from repurchases of obligations of
the IBRD prior to maturity pursuant to the terms of the respective
borrowing agreements, Interest on borrowings is net of income from
currency swaps of $126,678,000 ($32,803,000—1982). Administrative expenses are net of the management fee of $213,727,000
($193,375,000—1982) charged to the International Development
Association and of the service and support fee of $3,660,000
($3,844,000-—1982) charged to the International Finance Corporation. Contributions to special programs represent grants for agricultural research, the control of onchocerciasis and others which had
previously been funded from the IBRD’s transfers to the international Development Association.

At June 30, 1983, principal instalments of $40,000 and interest
and other charges of $1,309,000 payable to the ‘BRD on loans were
overdue by more than 60 days. The principal disbursed and outstanding on these loans amounted to $205.799,000. it is not anticipated that these delays will result in any loss to the IBRD.Financial Statements _174

In our opinion, the financial statements appearing in Appendices A through G present fairly, in terms
of United States dollars, the financial position of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development at June 30, 1983 and 1982, and the results of its operations and the changes in its financial position for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied. Our examinations of the statements were made in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such
other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

Summary of Significant Accounting and
Related Policies

Translation of Currencies

The IBRD’s primary financial statements (Appendices A-G) are
expressed in terms of United States dollars. In addition, the IBRD
publishes financial statements expressed in terms of special drawing rights (SDRs) (Appendices A~G). The IBRD’s financial statements are expressed in terms of United States dollars or SDRs solely
for the purpose of summarizing the IBRD’s financial position and
the results of its operations for the convenience of its members and
other interested parties.

The IBRO is an international organization which conducts its operations in the currencies of all of its members. The IBRD’s resources
are derived from its capital, borrawings and accumulated earnings
in the various currencies of its members and Switzerland and are
held, invested or lent in those same currencies. The IBRD matches
its borrowing obligations in any one currency with assets in the same
currency, as prescribed by its Articles of Agreement, primarily by
holding, or lending the proceeds of its borrowings in the same currencies in which they are borrowed. Borrowed funds are sometimes
converted into other currencies and at the same time, forward
exchange contracts are entered into in order to recover the currency
converted. With respect to its other resources, the IBRD does not
cenvert one currency into another except for small amounts required
to meet certain obligations and operational needs of the IBRD.

Assets and liabilities are translated at market rates of exchange to
the SDR. Income and expenses are generally translated at an average of the market rates of exchange in effect during each month.
Translation adjustments, with the exception of those relating to capital
subscriptions described in Note A, are charged or credited to the
General Reserve. in those few instances where currencies are converted to another currency, the resuiting gain or loss, if any, is included
in the determination of net income.

Investments

Investment securities are recorded at cost or amortized cost. Gains
or losses on sales of investments, measured by the difference between
average cost and proceeds of sales, are recorded as an element of
income from investments.

Loans

Ali of the IBRD’s loans are made to, or guaranteed by, members with
the exception of loans to the International Finance Corporation. The
principal amounts of loans are repayable in the currencies lent. For
foans negotiated since July 1980 (and for portions of certain earlier
loans), the repayment obligations of borrowers in various currencies are determined on the basis of a currency pooling system which
is designed to equalize exchange rate risk among borrowers. Interest on loans is accrued in the currencies lent.

The iBRD has not suffered any losses on ioan receivables and it has
a policy of not participating in meratoria or rescheduling. No losses
on loan receivables are anticipated and, accordingly, no reserve for
loan losses has been established; however, should such losses arise
they would be included in the determination of net income.

Capital Stock

The IBRD’s capital stock is expressed in the IBRD’s Articles of
Agreement in terms of “United States dollars of the weight and
fineness in effect on July 1, 1944’ (1944 dollars). Since the effectiveness on April 1, 1978, of the Second Amendment to the Articles
of Agreement of the international Monetary Fund (the Fund), currencies no longer have par vaiues in terms of gold. The !BRD is examining the implications of this change on the valuation of its capital
stock. No decisions on this matter have been taken. However, for
purposes of these financial statements, the IBRD has expressed the
value of its capital stock on the basis of the special drawing right
(SDR). (See Note A. This note also shows what the value of the IBRD’s
capital steck would have been if expressed in terms of US$1.20635
per 1944 dollar.) For the time being, payments on account of subscriptions will continue to be accepted at the equivalent of
US$120,635 per share of capital stock.

Administrative Expenses

A management fee is charged to the international Development
Association and a service and support fee to the International Finance
Corporation representing their respective shares of the administrative expenses of the IBRD.

Disposition of Income and General Reserve

The IBRD has not deciared or paid any dividends to its members.
Commencing in 1950, a portion or ail of the accumulated net income
has been aliccated to the General Reserve.

Since 1964, it has been the !BRD’s policy to transfer to the International Development Association part of the year's income which
was not needed for allocation to reserves or otherwise required to be
retained in the IBRD’s business and accordingly could have been
prudently distributed as dividends. Such transfers are accounted for
as a charge to Accumulated Net Income—Unallocated.

Note A—Capital Stock, Restricted Currencies and
Maintenance of Value

Capital Stock: In the Articles of Agreement, the capital stock of the
IBRD is expressed in terms of “United States dollars of the weight
and fineness in effect on July 1, 1944” (1944 dollars).

On April 30, 1976, the Board of Governors of the Fund approved proposed amendments to the Fund’s Articles of Agreement (the Second
Amendment) which entered into force on April 1, 1978. Under the
Second Amendment, currencies no longer have par values, gold is
abolished as a common denominator of the monetary system and
all calculations for the purposes of the Fund’s Articles are made on
the basis of the SDR. When the SDR was introduced into the Fund's
Articles in 1969, it was expressed in terms of @ specified weight of
gold equal to the gold content of the 1944 dollar. Since July 1, 1974,
the value of the SDR has been based on the weighted relative values of a number of major currencies (the basket). The value of the
SDR on July 1, 1974, expressed in terms of United States dollars,
was US$1.20635, which was the equivalent of one 1944 dollar. On
March 31, 1978, the Fund made certain changes in the basket of
currencies effective July 1, 1978. On September 18, 1980, the Fund
further revised the basket, effective January 1, 1981, by reducing
the number of currencies from 16 to five, and a method of further

(continued)486 IBRD Appendices

 

Notes To Financial STATEMENTS - écontiuee

adjustment at five-yearly intervals was established. These revisions have been, and are to be. done in a manner that ensures that
the vaiue of the SDR in terms of any currency is the same immediately before and after the revision.

As a result of the Second Amendment and the simultanecus repeal
of Section 2 of the Par Value Modification Act (31 U.S.C. 449), the
provision of United States law defining the par value of the United
States dollar in terms of the SDR and gold. the pre-existing basis
for translating the term “United States dollar of the weight and
fineness in effect on July 1, 1944” into any currency no longer exists.

The Genera! Counsel of the IBRD has rendered a legal opinion conciuding in substance that upon the entry into force of the Second
Amendment, references in the IBRD’s Articles of Agreement io the
1944 dollar should be read as referring to the SDR, as determined
from time to time by the Fund, and the mutual obligations of each
member and the IBRD, with respect to maintenance of value of certain currency holdings, will be measured by the value of the curtency in question in terms of the SDR at any given time.

The Genera! Counsel has. however, also stated that in the exercise
of their statutory power under Article IX of the IBRD’s Articles, the
Executive Directors could conclude that the 1944 dollar would be
taken to mean 1.20635 current US dollars, with the consequence
that maintenance of value would be measured by that standard.

A member government has raised the question whether the substitution of a new unit of value, insofar as it would give rise to any new
obligations with respect to maintenance of value and capital stock
subscription payments, should be made only by amendment of the
Articles. It has also raised questions as to the desirability of retaining the principle of maintenance of value, the form in which it is
applied and the appropriateness of substituting a unit of value other
than the SDR. Pending action on these questions, the financial
statements have been drawn up in accordance with the General
Counsel's opinion, that is. the value of the capital stock is expressed
in terms of the SDR.

The IBRD's capital comprised 716,500 (716,500—1982) authorized shares of the par value of SDR 100,000 each, of which 487,561
shares had been subscribed (395,194 1982). Of the subscribed
capital, SDR 4,417,502,000 (SDR 3,758.605,000—1982) has been
called and paid in and the remaining SDR 44,338,598,000
(SDR 35,760,795,000—1982) is subject to cail only when required
to meet the obligations of the IBRD created by borrowing or guaranteeing loans. As to SDR 39,004, 880,000 (SDR 31,615,520,000—
1982), the restriction on calls is imposed by the Articles of Agreement and as to SDR 5.333,718,000 (SDR 4,145,275,000--1982) by
resolutions of the Board of Governors.

Restricted Currencies: The portion of capital subscriptions paid in
to the IBRD is divided into two parts: (1) SDR 441,750,000
(SDR 375,860,000—1982) initially paid in gold or United States
dollars, and (2) SDR 3,975,752,000 (SDR 3,382,745,000—1982) paid
in the currencies of the respective members. Of this latter portion
an amount of SDR 111,259,000 (SDR 111.259,000—1982) was
subsequently converted by members into United States dollars, subject
to the right of the IBRD or the members to reverse the transactions,

The amounts paid in gold or United States cellars or subsequently
converted by members into United States dollars are freely usable
by the IBRD in any of its operations; however, the remaining amounts
paid in the currencies of the members, hereinafter called restricted
currencies, are usable by the IBRD in its lending operations oniy with
the consent of the respective members. The equivalent of
SDR 2,140,175,000 (SDR 1,927,499,000-—1982) has been used with
such consent.

Maintenance of Value: Article ||, Section 9 of the Articles of Agreement provides for maintenance of value. as of the time of subscription, of such restricted currencies, requiring (1) the member to make
additional payments to the IBRD in the event that the par value of
its currency is reduced or the foreign exchange vaiue of its currency
has, in the opinion of the IBRD, depreciated to a significant extent
in its territories, and (2) the IBRD to reimburse the member in the
event that the par value of its currency is increased. Following the
establishment of central rates by several members in lieu of existing par values in March 1973, the Executive Directors decided that,
for all members that established central rates for their respective
currencies, pending the establishment of new par values, maintenance of value obligations be settled on the basis of those central
tates. These obligations of the members and of the IBRD become
effective immediately upon the happening of those events with respect
to holdings of restricted currencies represented by currency balances and demand obligations. With respect to restricted currencies out on loan, these obligations become effective only as and when
such currencies are recovered by the IBRD, except that in several
cases the IBRD and the members concerned have agreed to make
provisional settlements of such obligations, by means of one or moze
payments over periods not exceeding five years. At June 30, 1983,
SDR Nil (SOR 266,000—1982) was receivable and SDR 1,156,000
(SDR 1,322,000—1982) was payable by the IBRD on such provisional settlements. These amounts are included in Amounts Required
to Maintain Value of Currency Holdings under the headings Receivable on Account of Subscribed Capital and Liabilities, respectively.

Prior to Apri! 1, 1978, where market rates of exchange were not related
to par values or central rates. as in the cases of a majority of members, and where there were differences between market rates of
exchange and the rates at which capita! subscriptions of members
had been paid or were payable, such differences were shown as
Translation Adjustments on Capital Subscriptions under the heading Other Assets. These amounts represented notional receivables
and payables which would become maintenance of value obligations if and when the provisions of Article tI, Section 9 of the Articles
of Agreement or the decision of the Executive Directors described
above could be applied. According to the lega! opinion of the IBRD's
General Counsel referred to in this Note A under Capital Stock,
maintenance of value pursuant to Article Il, Section 9 of the Articles
of Agreement would be determined on the basis of the SDR, and is
treated in the financial statements on this basis. Since the IBRD is
still considering the implications of the Secand Amendment and in
view of the questions referred to above, the timing of any establishment and settlement of these notional maintenance of value items
SBR 573,821,000 (SDR 458,332,000—1982) receivable and
SOR 230,492,000 (SOR 159,765,000-—1982) payable are uncertain. Accordingly, they are included in Other Assets and Liabilities
as notional maintenance of value obligationsFinancial Statements 187

Effect of Valuation in Terms of the SDR: Expressing the value of the
'BRD's capital stock in terms of the SDR rather than in terms of
US$1.20635 does not have a material effect on the financial position or results of the operations of the IBRD. If the value of the capital stock were expressed in terms of US$1.20635, the subscribed
capital would have Deen SDR $5,053,981,000 (SDR 43,648, 125,000—
1982), the uncalied portion of subscriptions SDR 50,065,866,000
(SDR 39,496,846,000—1982), the paid-in capita! SDR 4,988,115,000
(SDR 4,151,279,000—1982) and the net maintenance of value
obligations of the IBRD would have been SDR 836,111,000
{SDR 636,022,000—1982). Should the Executive Directors conclude that the capital would be measured by some standard other
than the SDR, any adjustment of the amounts shown in the Balance
Sheet as Notional Amounts Required to Maintain Value of Currency
Hoidings would require 2 corresponding adjustment of the capital.

General Capital Increase: On January 4, 1980, the |BRD's Board ot
Governors adopted a resolution (the General Capital Increase Resolution) which increases the authorized capital stock of the IBRD by
331,500 shares (subject to adjustment as described below); this
represents an increase of approximately SDR 33,150,000,000. The
General Capital increase Resolution authorizes subscriptions by
members to about 93% of these shares. The paid-in portion of the
shares authorized to be subscribed is 7.5%; subscribing members
are required to pay 34% of the subscription price in gold or United
States dollars and 63% in their respective currencies. Under the
Articles, each member is entitled to 250 membership votes pius one
vote for each share subscribed. Te avoid dilution of the voting power
of certain members which would otherwise occur as this increase in
capital is subscribed, the Board of Governors adopted another resolution on January 4, 1980 which increases the authorized capital
stock by an additional 33,500 shares (representing a further increase
of SDR 3,350,000,000) and authorizes each member to subscribe
250 shares of this additional capital, nane of which would be paid
in unless required to meet obligations of the IBRD for funds borrowed or loans guaranteed by it. Of the shares authorized by these
resolutions, 154,715 had been subscribed as of June 30, 1983.

The General Capital Increase Resolution provides tor a reduction of
the number of shares authorized by it if, as a result of determinations on the valuation of the IBRD’s capital stock, the 331,500 shares
authorized represent an increase in authorized capital in excess of
US$40,000,000,000, calculated as of the time of such determinations on the basis of the standard of value determined. In this case
the number of shares authorized by the General Capital Increase
Resolution will be reduced so that their aggregate par value at that
time will be equivalent (to the nearest number of shares) to
US$40,000,000,000, the number of shares authorized to be subscribed by each member will be correspondingly reduced, and
adjustments wil! be made on account of any shares already subscribed by members in excess of their reduced authorization.

Note B—Investments and Cash Collateral Invested

The market value of investment securities and invested cash callateral received on loaned securities was SDR 15,737,219,000
(SDR 10,043,187,000—1982) compared with a cost or amortized
cost of SDR 15,777,538,000 {SDR 10,268,038,000-—-1982), and a
face value of SDR 15,903,835,000 (SDR 10,387,377,000—1982),
including investments not traded in the market which were valued

at their cost of SDR 1,304,655,000 (SDR 1,628.330.000—1982}.
Obligations of the United States Government and its instrumentalities having a cost or amortized cost of SDR 273,822,000
(SDR 267,832,000-—1982) and a market value of SDR 272,209,000
(SDR 240,743,000—1982), set aside in respect of the Special
Reserve, as described in Note C. are included under this neading.

The annualized rate of return on the average investments held during the period, based on the portfolic held at the end of each month,
including realized gains and losses, was 12.15% (11.25% —1982).

Note C—Reserves and Net Income

The Managing Committee of the IBRD has proposed to the Executive
Directors that they approve the allocation of SDR 508,241,000 te the
General Reserve out of the SDR 692,389,000 net income earned in
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1983 and that they recommend to the
Board of Governors that the balance of SDR 184. 148.000 be transferred by way of grant to the International Development Association.

In August 1982, the IBRD allocated SDR 412,337.000 to the General
Reserve out of the SDR 521,385,000 net income earned in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1982 and in September 1982, authorized the
transfer of the balance of SDR 109,048,000 by way of grant to the
International Development Association

In accordance with the policies discussed in the Summary of
Significant Accounting and Related Policies, the General Reserve has
decreased by SDR 84,993,000 during the fiscal year
{SDR 63,068,000—1982); it has been charged with SDR 104,134,000
(SDR 89,973,000-—1982) representing net translation adjustments as @ result of currency depreciations and appreciations and
credited with SDR 19,141,000 (SDR 26,905,000—1982) representing a compensating effect of the appreciation of the United States
dollar. in terms of the SDR, on the portion of the IBRD’s subscriptions paid in United States dollars and in the currency of the subscribing member which was subsequently reigased for lending in
United States daliars. (See Statement of Changes in Gereral
Reserve—Appendix B.) Since the value of the SDR in terms of curTent dollars may vary from day to day, that portion of the IBRD’s capital
paid in or released in dollars will be subject to further adjustment
at the end of each month.

The Special Reserve consists of loan commissions set aside pursuant to Article IV, Section 6, of the Articles of Agreement which are
to be held in jiquid assets and to be used only for the purpose of
meeting liabilities of the (BRD on its borrowings and guarantees
The Special Reserve assets comprise obligations of the United States
Government and its instrumentalities and are included under the
heading Investments. As a result of a decision made in 1964. the
allocation of such commissions te the Special Reserve was discontinued in respect of subsequent loans and no further additions are
being made to it.

1982. Of this amount SDR 793,129,000 was payable at June 30, 1983.
(SDR 1,478,221,000 has been authorized from net income through
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1981 and SDR 684,226,000 was payable at June 30, 1982.)

Note E—Staff Retirement Plan

The IBRD has a contributory retirement Plan for its staff, which also
covers the staff of the international Finance Corporation. The staff
contribute a fixed percentage of pensionable remuneration and the
IBRD contributes the remainder of the cost of funding the Plan. The
IBRD uses an aggregate funding methed for determining its contribution. Such cost is funded as accrued. The cost of the Plan ta the
IBRD for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1983 was SDR 59,935,000
(SDR 52,185,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1982). All contributions to the Plan and all other assets and income held for the
purposes of the Plan are held by the IBRD separately from the other
assets and income of the IBRD and Corporation and can be used
only for the benefit of the participants in the Plan and their beneficiaries until all liabilities to them have been discharged. The comparison cf accumulated benefits and net assets of the Plan is
presented below:

Note F—Income and Expenses

Income from investments includes net gains ot SDR 160,344,000
(net losses of SDR 91,049,000—1982) resulting from sales of
investments. Other income includes net gains of SDR 14,988,000
(SDR 21,096,00—1982) resulting fram repurchases of obligations of the IBRD prior to maturity pursuant to the terms of the
respective borrowing agreements. Interest on borrowings is net of
income from currency swaps of SDR 117,018,000 (SDR 28,938,000—
1982}. Administrative expenses are net of the management fee of
SDR 197,317,000 (SDR 169,862,000-—1982) charged to the International Development Association and of the service and support
fee of SDR 3,379,000 (SDR 3,381,000-—1982) charged to the International Finance Corporation.

At June 30, 1983, principal instalments of SDR 38,000 and interest
and other charges of SDR 1,225,000 payabie to the IBRD on loans
were overdue by more than 60 days. The principal disbursed and
outstanding on these loans amounted to SDR 192,633,060. It is not
anticipated that these delays will result in any lass to the IBRD.Financial Statements _189

President and Board of Governors,
International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development

In our opinion, the financial statements appearing in Appendices A through G present fairly, in terms
of special drawing rights (SDRs), the financial position of the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development at June 30, 1983 and 1982, and the results of its operations and the changes in its
financial position for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied. Our examinations of these statements were made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and
such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

+ On August 9, 1979, the Executive Directors decided that the Association’s commitment authority not be reduced by the amount of deficits in fiscal
year 1980 or during the period of the sixth replenishment of the Association’s resources. In order to reflect this decision, the resources available for
commitment have been increased by the amount of the accumulated loss for the period July 1, 1979 to June 30, 1983.

7 includes sixteen development credits totaling $515,906,000 approved by the Association subject to the availability of additional commitment authority. At June 30, 1983 the amount of $515,210,000 of additional commitment authority has become available but has not been ailocated to specific
development credits; as a result, the aggregate amount of development credits subject to availability of commitment authority has decreased to
$696,000. The difference of $1,140,519,000 between this amount and $1,141,215,000 is primarily attributable to exchange rate fluctuations in the
value, in terms of current United States dollars, of resources expressed in other member currencies and provided in prior fiscal years. The value of
these resources at any given time may be greater or less than the development credits committed against them, since these development credits are
denominated in United States dollars or special drawing rights. If a shortfall should make it necessary, repayments on earlier development credits
would be available for meeting the Association's disbursement obligations. Resources provided under the sixth replenishment may also be used for
this purpose, if necessary.(panurjuoa)

Summary of Significant Accounting and
Related Policies

Translation of Currencies

The Association is an international organization which conducts its
operations in the currencies of all of its members and Switzerland.
The Association's policy is to translate its assets and liabilities in
currencies other than United States dollars at market rates of
exchange to the United States dollar at the end of each quarter.
Translation adjustments relating to subscriptions and supplementary resources are accounted for as described in Note C; all other
translation adjustments are included in the determination of net
income. Income and expenses are translated at an average of the
market rates of exchange in effect during each quarter.

The subscriptions and supplementary resources provided through
the third replenishment are expressed in terms of “United States
dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on January 1, 1960” (1960
dollars) and from 1973 until March 31, 1978 have been translated
by the Association, for purposes of the financial statements, into
current United States dollars at the rate of $1.20635 per 1960 dollar. The subscriptions and supplementary resources provided under
the fourth and fifth replenishments are expressed and payable in
members’ currencies. The supplementary resources provided under
the sixth replenishment and the FY84 Account are expressed in
members’ currencies or special drawing rights (SDRs) and are payable in members’ currencies. Subscriptions and supplementary
resources provided subsequent to the third replenishment are
translated (1) at market rates of exchange at the end of each quarter
for amounts receivable and for amounts received and not yet disbursed, and (2) at market rates of exchange on the dates of disbursement in respect of those amounts which have been disbursed
or converted into another currency.

The Association's development credits funded from resources provided through the fifth replenishment are denominated in current
United States doilars; the principal amounts disbursed on such credits
are repayable in amourts equivalent to the value of the currencies
disbursed in terms of 1960 dollars. Development credits approved
by the Executive Directors of the Association after August 1, 1980,
funded from resources provided under the sixth replenishment, are
denominated in SDRs; the principal amounts disbursed under such
credits are to be repaid in amounts equivalent to the value of the
currencies disbursed in terms of SDRs.

On April 30, 1976, the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund (the Fund) approved proposed amendments to the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement (the Second Amendment) which entered into
force on Aoril 1, 1978. Under the Second Amendment, currencies no
longer have par vaiues, gold is abolished as a common denominator of the monetary system and all calculations for the purposes of
the Fund’s Articles are made on the basis of the SDR.

As a resuit of the Second Amendment and the simultaneous repeal
of Section 2 of the Par Value Modification Act (31 U.S.C. 449), the
provision of United States law defining the par value of the United
States dollar in terms of the SDR and gold, the pre-existing basis
for translating the term “United States dollar of the weight and
fineness in effect on January 1, 1960” into current United States
dollars or into any other currency, no longer exists.

The General Counsel of the Association has rendered a legal opinion
concluding in substance that upon entry into force of the Second
Amendment references in the Association's Articles of Agreement to
the 1960 dollar should be read as referring to the SDR, as determined from time to time by the Fund and the mutual obligations of

each member and the Association with respect to maintenance of
value of certain currency holdings will be measured by the value of
the currency in question in terms of the SDR at any given time. It
would be consistent with this opinion also to substitute the SDR for
the 1960 dollar as the measure of the development credit repayment obligation expressed in terms of 1960 dollars, but this would
fequire approval of the Executive Directors and would involve other
changes in the development credit agreements.

The General Counsel has, however, also stated that in the exercise
of their statutory power under Article X of the Association's Articles,
the Executive Directors could conclude that the 1960 dollar would
‘be taken to mean $1.20635 current dollars, with the consequence
that maintenance of value would be measured by that standard.

Pending action on this matter by the Association, the subscriptions
and supplementary resources through the third replenishment have
been expressed in SDRs on the basis that one SDR equals one 1960
dollar. (However, as described in the following paragraph, this basis
has not been applied to development credit repayment obligations
expressed in terms of 1960 dollars.) The value of such subscriptions and supplementary resources has been expressed on the basis
of the SDR in terms of United States dollars as computed by the Fund
($1.06835 per SDR) on June 30, 1983, for the amounts of subscriptions and supplementary resources undisbursed at June 30, 1983,
at the daily SOR rate for amounts disbursed fram the effective date
of the Second Amendment to June 30, 1983, and at the rate of
$1.20635 per 1960 dollar for amounts disbursed prior to the effective date of the Second Amendment. Expressing the value of certain
of the Association’s subscriptions and supplementary resources in
terms of the SDR rather than in terms of the 1960 dollar (translated
at the rate of $1.20635) does not have a material effect on the
financial position or results of operations of the Association. If the
value of these subscriptions and supplementary resources were
expressed in terms of $1.20635 the amount of $26,171,537,000
($23,798,985,000—1982) shown in the Statement of Condition would
have increased by $16,770,000 to $26, 188,307,000 ($11,232,000
to $23,810,217,000—1982).

Pending ciarification of the effect of the Second Amendment on
development credit repayment obligations exoressed in 1960 dolJars, the Association has continued to base these upon the par value
($1.20635 per 1960 dollar) in effect immediately prior to effectiveness of the Second Amendment. If the matter had been resolved during
the period ended June 30, 1983, and the Association had expressed
such repayment obligations in terms of the SDR at June 30, 1983,
the amount of $17,368,395,000 ($14,876,634,000—1982) shown
in the Statement of Condition would have decreased by
$1,779,283,000 ($1,474,455,000—1982) as of June 30,1983 representing the cumulative effect of the change since April 1, 1978.
This would have resulted in a net loss for the period ended June 30,
1983 of $1,869,928,000 ($1,556,662,000—1982) rather than a net
loss of $90,645,000 ($82,207,000—1982).

Investments

Investment securities are recorded at cost or amortized cost. Gains
or losses on sales of investments, measured by the difference between
average cost and proceeds of sales, are recorded as an element of
income from investments.

Development Credits

All of the Association’s development credits are made to member
governments or to the government of a territory of a member (except
for three development credits which have been made to regional
development banks for the benefit of members or territories ofFinancial Statements _ 205

Appendix F

International Development
Association

 

members of the Association). The Association has not suffered any
losses on development credit receivables and no losses are antici~
pated. However, should such losses arise they would be included in
the determination of net income.

Administrative Expenses

Administrative expenses of the Association are paid by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the IBRD). The
Association reimburses the IBRD for such expenses by payment of a
management fee representing its share of the administrative expenses
incurred by the IBRD.

Note A—Restricted Currencies

The membership of the Association is divided into two categories:
(1) Part | members, which pay all subscriptions and supplementary
resources provided to the Association in convertible currencies which
may be freely used or exchanged by the Association in its operations; (2) Part Il members, which pay ten percent of their initial subscriptions in freely convertible currencies and the remaining ninety
percent of their initial subscriptions and al! additional subscriptions and any supplementary resources provided to the Association
in their own currencies. The Articles of Agreement of the Association
and subsequent replenishment agreements provide that the currency of any Part Il member paid in by it may not be used by the
Association for projects financed by the Association and located
outside the territories of the member except by agreement between
the member and the Association. The amounts of $52,223,000
($55,061,000—1982) under the heading Due from Banks,
$75,662,000 ($89,042,000—1982) included under the heading
Receivable on Account of Subscriptions and Supplementary Resources
and $74,139,000 ($71,331,000—1982) included in Notional Amounts
Required to Maintain Value of Currency Holdings under the headings Other Assets and Other Liabilities respectively, were subject to
such restrictions.

Note B—Investments and Cash Collateral Invested

The market value of investment securities and cash collateral invested
was $63,408,000 ($158,018,000—1982) compared with a cost or
amortized cost of $63,110,000 ($160,311,000—1982) and face value
of $64,612,000 ($163, 733,000—1982), including investments not
traded in the market which were valued at their cost of $30,546,000
($41,604,000—1982). Investments include securities purchased
under agreements to resell amounting to $4,633,000 ($6,404,000—
1982).

Note C—Maintenance of Value

Article IV, Section 2 of the Association's Articles of Agreement provides for the maintenance of the value, as of the time of subscription, of the Association's currency holdings or demand obligations
substituted therefor representing ninety percent of each member's
initial subscription, only so long as and to the extent that such currency has not been initially disbursed or exchanged for the currency
of another member. This Section requires: (1) the member to make
additional payments to the Association in the event that the par value
of its currency is reduced or the foreign exchange value of its curtency has, in the opinion of the Association, depreciated to a significant extent in its territories and (2) the Association to reimburse
‘the member in the event that the par value of its currency is increased
or the foreign exchange value of its currency has, in the opinion of
the Association, appreciated to a significant extent in its territories.

 

The provisions of Article IV, Section 2 have by agreement been extended
to cover additional subscriptions and supplementary resources of
the Association through the third replenishment but are not applicable to those of the fourth, fifth and sixth replenishments. On June 19,
1972, the Executive Directors decided that for all members that
established central rates for their respective currencies, pending
establishment of new par values for their currencies, maintenance
of value obligations be settled on the basis of those central rates. It
was further decided that with respect to any member currency functioning under a system under which the market rate was not confined within announced intervention margins, maintenance of value
obligations would be determined on the basis of market rates in effect
on the respective dates of disbursement of such currency, but only
for the amounts disbursed.

Prior to April 1, 1978, where market rates of exchange were not related
to par values or central rates as in the cases of a majority of the
members, and there were differences between market rates of
exchange and the rates at which undisbursed subscriptions and
supplementary resources of members through the third replenishment of the Association's resources had been paid or were payable,
such differences were shown as Translation Adjustments on Subscriptions and Supplementary Resources under the heading Other
Assets. The amounts $87,993,000 ($85,701,000—1982) established at that date and accordingly at June 30, 1983 represented
notional receivables $117,811,000 ($111,914,000—1982) and
payables $29,818,000 ($26,213,000—1982). Maintenance of value
obligations in respect of such undisbursed amounts are determined
upon their disbursement. In accordance with the legal opinion of the
Association's General Counsel referred to above, maintenance of value
pursuant to Article 1V, Section 2 of the Articles of Agreement is being
determined provisionally on the basis of the SDR, and is treated in
the financial statements on that basis. Since the Association is still
considering the implications of the Second Amendment, and in view
of the questions referred to above, the timing of any establishment
and settlement of these notional maintenance of value items is
uncertain. Accordingly, they are included in Other Assets, and Lia~
bilities as notional maintenance of value obligations.

Note D—Contribution by Switzerland

The Swiss Confederation, which is not a member of the Association,
has made grant contributions to the Association in the amount of
SwF 181,480,000. This amount represents the outstanding balances of loans to the Association totaling SwF 182,000,000, made
by the Confederation in fiscal years 1967 and 1973. These outstanding balances were converted into grant contributions pursuant to agreements between the Confederation and the Association
which came into force on April 1, 1981. As a result of the conversion, the Accumulated Net Loss was reduced by $43,604,000 representing the difference between the value of the loans at the times
the loans were drawn down and their value at the time of conversion
into grant contributions. These agreements make provision for converting these grant contributions into a subscription or supplementary resources if Switzerland should become a member of the
Association.

Note E—Subscriptions and Supplementary Resources

Subscriptions and supplementary resources have been translated
as set forth under the Summary of Significant Accounting and Related
Policies. At June 30, 1983 and 1982 these were as follows:

*Represents the portion of the United States contribution which is
qualified as described below.

The sixth replenishment of the Association's resources authorized
by Resolution of the Board of Governors totals the equivalent of
$12,000,000,000, computed on the basis of representative rates of
exchange and the SDR value of currencies on October 5, 1979. The
replenishment became effective on August 24, 1981. At that date,
notifications had been received from 24 members, of which 16 were
Part | members {including the United States, as mentioned in the
following paragraph). that they would contribute to the sixth
replenishment the equivalent of $9,946,860,000. Subsequent to
August 24, 1981 but prior to June 30, 1983 further notifications of
contributions in the equivalent of $1,905,200,000 were received
increasing the total notifications of contributions to the equivalent
of $11,852,060,000. Pursuant to the resolution, contributions are

payable in three equal annual instalments unless contributing
members notify the Association that they wish to avail themselves
of certain options providing for a different schedule of payment.

In connection with its participation in the sixth replenishment, the
United States notified the Association that it would pay the amount
of $500,000,000 and that, subject to obtaining the necessary
appropriations, it would pay the remaining $2,740,000,000. The
notification by the United States was thus qualified with respect to
$2,740,000,000 of its contribution. Subsequently, the United States
paid $1,400,000,000 of this amount, leaving $1,340,000,000 subject to said qualification; this brought its sayments to 58.64 percent of its total contribution of $3,240.000,000. The resolution
provides that, for purposes of credit commitments by the Association, all the subscriptions and contributions authorized thereunder
shall be divided into three successive tranches of at least 29 percent, at least 33 percent and 38 percent (or the remaining balance)
of the total. If and as long as unqualified contribution commitments have not been received from the United States for the respective minimum amount of any said tranches of its subscription and
contribution, the amount of such tranche of ail subscriptions and
contributions which the Association may use under the Resolution
for making new unqualified credit commitments will be reduced in
proportion to such shortfall in unqualified contribution commitments. However, a number of governments have waived this provision and released additional amounts of their contributions for
commitment by the Association. At June 30, 1983 the amount of
subscriptions and contributions available for commitment on the
basis of the resolution or such waivers totaled the equivalent ofFinancial Statements __207

Appendix F

Association

 

$7,972,188,000 and the remaining balance in the equivalent of
$1,933,483,000 was subject to the above-mentioned restrictions.

On October 26, 1982, the Association’s Executive Directors approved
arrangements for special contributions by its members pending a
further general replenishment of the Association's resources. These
arrangements provide for members’ contributions to be made either
toa “FY84 Account” or to a ‘Special Fund”. While the special contributions to the F¥84 Account are additions to the regular resources
of the Association, the special contributions to the Special Fund, which
is administered by the Association, are kept separate and apart from
all other accounts of the Association. Contributions to the FY84
Account and the Special Fund are in the aggregate expected to amount
to the equivalent of about $2 billion, computed on the basis of rates
of exchange on August 31, 1982. At these rates of exchange, as of
June 30, 1983, a notification of contribution to the FY84 Account
equivalent of $530,000 and a contribution to the Special Fund
equivalent of $44,693,000 had been received.

Note F—Transfers from International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development

The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has
authorized transfers by way of grants to the Association totaling
$1,769,000,000 ($1,644,000,000—1982) from net income of the
(BRD for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1964 through June 30, 1982.
Of this amount, $79,905,000 ($79,905,000—1982) may be used by
the Association or had been disbursed for grants for agricultural
research and for the control of onchocerciasis.

Note G—Translation Adjustments

In accordance with the policies discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies the Association has recorded
a charge of $22,066,000 ($17,014,000—1982) representing
translation adjustments. This amount comprises a charge of $840,000
($1,701,000—1982) as a result of currency depreciations and
appreciations, a credit of $59,000 ($77,000—1982) representing
the effect of the valuation change to the SDR on that portion of the
Association’s subscriptions and supplementary resources paid in
United States dollars and a charge of $21,285,000 ($15,390,000
1982) representing the adjustment of development credit repayment obligations expressed in SDRs.

Since the value of the SDR in terms of current dollars may vary from
day to day, the portion of the Association's subscriptions and supplementary resources paid in dollars will be subject to further
adjustment at the end of each quarter.

Note H—Net Loss

The Association pays a management fee to the IBRD in respect of
administrative expenditures incurred for projects during their preparation and implementation. To cover its administrative costs, the
Association levies a service charge of three-fourths of one percent
per annum on the disbursed and outstanding portions of its development credits and, since January 5, 1982, a commitment charge
of one-half of one percent per annum on the undisbursed portions
of development credits negotiated after that date. The Association
incurs a temporary income deficit with respect to each development
credit because administrative expenses are incurred before substantial amounts of the credit are disbursed and service charges
eared thereon; the new commitment charge was introduced to reduce
such deficits. The present value of earnings from development credits
to be approved during the current fiscal year, as estimated by the
Association, is expected to exceed the management fee for that year.
The amount of the income deficit which may be incurred in any year
will be influenced by a number of factors including the scale of lending
activities of the Association, the amount of credits on which charges
are being earned and the income from other investments the Association may have.

At June 30, 1983, principal instalments of $313,000 and service
charges of $1,036,000 payable to the Association on development
credits were overdue by more than 60 days. The principal disbursed
and outstanding on these development credits amounted to
$95,743,000. Of these amounts $313,000 of principal and $883,000
of service charges were due from Chad in respect of development
credits on which principal disbursed and outstanding amounted to
$36,238,000. The arrears of Chad’s service payments date from
December 1979. itis not anticipated that these delays in payments,
including those due fram Chad, will result in any loss to the Association.208 IDA Appendices

President and Board of Governors,
International Development Association

We have examined the financial statements of the International Development Association appearing
in Appendices A through F. Our examinations of these statements were made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and
such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

As described in the Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies in the notes to these financial
statements, management believes that it would be consistent with General Counsel’s opinion with respect
to the valuation of certain of the Association’s subscriptions and supplementary resources, to also substitute the special drawing right (SDR) for the 1960 dollar as the measure of the development credit
repayment obligations of the Association’s borrowers. However, this would require approval of the
Executive Directors and involve other changes in the development credit agreements. Accordingly,
until these events have occurred, the repayment obligations will not be revalued.

In our opinion, subject to the effects on the financial statements of such adjustments, if any, as might
have been required had the outcome of the uncertainty referred to in the preceding paragraph been
known, the financial statements examined by us present fairly, in terms of United States dollars, the
financial position of the International Development Association at June 30, 1983 and 1982, the results
of its operations and the changes in its resources available for commitment for the years then ended in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied.

Summary of Significant Accounting and

Organization and Operations

On October 26, 1982, the International Development Association (IDA)
established a Special Fund (the Special Fund) constituted by funds
to be contributed by members of IDA and administered by DA, for
supplementing the regular resources available for lending by IDA.
The arrangements governing the Special Fund may be amended or
terminated by IDA’s Executive Directors subject to the agreement of
a qualified majority of the contributors to the Special Fund. The
resources of the Special Fund are kept separate from the resources
of IDA. The Special Fund became effective on December 13, 1982.

At June 30, 1983, the International Development Association had
received formal statements of intent for contributions from the following members in the amounts indicated:

  

Canada $163;448,000 SDR 152,991,000
Denmark 27,109,000 25,375,000
France 116,661,000 109,197,000

Norway . . 41,124,000 38,493,000
Sweden 65,303,000 61,125,000

Totals... 2... $497,005,000 SDR 465,208,000

Translation of Currencies

Assets and undisbursed contributions are translated at market rates
of exchange to the United States dollar and the special drawing right
(SDR) at the end of each quarter. Disbursed contributions are

translated at market rates of exchange effective on the dates of
disbursement.

Special Fund Credits

Special Fund credits are denominated in SDRs; the principal amounts
disbursed under such credits are to be repaid in amounts equivalent to the value of currencies disbursed in terms of SDRs.

Special Fund credits are made on the same terms as regular IDA
credits except that the proceeds of Special Fund credits may be used
only to finance expenditures for goods or services from (a) Part II
members of IDA; (b) Part | members contributing to the Special Fund;
and {c) Part | members contributing to the regular resources of IDA
through IDA’s FY84 Account who have notified IDA that such contributions are to be treated in the same manner as contributions to
the Special Fund for purposes of any future adjustment of the voting rights of the members of IDA.

Service and Commitment Charges

The service and commitment charges payabie by borrowers under
Special Fund credits are to be paid directly to IDA, and retained by
IDA to compensate it for its services as Administrator of the Special
Fund.

Investment Income

Any income from investment of funds held in the Special Fund shall
become part of the resources of the Special Fund.

Principal Repayments

The principal repayments on Special Fund credits shall become part
of the general resources of IDA, unless otherwise provided in a decision of IDA's Executive Directors to terminate administration of the
Special Fund by IDA.212 IDA Appendices

President and Board of Governors,
Special Fund Administered by the
International Development Association

In our opinion, the financial statements appearing in Appendices A through E present fairly, in terms
of United States dollars, and special drawing rights (SDRs), the financial position of the Special Fund
Administered by the International Development Association at June 30, 1983, and the results of its
operations and the changes in its resources available for commitment for the period from December 13,
1982 (date of inception) to June 30, 1983, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Our examination of these statements was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

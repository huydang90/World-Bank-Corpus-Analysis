International Poverty Lines and the 2008 Annual Report

Poverty estimates in this report use international poverty lines that are based on 1993 purchasing power parity (PPP] conversion factors. This was the
latest measure at press time. As of August 2008, the World Bank was in the process of revising poverty estimates using more recent PPP conversion
factors that are based on the 2005 round of the International Comparison Program.

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2008 1MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD BANK
AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

2008 has been an important year for the World Bank Group.
lam pleased to introduce an Annual Report that captures the
progress we have made so far and the work ahead of us.

This year, we have developed six strategic priorities to
focus our effort.

We are giving particular attention to the poorest countries,
especially in Africa. Bringing opportunity and growth to these
countries means quality education, especially for girls;
addressing disease, malnutrition, and clean water; and many
other social development topics. It involves a growth agenda:
infrastructure, energy, regional integration linked to global
markets, and a healthy private sector. This past year, we
achieved a record-setting IDA15 of $41.7 billion, representing
a 30 percent increase over IDA14. We launched an initiative to
link Sovereign Wealth Funds with equity investment in Africa,
to help sub-Saharan Africa reach its potential as another pole
of growth for the global economy.

The Bank Group is focused on development in states in
fragile situations or affected by conflict—the modern version
of the challenge the Bank faced after World War II, when the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
helped reconstruct Europe and Japan. Today, we are trying
to help Liberia, Afghanistan, Haiti, Kosovo, and others.

We are addressing the challenges of Middle Income
Countries. This year, we achieved the first reduction in loan
prices in over a decade, along with simplification of processes, extension of maturities, and improved access to risk
management tools. We are developing a host of knowledge
and financial services to help these important clients, and
working with them as they expand their activities in other
countries, so as to broaden and diversify the stakeholders
in the international economic system.

The Bank is increasing work on global public goods, from
HIV/AIDs, avian influenza, malaria, TB, and health systems to
pull this work together, to the challenges of global climate
change, both adaptation and mitigation. We launched the
Forest Carbon Partnership Facility and Carbon Partnership
Facility, and the Board approved our new Climate Investment
Funds. Those initiatives will help developing countries test
new approaches and pursue lower-carbon growth paths.

In the Arab World, even those countries that are rich in
resources are facing demographic challenges, and they will
need to find ways to generate jobs, broaden their growth, and
create hope. We have been advancing areas of cooperation,
including Islamic finance, water, and education.

We are also forming new partnerships, gaining knowledge
and valuable experience, and leveraging the best global
knowledge to support development. This involves focusing on
serving our clients and ensuring that we are devoting attention

2 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2008

 

to solving problems, not just analyzing them. This may be our
most vital task, and we have much work ahead of us.

The Bank Group has been especially focused on responding to high food and energy prices. We are working with the
UN and other international partners to identify particularly
vulnerable countries requiring immediate assistance. The
Bank Group created a $1.2 billion Global Food Crisis Response
Program to respond quickly to the needs of our clients, and we
are assisting countries to increase production and productivity
across the agricultural value chain, to transform today’s food
problem into a growth opportunity. The Bank Group is also
working to address short-term needs, and scaling up public
and private sector projects that enhance sustainable energy
access for the poor, efficiency of energy consumption and/or
supply, and diversification of energy sources to reduce risk.

We are completing the implementation of the recommendations of the Volcker Report, to enhance transparency and
prevention, clarify responsibilities, strengthen follow-up
actions when we discover fraud and corruption, and make us
a stronger institution. We also launched our Governance and
Anti-Corruption (GAC] strategy, a key foundation for our
development work.

During fiscal 2008 the Bank Group committed $38.2 billion
in loans, grants, equity investments, and guarantees to its
members and to private businesses in member countries—an
increase of $3.9 billion (11.4 percent) from fiscal year 2007.

IDA commitments were $11.2 billion, 5 percent lower than
the previous year. IBRD commitments in fiscal 2008 totaled
$13.5 billion. IFC committed $11.4 billion for its own account
and mobilized an additional $4.8 billion for 372 private sector
investments in developing countries, more than 40 percent of
which were in IDA countries. Of MIGA’s $2.1 billion in guarantees, $690 million went to projects in IDA-eligible countries.
MIGA’s exposure in IDA countries now stands at $2.3 billion,
representing 35.6 percent of its portfolio.

We have built a good momentum, yet we have much to do to
advance an inclusive and sustainable globalization that offers
opportunities for all our client countries and their peoples.

In closing, | want to thank the dedicated staff of the World
Bank Group, in Washington and in offices in over one hundred
other countries, who are committed to transforming us into a
more dynamic, flexible, and innovative institution. | also want
to thank our Board of Directors, the Governors, and our many
contributors and partners. To be most effective and successful, we will need their ongoing help and counsel.

Robert B. ZoellickTHE BOARD OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

The Executive Directors are responsible for the conduct of the
Bank's general operations; they perform their duties under
powers delegated by the Board of Governors. As provided in
the Articles of Agreement, 5 of the 24 Executive Directors are
appointed by single-member countries having the largest
number of shares; the rest are elected by the other member
countries, which form constituencies in an election process
conducted every two years. The resident Board of Executive
Directors represents the evolving perspectives of member
countries on the role of the Bank Group.

The Board decides on IBRD loan and guarantee proposals
and on IDA credit, grant, and guarantee proposals made by
the President. Directors shape policies that guide general
operations of the Bank and its strategic direction. They are
responsible for presenting to the Governors at the Annual
Meetings audited accounts, an administrative budget, and the
Annual Report on the operations and policies of the Bank, and
other matters that, in their judgment, require submission to
the Governors. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), which
reports to the Board, provides independent advice on the
relevance, sustainability, efficiency, and effectiveness of
operations. (See http://www.worldbank.org/boards and
http://www.worldbank.org/ieg.}

Directors serve on one or more standing committees:
Audit, Budget, Committee on Development Effectiveness,
Ethics, Governance and Administrative Matters, and
Personnel. With the committees’ help, the Board discharges
its oversight responsibilities through in-depth examinations
of policies and practices. The Executive Directors’ Steering
Committee, an informal advisory body, meets regularly.

Directors play an active role in preparing agendas and
issue papers for the semiannual meetings of the joint World
Bank-International Monetary Fund Development Committee.

In fiscal 2008, Directors considered a variety of documents,
including the fifth Global Monitoring Report, which reviewed
progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs);
the framework for the Bank's role in global public goods; a
document on strengthening the Bank's engagement with IBRD
partner countries; a strategic framework on climate change
and economic development; and progress reports on the Bank
Group's plans for promoting clean energy, spurring progress
on Aid for Trade, and addressing food and energy prices.
Working jointly with the President of the World Bank in support
of the Bank Group’s goal of inclusive and sustainable globalization,
the Board helped shape implementation of the six strategic
themes presented at the 2007 Annual Meetings. The themes
focus on the poorest countries, particularly in Africa; fragile
and postconflict states; middle-income countries; global and
regional public goods; expanding opportunity for the Arab world;
and knowledge and learning. (See http://www.worldbank.org.}
During fiscal 2008, the Board approved the establishment of a
State- and Peace-Building Fund. The Directors highlighted the
principles of transparency and internal governance, project
integrity, anticorruption efforts, and cooperation with partners. In
response to the food crisis, the Board approved the Framework
for a Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP) and establishment of the Food Price Crisis Response (FPCR] Trust Fund and
the proposed transfer out of IBRD’s surplus to the FPCR Trust
Fund. Following the External Review Committee on Bank-IMF
collaboration, Directors considered the Joint Management
Action Plan, which provides a roadmap for effective collaboration by the Bretton Woods institutions to ensure consistent
policy advice to member countries. During fiscal 2008, Directors
visited Ethiopia, India, Madagascar, Malawi, Maldives, Mongolia,
Nepal, the Philippines, Tunisia, and the Republic of Yemen to
assess project implementation firsthand.

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2008 3COUNTRY PROGRAMS

During fiscal 2008, the Board considered 49 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) products. Of these, 12 were prepared with IFC,
and several were prepared collaboratively with other donors.

POVERTY REDUCTION

The Board’s work on poverty reduction continued to be heavily
influenced by its determination to accelerate progress toward
halving world poverty by 2015. It noted with concern that
progress continued to be uneven across countries and sectors,
and stressed the importance of sharpening the focus on the
links needed to achieve the MDGs; coordinating donor support
to ensure predictability of aid flows; supporting country training,
institutional capacity building, and the results agenda; and
addressing issues to help the Bank Group meet Paris
Declaration on Aid objectives. Poverty Reduction Strategy
Papers (PRSPs] lay out a country’s own poverty reduction
strategy (PRS) and specify the policies, programs, and
resources needed to achieve development and poverty
reduction goals. PRSPs describe the country’s macroeconomic, structural, and social policies and programs over the
medium to long term, as well as associated financing. PRSPs
and annual progress reports are country owned, and thus
are discussed, but not approved, by the Board and the IMF. In
fiscal 2008, 2? PRSP products were discussed. Africa accounted
for 16 PRSP products; followed by Europe and Central Asia,
and Latin America and the Caribbean, with 4 each; 3 in South
Asia; and 2 in East Asia and Pacific.

IDA15

Donor countries pledged a record $25.2 billion for the
World Bank to help overcome poverty in the poorest
countries. In total the 15th Replenishment of IDA (IDA15)
will provide $41.7 billion, an increase of $9.5 billion over
IDA14, the largest expansion in donor funding in IDA’s
history.

The Executive Directors’ Advisers, the IDA Deputies, played
noteworthy roles in the IDA discussion preparations, and
numerous Directors and their staffs participated in the IDA
Deputies’ five replenishment meetings.

The Board was pleased to endorse this most successful
IDA15 in February 2008. It reiterated the importance of IDA’s role
in building government capacity to design appropriate debt
management strategies and improve debt management. The
Board also reviewed one Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Completion Point document, one Preliminary HIPC document,
three HIPC Decision Point documents, and one Interim Debt
Relief document.

4 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2008

OVERSIGHT AND FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY

The Board exercises oversight and fiduciary responsibilities, in
part through its Audit Committee, which has a mandate to assist
in overseeing and making decisions about the Bank Group's
financial condition, its risk management and assessment
processes, the adequacy of its governance and controls, and its
reporting and accounting policies and procedures. This year the
Board addressed significant reform and strengthening of the
Bank Group's oversight and supporting systems. These included
changes to the Department of Institutional Integrity, the Office of
Ethics and Business Conduct, and several components of the
Conflict Resolution System, and the introduction of a WhistleBlower Policy for protected disclosures.

ADMINISTRATIVE BUDGET

The total budget for fiscal 2008 was $2,148.3 million, net of
reimbursements, including $175.5 million for the Development
Grant Facility and the Institutional Grant Programs. The net
budget of $1,637.1 million represented a 2.9 percent increase
over fiscal 2007. The Board approved a budget, net of reimbursements, of $2,179.1 million for fiscal 2009.

INSPECTION PANEL
The Inspection Panel provides a vehicle for private citizens,
especially poor people, to bring claims to the Bank's Board,
which decides, on the recommendation of the panel, whether to
launch an investigation. This process has given voice to people
who may have been adversely affected by Bank-financed projects.
In fiscal 2008, the Inspection Panel received six requests for
inspection involving Bank projects, five of which were registered. The panel recommended investigations in three cases.
(See http://www.worldbank.org/inspectionpanel.)

A GLOBAL WORKFORCE
A global community, the Bank staff represents 161 countries.
The work of IBRD and IDA is performed by about 8,600 people
working in Washington, DC, and in almost 120 country offices
worldwide. Today 36 percent of staff work in country offices.

Staff diversity is critical to the Bank's organizational
effectiveness. In 2007, the Bank Group adopted a five-year
Diversity & Inclusion Strategy for staff, emphasizing four key
themes—the role of leadership; more inclusive staffing
processes; new learning to promote behavior change; and
fresh metrics that focus on developing-country nationals,
gender, and Sub-Saharan African and Caribbean nationals.
The Bank Group's agenda supports staff with disabilities and
those of any sexual orientation.

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2008

5REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS, AND STAFF

To recruit and retain highly qualified staff, the World Bank Group has developed a compensation and benefits system designed
to be internationally competitive, to reward performance, and to take into account the special needs of a multinational and
largely expatriate staff. The Bank Group's staff salary structure is reviewed annually by the Executive Directors and, if warranted, is adjusted on the basis of a comparison with salaries paid by private financial and industrial firms and by representative
public sector agencies in the U.S. market. After analyses of updated comparator salaries, the Board approved an average
increase in the salary structure of 3.5 percent for fiscal 2008, effective July 1, 2007, for Washington-appointed staff.

The annual salaries (net of taxes] of executive management of the World Bank Group were as follows for the period July 1,
2007, through June 30, 2008:

6 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2008WORLD BANK GROUP FISCAL YEAR HIGHLIGHTS

Innovation and partnership bond the five institutions of the
World Bank Group (see page 9): the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD] and the International
Development Association (IDA), which together form the
World Bank; the International Finance Corporation (IFC); the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA); and the
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID]. The World Bank Group is one of the world’s largest
sources of funding and knowledge for developing countries. It
uses financial resources and extensive experience to help
poor nations reduce poverty, increase economic growth, and
improve the quality of life.

The World Bank Group’s work focuses on achievement of
the eight Millennium Development Goals [see sidebar, page 13).
The goals call for eliminating poverty and achieving inclusive
and sustainable globalization. The MDGs lay out a blueprint
for the World Bank Group, setting its priorities and measuring
its results. The World Bank is the world’s largest funder of
education; the world’s largest external funder of the fight
against HIV/AIDS; a leader in the fight against corruption
worldwide; a strong supporter of debt relief; and the largest
international financier of biodiversity, water supply, and
sanitation projects.

WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE
During fiscal 2008, the World Bank committed $24.7 billion in
loans, credits, and grants to its member countries. IDA commitments, to the world’s poorest countries, were $11.2 billion,
5 percent lower than the previous year. IBRD commitments
in fiscal 2008 totaled $13.5 billion, 5 percent higher than the
previous year. IFC committed $11.4 billion for its own account
and mobilized an additional $4.8 billion for 372 private sector
investments in developing countries, more than 40 percent of
which were in IDA countries. MIGA issued close to $2.1 billion
in guarantees in support of investments in the developing
world, an increase of $730 million over fiscal 2007. Of the
total, $690 million went to IDA-eligible countries.

Africa received the highest Bank Group support, at more than
$7.2 billion in loans, grants, equity investments, and guarantees,
which is a record for the region.

 

COLLABORATING TO ADVANCE

AN INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GLOBALIZATION

The World Bank, IFC, and MIGA work together and independently to eliminate poverty, foster growth, and ensure
that development is inclusive and sustainable. Joint
ventures that mitigate or design solutions for today’s
most pressing issues—the struggle with rising food prices,
the impact of greenhouse gas emissions, and the battle
against communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS and
malaria—are especially rewarding and serve as a model
of cooperation.

The recipients of the World Bank Group’s fiscal 2008 financial
commitments are using the funds in more than 670 projects,
many of them collaborative efforts of two or more of the affiliates. The projects are designed to overcome poverty and
enhance growth by improving education and health services,
promoting private sector development, building infrastructure,
and strengthening governance and institutions. They are
practical plans to help developing countries move from poverty
and become more competitive in a globalizing world.

IFC contributed a $500 million grant to IDA in fiscal 2008
as part of an indicative program for grants to IDA15 of up to
$1.8 billion. A new IDA-IFC secretariat has been established
to identify and pursue opportunities for increasing joint Bank
Group efforts that support private sector development in the
countries IDA serves. While IDA will continue to focus on
the public sector, it can now draw more readily on IFC's
expertise to ensure the private sector does its part to
improve lives in IDA countries.

Bank Group coordination is also evident where private
investment and public policy are closely interconnected. IFC
and IBRD have joint departments covering several aspects
of private investment and the government activities that
enable it. Joint industry departments focus on information
and communication technologies; oil, gas, mining, and
chemicals; and subnational finance, principally for infrastructure. IFC and IBRD also collaborate in advising on
small and medium enterprises, capital markets, and
corporate governance.

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2008 7Joint efforts to improve the investment climate in developing countries include the annual IFC-Bank publication Doing
Business, which compares 178 economies on the ease of
starting and running a business. IBRD, IFC, and MIGA
collaborate through the Foreign Investment Advisory Service,
a multidonor service that advises developing and transition
governments on ways to improve their investment climates.

The Bank Group is also preparing a Strategic Framework
on Climate Change and Development—a plan for integrating
climate change and development challenges without compromising growth and poverty reduction efforts. The framework
will include priorities, approaches, and a road map for action
in helping countries mitigate or adapt to climate change.

In addition, the Bank Group has set a goal of scaling up its
portfolio of investments in renewable energy and energy
efficiency projects by an annual average of 20 percent
through 2010.

The World Bank Group also has a shared commitment to
results-oriented development, through the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG], which assesses the relevance, efficacy,
and efficiency of Bank Group programs and their contribution
to development effectiveness. IEG has evaluation units at the
World Bank, IFC, and MIGA, which independently evaluate
their respective institutions’ financial and advisory services
operations with a particular focus on accountability.

The Bank Group increasingly undertakes innovative joint
initiatives. One of the farthest-reaching is a regional integration assistance strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa that seeks to
strengthen collaboration among the region's countries with a
focus on cross-border challenges: infrastructure; economic
cooperation and harmonization; and regional approaches for
addressing climate change, agricultural productivity, shared
water resources, and health.

One key project is a fiber-optic cable that will connect 21
East African countries to each other and the rest of the world
with high-quality broadband Internet access and international
communications services. Widely considered a model for
cooperation among major development finance institutions,
the East African Submarine Cable System has raised a total of

8 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2008

$70.7 million in long-term financing. The cable is expected to
reduce the cost of the area’s broadband services, currently
among the highest in the world, and to stimulate development
of new knowledge-based industries, call centers, and similar
ventures.

Another joint initiative is the Bujagali Hydropower Project,
designed to alleviate a severe power shortage in Uganda that
daily affects the lives and livelihoods of millions. The largest
independent power project in Africa, the plant will generate
electricity by recycling water released from nearby hydropower
facilities. The financing package includes a $130 million IFC
loan, a partial risk guarantee of up to $115 million from
IDA, and an investment guarantee of up to $115 million from
MIGA. Seven other development finance institutions are
supporting the project in recognition of its expected development impact.

The Global Emerging Markets Local Currency (Gemloc]
bond program is an innovative effort through which the Bank
Group promotes local currency bond markets using marketbased incentives. Gemloc was designed in response to
numerous governments that wanted to strengthen their bond
markets and better support economic growth with stability.
Under the program, PIMCO, a leading private investment
manager, is developing investment strategies for local bonds.
Markit, a private sector index company, has collaborated with
IFC to create a new, transparent bond index, and the World
Bank is providing advisory services to strengthen local
markets, improve their “investability,” and attract more
foreign and domestic investors.

A $1 billion rehabilitation and expansion of the Queen Alia
International Airport in Amman represents the largest private
investment in Jordan's history and illustrates the way the
Bank Group links its advisory and investment work. IFC
advised the government on the competitive bidding process
and more recently helped mobilize funding for the project
through a syndication that attracted six European and Middle
Eastern banks. The World Bank and the Islamic Development
Bank also provided significant funding.THE WORLD BANK GROUP INSTITUTIONS

AN INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GLOBALIZATIONOVERCOMING CHALLENGES

AND CREATING OPPORTUNITIES

A year that saw soaring food and commodity prices reaffirmed
the role the World Bank plays in international economic
development and poverty reduction worldwide. The Bank’s
achievements over the past year illustrate its ability to tackle
global crises and support sustainable growth with care for
the environment in its client countries while safeguarding
and improving people’s health, education, and other human
development outcomes. The Bank collaborates with numerous other multilateral organizations and partners to realize
the most far-reaching results possible.

Much needs to be done without delay to alleviate global
crises. An estimated 2.5 billion people are trying to survive
on $2 or less a day. The slide of the U.S. dollar and resulting
weakening economy, together with the credit crunch, have led
to a global financial crisis, which has clearly and significantly
put added stress on the poorest people. Skyrocketing food
prices are a harsh reality, resulting in even greater hunger
and malnutrition worldwide. The World Bank responded in
May 2008 with a rapid financing facility for the food crisis,
addressing immediate needs with immediate action. Swift
needs assessments were undertaken in the field with the
World Food Program, the Food and Agriculture Organization,
and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. The
first grants under the facility were approved for Djibouti
($5 million), Haiti ($10 million), and Liberia ($10 million).

Other commodity costs continue to climb, with the potential
to make the most basic necessities inaccessible for many.
Climate change threatens agricultural productivity and
consequently the world’s food supply as well as the income
of most of the poorest people. Natural catastrophes, such
as this year’s earthquake in China and cyclone in Myanmar,
devastate millions who may not survive without immediate
disaster relief. Communicable diseases, with HIV/AIDS and

12 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2008

On a radio show in Céte d'ivoire, refugees from Conakry, Guinea,
discuss the challenges they face

malaria being the most critical, continue to challenge us. The
World Bank, in collaboration with its member countries and
international partners, is making progress in the face of these
challenges.

It is projected that the increase in the gross domestic
product (GDP] for developing countries will decline to 7.1 percent
in 2008, whereas high-income countries are predicted to grow
by a modest 2.2 percent. Globally, poverty is in decline,
exemplified by East Asia, where the Millennium Development
Goal (MDG) of halving extreme poverty by 2015 from 1990
levels already has been achieved. Progress on poverty
reduction and the other MDGs varies widely, however, and
conditions are especially dire in Africa, where extreme poverty
is expected to grow. Africa, especially its Sub-Saharan
nations, is the Bank’s priority continent for action.

The International Development Association is the Bank's
arm for supporting the world’s poorest countries in their
efforts to boost economic growth, lower poverty, and improve
people’s living conditions. It is the largest multilateral channel
for providing concessional financing to countries with low per
capita income, with a special emphasis on Sub-Saharan
Africa. For the 15th Replenishment of IDA (IDA15), 45 donor
countries pledged a record $25.2 billion in December 2007
to further the cause of overcoming poverty in the poorest of
the low-income countries around the world. In total, IDA15
will provide $41.7 billion, an increase of 30 percent over the
IDA14 replenishment. This is the greatest expansion in donor
funding in the history of IDA. The World Bank Group pledged
a record $3.5 billion transfer to IDA from IBRD’s net income
($1.8 billion) and designations of IFC’s retained earnings for
grants to IDA of up to $1.8 billion. Today the World Bank is
in a strong position, with unprecedented funding, to move
further toward achieving the Millennium Development
Goals, chief among them, eradication of extrerne poverty
and hunger.This Annual Report details the numerous activities the
World Bank has pursued in the past fiscal year in the fight
against poverty, concentrating on three major areas:
the Bank's agenda for low-income countries, including
countering the effects of rising food prices and increasing
lending in agriculture and rural development; middleincome country initiatives, such as the Economic Research
Forum in the Middle East and the Bank's recent innovations

MIDPOINT PROGRESS TOWARD THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS

 

in lending; and global issues, including commodity prices,
climate change, governance and anticorruption, and
gender.

REDUCING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

At the heart of the World Bank's work is its focus on poverty
reduction and inclusive growth. Despite progress achieved
over the past few years, about 1 billion people—15 percent of

 

Many achievements have brought the MDG targets for 2015 within reach in
some cases. For the goals to be realized, six criteria must be met: stronger
and more inclusive growth in Africa and fragile states, more effort in health
and education, integration of the development and environment agendas,
more and better aid, movement on trade negotiations, and stronger and
more focused support from multilateral institutions like the World Bank.

1. Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger

From 1990 through 2004, the proportion of people living in extreme
poverty fell from almost a third to less than a fifth. Although results vary
widely within regions and countries, the trend indicates that the world
as a whole can meet the goal of halving the percentage of people living
in poverty. Africa’s poverty, however, is expected to rise, and most of the
36 countries where 90 percent of the world’s undernourished children
live are in Africa. Less than a quarter of countries are on track for
achieving the goal of halving undernutrition.

2. Achieve Universal Primary Education

The number of children in school in developing countries increased
from 80 percent in 1991 to 88 percent in 2005. Still, about 72 million
children of primary school age, 57 percent of them girls, were not
being educated as of 2005

3. Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women

The tide is turning slowly for women in the labor market, yet far more
women than men—worldwide more than 60 percent—are contributing but
unpaid family workers. The World Bank Group Gender Action Plan was
created to advance women’s economic empowerment and promote
shared growth.

4. Reduce Child Mortality
There is some improvement in survival rates globally; accelerated
improvements are needed most urgently in South Asia and Sub-Saharan

Africa. An estimated 10 million-plus children under five died in 2005;
most of their deaths were from preventable causes.

5. Improve Maternal Health

Almost all of the half million women who die during pregnancy or
childbirth every year live in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. There are
numerous causes of maternal death that require a variety of health care
interventions to be made widely accessible.

6. Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases

Annual numbers of new HIV infections and AIDS deaths have fallen,
but the number of people living with HIV continues to grow. In the
eight worst-hit southern African countries, prevalence is above
15 percent. Treatment has increased globally, but still meets
only 30 percent of needs (with wide variations across countries).
AIDS remains the leading cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa
(1.6 million deaths in 2007). There are 300 to 500 million cases of
malaria each year, leading to more than 1 million deaths. Nearly
all the cases and more than 95 percent of the deaths occur in
Sub-Saharan Africa

7. Ensure Environmental Sustainability

Deforestation remains a critical problem, particularly in regions of
biological diversity, which continues to decline. Greenhouse gas
emissions are increasing faster than energy technology advancement.

8. Develop a Global Partnership for Development

Donor countries have renewed their commitment. Donors have to fulfill
their pledges to match the current rate of core program development.
Emphasis is being placed on the Bank Group's collaboration with
multilateral and local partners to quicken progress toward the MDGs’
realization.

(See http://www.developmentgoals.org.]

AN INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GLOBALIZATION 13the world’s population—still live on less than $1 a day, and
2.5 billion live on less than $2 a day.

The poor typically lack access to education, adequate
health services, and clean water and sanitation. They are
more vulnerable to economic shocks, natural disasters,
violence, and crime. The Bank continues to support countryowned development strategies that seek to reduce poverty by
expanding growth opportunities. It seeks to improve the ability
of poor households to participate in the economy and to have
better access to basic services. The Bank focuses on improving infrastructure and risk management instruments and on
creating more accountable and transparent institutions.

Poverty Projections

Recent estimates suggest that over the next decade the share
of the population living in extreme poverty is expected to
decline in all developing regions but by greatly varying degrees.
By 2015, the share of the population in developing countries
living on less than $1 a day will stand at 10 percent, down from
29 percent in 1990. The absolute number of people in extreme
poverty globally is tentatively projected to fall from 1.2 billion in
1990 and 970 million in 2004 to 624 million in 2015.

Although the decline in world poverty is a positive sign,
poverty reduction has been highly uneven across regions.

In East Asia the goal of halving extreme poverty has already
been achieved: the percentage of people living on $1 a day
is expected to drop to 2 percent [although the percentage of
people living on $2 a day will account for a still significant
15 percent). At the other extreme is Sub-Saharan Africa.
Despite a 4.7 percentage point decline in the share of people
living in extreme poverty between 1999 and 2004, some

31 percent of Africa’s population will still be living on less
than $1 a day by 2015—higher than the MDG target of 23 percent. There are some exceptions, however; countries such
as Ghana, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Uganda are making
solid progress toward the MDGs.

The recent increase in food prices may set back recent
gains in reducing poverty. Preliminary estimates from the
World Bank indicate that the persistence of current food
prices may well translate into losing almost seven years of
progress in poverty reduction, with up to 105 million people in
low-income countries pushed into poverty over the next three

14 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2008

years. Higher food prices may also heighten inequality within
countries, worsen malnutrition, and aggravate the vulnerability
of people living with conflict, HIV, or drought conditions.

To help countries respond to this crisis, the Bank is working
closely with UN agencies on a common strategy, responding
in four main ways: with policy advice, expedited financing,
financial market insurance products, and research. The Bankhas launched the Global Food Crisis Response Program, a
facility providing up to $1.2 billion of accelerated financial
support and technical advice to especially vulnerable countries.

Employment and Inclusive Growth

Rising inequality over the 1990s has severely reduced the
potential impact on poverty from the rapid growth experienced by many countries. On average, between 1990 and
2004, only one-third of growth in output transferred to growth
in employment.

Demographic trends suggest that the next decades will see
growing pressure to create employment opportunities in most
low-income countries in response to a sustained growth in
labor supply that follows from continuing sharp increases
in the working-age population and in female labor market
participation. Sub-Saharan Africa will have to grow more than
three times faster than projected simply to maintain current
employment rates.

Many of the poor are employed but earn a below-subsistence
living. Recent estimates suggest that over 500 million people
(18 percent of the employed] are “working poor,” earning less
than $2 a day—and this share is growing worldwide, with the
exception of India and China. Thus, for growth to be inclusive, a
rmultipronged approach to create jobs in selected sectors while
enhancing the quality of employment, especially labor income,
in others must be implemented.

The Doha Round

Despite the July 2008 failure of the Doha discussions, the
World Bank continues to support the completion of an
ambitious Doha Round of trade talks. Successful conclusion

of the Doha agreement would improve the functioning of the
multilateral trading system and help establish more efficient
and resilient agricultural and nonagricultural trade globally.
It would reduce the distortions in agricultural trade created
by decades of subsidies by developed countries and import
barriers by both developed and developing countries. The Doha
agreement would increase incentives to invest in agricultural
markets—including in low-income countries—and in the long
run would help reduce the chance of future global food price
crises. Overall, the agreement would provide a more supportive
international framework for developing countries, especially
the world’s poorest, as they seek to improve their trade performance; integrate into the world economy; and achieve more
rapid, sustainable, and inclusive economic growth. The Bank
is scaling up its Aid for Trade activities to strengthen in-country
programs on trade and competitiveness.

AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT

Even before the rapid rise in food prices, the World Bank had
sharpened its focus on the critical role that agriculture and
rural development can play in helping people move out of
poverty. Agriculture is critical because some 75 percent of the
world’s poor live in rural areas, and the sector has a powerful
influence on economic growth, poverty reduction, and
environmental sustainability.

The World Development Report 2008: Agriculture for
Development, released in October 2007, focuses on three key
sets of recommendations: increasing agricultural productivity, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa; shrinking growing
income inequalities between rural and urban areas in more

 

The Development Marketplace program is a small-grants program that
identifies and funds innovative, early-stage projects with high potential for
development impact. It is supported by many organizations, chief among
them the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Global Environment
Facility, and is administered by the Bank.

The program's merit-based competition attracts ideas from a range of
innovators, including civil society groups and businesses. Competitions
are held annually at regional, country, and global levels.

The 2008 global competition, devoted to sustainable agriculture for development, attracted over 1,700 applicants. One hundred finalists from 42 countries
were selected by agriculture development experts from inside and outside

the Bank Group. These finalists were invited to attend the Development
Marketplace event at Bank headquarters September 24-26, 2008. At the

event, 25-30 project leaders were selected to receive up to $200,000 each to
implement their ideas over two years. The Bank will monitor implementation
and commission independent evaluations of the projects about 18 months
after they close. (See http://www.developmentmarketplace.org.}

to environmental sustainability everywhere. (See http://www
.worldbank.org/wdr2008.]

Consistent with the WDR message about the need for more
and better investments in agriculture for development, the
Bank is planning a major scale-up of lending in agriculture and
rural development in fiscal 2009, especially in Sub-Saharan
Africa. Underperformance in agriculture has been a major
limitation of Africa’s development, according to the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG). For most of the past two decades,
both governments and donors, including the World Bank,
have neglected the sector. Lending from the Bank has been
sprinkled across various agricultural activities such as research,
extension, credit, seed provision, and policy reforms in rural
space, but with insufficient recognition of the synergies
among them. Drawing on its comparative advantage as a
multisector lending institution and as the single largest donor
to African agriculture, the Bank now has an opportunity to
help ensure a coordinated and multifaceted approach to
agriculture development in Africa.

The Bank is working to align client priorities and harmonize partner efforts in agricultural initiatives. The Bank is
supporting the African Union’s Comprehensive African
Agricultural Development Plan as well as the Global Donor
Platform for Rural Development, made up of 29 donor
agencies active in agriculture and rural development. The
Bank has also increased its dialogue and diagnostic studies
with partners at the country level.

ASSISTING FRAGILE AND CONFLICT-AFFECTED COUNTRIES
Following the approval of a new Rapid Response to Crises and
Emergencies policy in February 2007, the separate conflict and
fragility agendas were merged with the creation of the Fragile
and Conflict-Affected Countries Group in July 2007. The aim is
to deliver effective programs, in collaboration with other
partners, in support of sustainable growth and economic and
social development, peace building, and sound governance.
Although fragile states are not necessarily afflicted with
conflict, and conflict-affected countries are not always hindered
by fragile governance, troubling attributes exist in both. Hence,
the Bank and some of its partners recognize the commonalities
and believe that they should support these at-risk countries.

16 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2008

The assistance will be based on institutional research on
conflict prevention and reconstruction as well as on studies of
links between peace- and state-building and governance.

STRENGTHENING SUPPORT

FOR MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES

Middle-income countries are critical to the Bank's fight against
global poverty, as they are home to nearly 70 percent of the
world’s poor (defined as people who earn less than $2 a day).Most of these countries face constraints in mobilizing the
funds needed to invest in infrastructure, health, education,

and the reform of policies and institutions essential to
improving the investment climate. Some middle-income
countries are able to borrow on foreign markets or access
risk management instruments, but often where these sources
of finance are available, the maturities are usually short and
the rates high. A few middle-income countries have achieved
investment-grade ratings.

By implementing the strategy for middle-income countries
endorsed by the Development Committee in 2006, the Bank is
responding to continuing strong demand for both traditional
and innovative products. Based on client demand in middleincome countries, this response could include requiring
governments to make substantial contributions to financing,
requiring payment for technical assistance and advisory
services, and making Bank loans available to provincial and
local governments. A task force, convened in fiscal 2008 to
build on the work started in 2006, identified four areas of
emphasis: improving client responsiveness and flexibility;
expanding the range and use of financial products; building
a dynamic organization leveraging Bank Group synergies;
and building knowledge to take on 21st century challenges,
particularly through local partnerships and enhanced
South-South cooperation.

The Bank has improved the delivery of customized development solutions by introducing a range of financial and
nonfinancial innovations. On the financial side, during fiscal
2008, IBRD announced the biggest simplification of and
reduction in its loan pricing since the Asian financial crisis.
(See http://www.worldbank.org/ibrd.]

Borrowers now have access to IBRD loans at longer
maturities and at prices that are lower and more transparent
than they had been. In response to demand for market-based
instruments to address catastrophic risk, the Bank Group
launched the Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility;
it also enhanced existing contingent loan products to address
countries’ emergency liquidity needs following catastrophes and
other exogenous shocks. The IFC’s Global Index Reinsurance
Facility is in place, and the Bank Group initiated the Global
Emerging Markets Local Currency (Gemloc] bond program to
help catalyze the development of local currency bond markets

 

in emerging market countries. The Bank Group is also exploring
other mechanisms for local currency lending and is considering
innovative approaches for funding climate change and green
initiatives. For example, Mexico signed the first climate change
development policy loan in May 2008.

On the nonfinancial side, the Bank introduced simple
projects that can be easily replicated, mechanisms for
additional financing of successful projects, and revisions to
emergency and rapid response lending policies. The Bank has
been piloting the use of country systems, approved by the Board
in April 2008, for financial management and safeguards, and
it plans to pilot national procurement systems shortly. Up to
10 countries with a mix of income levels will participate in the
procurement pilot, with at least one pilot country in each
region. The Bank is also trying to identify ways to streamline
its investment lending procedures so that it is more flexible
and better equipped to deliver its products under the Bank’s
new business model for middle-income countries. (See
http://www.worldbank.org/middleincomecountries.]

HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND GENDER

Complementing the Bank's strategic investment in markets,
the human development agenda helps people in developing

countries acquire the good health, education, and skills they
need to succeed in the workplace, live better, and contribute
to national cohesion and economic growth.

Health

In fiscal 2008, the Bank committed $948 million in its
continuing efforts to significantly improve health

outcomes, while also moving ahead to implement its
Health, Nutrition, and Population (HNP) Strategy, “Healthy
Development,” approved by the Board in April 2007. The
strategy reinforces the Bank's ultimate objective to
improve the state of people's health, especially in poor and
vulnerable groups, under the aegis of its overall mission to
reduce poverty and spur opportunity. The HNP strategy calls
for the Bank to focus rigorously on its key strengths in
health systems-strengthening and health financing and
economics, and also to help government leaders and the
international community to commit to achieving and
monitoring results.

AN INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GLOBALIZATION 7Progress was made in terms of knowledge development
and country-specific work in keeping with the strategy. In
particular, budgets were approved to generate new knowledge
products, which focused on lessons learned from country
experience on good practice in health-financing reform,
governance mechanisms for mandatory health insurance,
analysis of restrictions and mechanism for overcoming
bottlenecks in the implementation of health strategies in
low-income countries, and the initiation of work on human
resource constraints and fiscal space for health. In addition,
as a result of a highly generous contribution from Norway,
a trust fund of $100 million was set up for results-based
financing in at least four low-income countries.
Implementation has also started at the regional level,
especially in Africa, in the areas of results-based financing,
human resources for health, and harmonization and
alignment of donor aid.

In addition, the Bank continued its work with client
countries and global and regional partners to prevent and
treat communicable diseases, which are the leading killers
of children and adults in the developing world, claiming
more than 12 million lives a year. Although several potentially deadly epidemics have been contained, HIV and others
remain threats. Dengue and yellow fever have reappeared;
tuberculosis killed 1.6 million people in 2005; and more
than 1 million people die of malaria every year, mostly
infants, young children, and pregnant women, and most
of them in Africa.

The current food crisis is derailing recent gains in reducing malnutrition. Between 1990 and 2005, the share of
children under five with moderate and severe stunting fell
from 33.5 percent worldwide to 24.1 percent. While food
prices are not the main driver of malnutrition, they do affect
nutritional outcomes through their impact on real incomes
and household purchasing behavior.

In addition to emphasizing a cross-sectoral approach for
achieving the health-related MDGs, the Bank is implementing
the bold agenda of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.
For example, the Health 8, an informal group of heads of
health-related organizations, was formed to amplify an
urgent appeal to accelerate efforts to achieve the MDGs and
to share accountability for progress at the country level. The

18 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2008

International Health Partnership (IHP+], led by the World
Health Organization and the Bank, is a new and crucial
development in this context. Since its initiation in 2007, this
partnership has grown to include 15 African and Asian
countries and 10 major donor countries. IHP+ seeks to
align donors with recipient country interests through
mutual accountability in a concerted quest to attain the
health MDGs.

Education

The Bank provides about a fourth of global external funding
for education, making it the largest donor in the world in the
sector. The Bank’s portfolio of education projects was $7.4
billion by the end of fiscal 2008, funding 140 operations in 92
countries. New commitments accounted for 7.8 percent of
total Bank lending. Over the past four years, its lending for
education has remained steady at about $2 billion a year,
about half of it through IDA on concessionary terms. About
35 percent of all Bank aid for education in fiscal 2008 was
provided through multisector investment projects and
multisector development policy loans.

The Bank's education sector completed several important
research studies in fiscal 2008. These studies—on linking
education policy to labor market outcomes; science, technology,
and innovation; school-based management; and educational
assessment—amplified the connections among education,
empowerment, opportunity, and economic growth.

Gender
During fiscal 2007, the Bank adopted an action plan to
empower women economically. Gender Equality as Smart
Economics was endorsed by the Group of Eight heads of state
in June 2007. In April 2008, the Bank announced six new
commitments on gender equality, including improving the
integration of gender equality into agriculture and rural
development projects by 2010, channeling through IFC at
least $100 million in credit lines at commercial banks for
women entrepreneurs by 2012, and increasing IDA investments for gender equality.

Fiscal 2008 saw activities launched in all developing
regions to promote investments to better integrate womeninto the economy by increasing their access to land, labor,
credit, and product markets. These activities aim to promote
women’s transition to good-quality employment; to increase
the number of women starting agribusinesses and engaging
in high-value agriculture; and to boost women’s access to

 

essential infrastructure services, particularly transportation,
water, and energy.

The Bank launched a research program in fiscal 2008 as
part of the Doing Business project on reforms that improve
business opportunities for women. In partnership with the Nike
Foundation, it began investigating ways to promote economic
opportunity for adolescent girls by providing conditional cash
transfers and skills training that matches labor market needs.
Financial support from the governments of Australia, Canada,
Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the
United Kingdom and from the Nike Foundation continues to
encourage innovation in mainstreaming gender issues in the
Bank's work. (See http://www.worldbank.org/gender.]

Social Protection and Labor

This sector helps client countries create good jobs, provide
effective assistance programs for poor and vulnerable groups,
and better manage risk. It focuses on six main areas: labor
markets, pensions, social safety nets, social funds, vulnerable
groups (such as the disabled and child workers], and social
risk management.

Through lending interventions and analytical work, the
Bank is helping clients to improve the functioning of their
labor markets and the creation of better jobs through improved regulations, active labor market programs, and
unemployment benefit schemes. Its efforts are enhanced by
a multidonor trust fund on employment creation, established
at the end of calendar year 2007, which is closing knowledge
gaps, supporting capacity building, and helping countries
implement a multisector operations framework known as
MILES (macroeconomics, investment climate, labor market
institutions, education and skills, and social protection).

(See http://www.worldbank.org/sp.]

HARNESSING THE COMMODITIES BOOM

FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

A commodities boom in oil, gas, and minerals in many
parts of the developing world is opening opportunities for
marshaling the resulting revenue windfalls for sustainable
development. Commodity prices have fluctuated considerably

AN INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GLOBALIZATION 19since 2000; in the past year they had risen, in general, by
more than 75 percent as compared with 2000 prices. Nearly
half of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population lives in countries
that are rich in oil, gas, or hard-mineral resources. The
challenge is to effectively channel the revenue into programs that fight poverty, hunger, malnutrition, illiteracy,
and disease.

Transforming natural resource wealth into long-term
economic growth requires sound practices across a broad
set of issues, including awarding and monitoring contracts;
collecting revenue; managing the economy, including price
volatility; and investing revenues effectively for national
development. The Bank is creating a new partnership—
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative Plus Plus
(EITI++]—with multilateral, bilateral, private sector, academic,
and civil society partners. This country-driven initiative will
provide technical assistance and build national capacity
across the natural resources value chain.

Even with efficient financial markets, a critical challenge remains for many developing countries. One of the
cruel ironies today is the connection between rising energy
and food prices. Higher energy prices have increased
fertilizer and transport costs and stimulated biofuel
production.

Food and energy prices usually represent over 70 percent
of the consumption basket of the poor. In the face of even
higher prices, poor households will cut back on food consumption and education—and girls will invariably be the first
withdrawn from schooling. Reliance on traditional fuels will
increase with damaging consequences to the environment.

CLIMATE CHANGE

In line with the World Bank Group’s plan to ramp up work on
climate change, the Bank significantly accelerated its efforts
to help client countries cope with climate change while
respecting another aspect of its core mission: promoting
economic development and poverty reduction by helping
provide modern energy to growing economies. Drawing on
more than a decade of experience in the field, the World Bank
responded to increasing calls in the international community
to work faster and do more to help developing countries

mitigate the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and adapt
to the risks and impacts posed by climate change.

The starting point for the Bank's work is the recognition
that climate change is more than an environmental challenge;
it is also an economic, development, and investment challenge
that calls for urgent action. For many developing countries, the
impact can be enormous: they stand to suffer the most from
climate change because of their geographic location and
sensitivity to extreme weather events. In IDA-eligible countries, for instance, 870,000 people have been killed and almost
2.5 billion affected by climate-related disasters over the past
25 years. Apart from the immediate drama of disaster, climate
change can reduce agricultural productivity, deplete already
scarce water resources, increase the incidence of devastating
vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue, and harm
ecological systems and their biodiversity.

The Bank Group launched a series of global consultations with stakeholders to help formulate a Strategic
Framework on Climate Change and Development by the
end of 2008. This framework will outline the organization's
integrated approach to the issue. The Bank had already
set goals for piloting adaptation instruments and reducing
greenhouse gas emissions by increasing lending for clean
energy while also significantly increasing access to electricity, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, Bank
lending for energy rose to $4.2 billion in fiscal 2008, and
the share of low-carbon projects in the Bank's energy
portfolio grew to about 40 percent. Low-carbon growth
country case studies were launched for Brazil, China,

India, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa. In late 2007, the
Board of Directors approved the creation of two new carbon
finance facilities, the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility
and the Carbon Partnership Facility. These new facilities
complement the more than $2 billion allocated to 10 other
carbon funds and facilities the Bank currently manages.
Sixteen governments and 66 private companies from
various sectors have contributed to these funds. (See
http://www.worldbank.org/climatechange.]

The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) assessed Bank
Group support for the environment to its clients in public and
private sectors from 1990 through 2007. It found that this
support has increased significantly and performance hasimproved, especially since 2001, when the Bank Group’s first
explicit strategy for the environment was adopted. According
to the IEG, an even greater effort is required, however, anda
number of key constraints still need to be overcome, including
insufficient government commitment to environmental goals
and weak institutional capacity on the ground. The Bank
Group also needs to update its environment strategy; further
strengthen cross-sectoral collaboration; improve mechanisms to monitor and assess environmental results and
impacts of its lending and nonlending services; and improve
coordination both internally among the Bank, IFC, and MIGA
and with its external development partners.

STRENGTHENING GOVERNANCE
AND REDUCING CORRUPTION
The World Bank Group's strategy to scale up assistance to
improve governance and fight corruption in client countries
was unanimously endorsed by the Board in March 2007. An
implementation plan was launched in December 2007, anda
Governance and Anticorruption Council was created, chaired
by the Managing Directors on a rotating basis, with seniorlevel representation from across the Bank Group. The strategy
calls for action on four key fronts: supporting good governance and anticorruption at the country level, preventing
corruption in Bank-financed projects, addressing the private
sector's role in public sector governance and anticorruption
efforts, and supporting global efforts to reduce corruption.
The Bank is the leading donor globally in providing support for
strengthening public sector management. In fiscal 2008, Bank
support for governance and rule of law was $4.7 billion—
$4.4 billion for public sector governance and $304 million
to support improvements in the rule of law. This support
accounted for 19 percent of total Bank lending.

IEG examined lending and other Bank support in 19992006 for public sector reform in four areas: public financial

THE STOLEN ASSET RECOVERY (StAR) INITIATIVE

 

management, administrative and civil service, revenue
administration, and anticorruption and transparency. It found
that among countries borrowing for public sector reform,
more than 80 percent of IBRD and 69 percent of IDA borrowers showed improved performance. IEG noted that bank
lending for public sector reform was successful when
reform objectives were realistic and institutional capacity
was considered. Moving forward, improvements in human
resource management reforms and the complex political
and sequencing issues of reform efforts are key areas on
which the Bank should focus, particularly in low-income
and fragile settings.

The Bank is a leader in the development and application of
governance diagnostics, such as Doing Business reports,
investment climate surveys, public expenditure tracking surveys,
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability indicators, the
World Bank Institute (WBI] governance and anticorruption
country diagnostics, and the WBI governance indicators.

An example of WBI's assistance to build capacity was an
interactive global event, “Business and the Rules of the
Game,” organized by WBI and InWent (Capacity Building
International, Germany] for more than 300 private sector,
government, civil society, and multilateral agency leaders.
People from 49 countries discussed the role of business
in fighting corruption, responding to climate change, and
advancing the MDGs.

The Department of Institutional Integrity (INT) investigates
allegations of fraud and corruption in Bank-financed projects
as well as allegations of possible staff misconduct. INT
reports its findings to the Bank's senior management, which
in turn decides on corrective measures to be taken. Since
1999, INT has handled nearly 3,000 cases of alleged fraud,
corruption, or other wrongdoing, resulting in the public
debarment of 340 companies and individuals, whose names
have been listed on the Bank’s Web site.

 

The World Bank Group, in partnership with the UN Office on Drugs and
Crime, launched StAR in September 2007. The initiative seeks to help
developing countries track, freeze, and recover the proceeds of corruption
and prevent government funds from being stolen. StAR helps build the
capacity to request the legal assistance necessary to recover assets,

urges financial centers to lower barriers that retard asset recovery,
develops partnerships to share information and experience, and offers
expertise on making transparent the use of recovered assets for
development purposes. It also works with UN member nations to ratify
and implement the United Nations Convention Against Corruption.

AN INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GLOBALIZATION 21In fiscal 2008, an independent panel headed by former U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker reviewed the work of
INT within the context of the World Bank Group's governance
and anticorruption strategy and affirmed that INT must play
a central part in that effort. The Bank announced in January
2008 that it would implement the Volcker panel's recommendations. These include the creation of an independent advisory
board composed of international anticorruption experts to
protect the independence and strengthen the accountability
of INT, as well as the formation of a preventive services
consulting unit to help Bank staff guard against fraud and
corruption in Bank projects. In addition, a vice president-level
position was created to head INT. (See http://www.worldbank
.org/integrity.]

In the spirit and interest of good organizational governance, members of the Bank Group's Executive Management
team authorized public disclosure of a summary of the annual
statement of their 2007 financial interests and activities filed
during 2008. The Executive Managers have committed to
public disclosure to help demonstrate to stakeholders that
in the discharge of their official duties and responsibilities,
they are not, and do not appear to be, influenced by improper
consideration associated with their own private interests. The
summary disclosure statements are to be posted on the Bank
Group's public Web site after an internal review and certification by the Bank Group’s Office of Ethics and Business

The World Bank’s Voices of the Poor project asked 60,000
people around the world how they hoped to escape poverty.
For men and women alike, the two most common responses
were employment in a business of their own and income
earned from a job. Their answers underline why private sector
and financial sector development are a critical part of the
Bank Group's strategy: the private sector is the key generator
of jobs and incomes that help the poor rise out of poverty.

 

Improving ate

The Doing Business project is a core piece of the Bank’s
poverty reduction strategy; it focuses on the regulatory
burdens faced by small and medium enterprises. The annual
Doing Business reports compare indicators on business
regulations and their enforcement in 178 countries. (See
http://www.doingbusiness.org.}

Country coverage of the Bank’s enterprise surveys continues to expand. Results on 75,000 firms in 105 countries are
now available online. This information—which includes data
on business perceptions and dozens of indicators on the
quality of the business environment—helps underpin Bank
operational work.In July 2007, the Board endorsed the 2008-11 strategy
for the multidonor Foreign Investment Advisory Service
(FIAS). The focus of FIAS has shifted from regional programs to technical advice centered on core products,
from diagnostics to implementation, and from project
number and volume metrics to results metrics. Its two

 

main priority areas are simplifying regulations and
generating investment.

FIAS supports regulatory simplification by providing
advisory support to client governments on reforms, as well
as by offering in-depth assistance on regulatory governance,
licensing, tax simplification, trade logistics, and secured
lending. FIAS is leading an increasing number of successful Doing Business-related reform projects throughout the
world involving IFC facilities, the Bank, and other donors.
(See http://www. fias.net.]

IEG recently undertook an evaluation of the construction,
relevance, and use of the Doing Business indicators. IEG
found Doing Business successful in motivating policy debate
in countries but less successful as an aid in designing
policies. The Group found no evidence that the indicators
had distorted policy-making incentives in countries. It
recommended that the indicators be interpreted within the
country context, taking into consideration access to finance
and infrastructure, the labor market, and corruption, as
well as the level, type, and efficiency of regulations. To
enhance the confidence and credibility of the indicators,
IEG recommended recruiting more and more diverse
informants, disclosing the number of informants, and
increasing the transparency of the data.

Building Robust and Diverse Financial Sectors

The most important finance sector innovation of the fiscal
year was the launch of the Global Emerging Markets Local
Currency (Gemloc} bond program, approved by the Board in
October 2007. Gemloc combines the comparative advantages
of the Bank Group and the private sector to help develop
local currency bond markets through three complementary
efforts: a private sector investment manager that develops
investment strategies for local currency bond markets; a
new bond index (GEMX), based on market size and investability indicators; and Bank advisory services on reforms that
can facilitate the creation of strong local bond markets.

(See http://www.gemloc.org.]

Demand for participation in the Financial Sector
Assessment Program—a joint World Bank-International
Monetary Fund (IMF) program that helps countries identify
vulnerabilities in their financial systems and determine

AN INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GLOBALIZATION 23needed reforms—remained strong across countries at all
levels of development. Twenty-three countries and one regional
supervisory body received initial assessments or updates during
fiscal 2008, bringing the share of Bank and IMF members that
have participated or volunteered to do so to 75 percent.

The Bank took over management of the Financial Sector
Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative in fiscal 2008.
This $100 million multidonor grant program seeks to build
robust and diverse financial sectors in low- and middleincome countries. FIRST approved 30 projects, valued at
$8.06 million, in fiscal 2008; 34 percent of this funding went
to Africa.

IMPROVING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Corporate Governance and Capital Markets Advisory
Department led the development of a common approach
shared by the world’s leading development finance institutions for integrating corporate governance into due diligence
procedures. Thirty-one institutions signed the statement at
the fall 2007 meetings in Washington, DC. The department
also established a program for corporate governance code
development in the Middle East and North Africa, which
has fostered wide acceptance of the value of sound corporate governance practices for private sector growth in the
region.

Reducing the Cost of Remittances

The Bank provided support for ongoing reforms in payment,
remittance, and securities systems in more than 40 countries
in fiscal 2008. Its global payment system survey covers more
than 140 countries and 300 technical issues in payment,
remittance, and securities settlement. The survey results will
help Bank staff create indicators that can be used to support
advice to clients on payment system development. During
fiscal 2008, the Bank also launched a remittance price
database to monitor industry response to the release of international standards and provide a benchmark to consumers. The
goal is to help reduce the cost of remittances services,
potentially saving recipients in developing countries as much
as $12 billion a year.

EXPANDING MICROFINANCE PROGRAMS

The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), which
includes the Bank, advises and trains regulators and policy
makers around the world; governments such as Cambodia,
the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kosovo, the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic, and Malawi; and global standard-setters
such as the Basel Committee on issues related to access to
microfinance.

CGAP has led the charge globally on technology for access
to finance and “branchless banking” (indeed, CGAP coined the
term]. CGAP experts are working with regulators in 10 countries
to facilitiate peer learning on the cutting edge of policy challenges
created by the convergence of the communications and
financial services industries. The CGAP Technology Program
has projects under way in Kenya, Mongolia, Pakistan, the
Philippines, and South Africa, and uses new technologies
such as mobile phones and smart cards to provide 2 million
low-income people with financial services that can help
improve their lives. CGAP is also developing a model to
prepare the poorest people for microfinance and has launched
seven pilots in five countries—Ghana, Haiti, India, Pakistan,
and Peru—over the past year. (See http://www.cgap.org.]

MIGRATION AND REMITTANCES

The Bank's involvement in international migration increased
substantially over the past four years, with an expanded
research program, an increase in international consultations on
migration issues, and support for improved handling of remittances by client countries’ financial systems. In fiscal 2008 the
Bank published Migration and Remittances Factbook 2008 (also
available online]; an edited volume, The International Migration
of Women; and more than 25 working papers, including papers
on diaspora bonds and securitization of remittances.

Data sets covering high-skilled emigration and bilateral
migration and remittances were expanded in fiscal 2008. The
Bank also completed or is conducting surveys of migration
and remittance behavior at the household level in Brazil,
Ghana, India (Kerala), Samoa, Tajikistan, and Tonga; conducted a study of the Indonesia-Malaysia remittance corridor;
and initiated studies on the development implications ofhuman trafficking and a possible role for the Bank in preventing trafficking, and on the implications of climate change
for migration flows in Central America. Country assistance
strategies in many countries have discussed the implications
of large-scale migration. A fiscal 2008 country economic
memorandum for Kenya, for example, included recommendations for mobilizing the resources of the diaspora.

During fiscal 2008 the Bank continued to support refugees in
postconflict environments in Africa, facilitate temporary migration to more developed neighbors in the Pacific Islands, and
study how regional transport corridors can be used to control
HIV transmission in Sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, the Bank
continued its efforts to provide social protection to emigrants
through training, provision of information, and regulation of
recruitment as well as by strengthening health, education, and
incentives to reduce the impact of the brain drain.

IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF INTERNATIONAL STATISTICS
Because reliable statistics are essential for formulating
policy and measuring development progress, the Bank's
Development Data Group maintains several large international databases that provide key statistical information for
operational activities and support critical management

decisions. These data are compiled from a variety of sources,
including the United Nations and its specialized agencies, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,
the IMF, regional development banks, private organizations,
and national statistical offices. Adherence to internationally
accepted standards and norms results in a consistent,
reliable source of information.

To improve the quality of international statistics, the
Development Data Group works with its partners to improve
statistical methods, promote data collection activities,
compile global data sets, and help countries increase their
statistical capacity. Some of this work takes place through the
Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century
(PARIS21) and the International Comparison Program [ICP].
As one of the founding members, the Bank supports PARIS21
and provides financial support to countries through a Trust
Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB). As of July 2008,
72 projects had been approved for financing from TFSCB Il,
and seven for financing from TFSCB Ill. Of these, 40 are
active. (See http://www.paris21.org.}

The ICP is a worldwide statistical initiative that collects
comparative price data and estimates purchasing power
parities of the world’s economies. The program, which
involves partners from national, regional, and international

 

AN INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GLOBALIZATION 25agencies, analyzes data from 146 economies, making it the
largest statistical initiative in the world. It is overseen by
the World Bank.

The Bank makes development data available through
online databases and monitoring systems, such as those
used to measure progress toward the MDGs and IDA Results
Measurement System. (See http://www.worldbank.org/data.]

IMPACT EVALUATION

The Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) Initiative is a
Bank-wide collaborative effort involving thematic networks,
regional units, and the research group under the guidance of
the World Bank’s Chief Economist. Its three primary purposes
are to add to the number of World Bank-supported impact
evaluations, particularly in strategic areas; to increase the
ability of staff to design and carry out such evaluations in
close collaboration with government agencies in developing
countries; and to build a process of systematic learning on
effective development interventions based on lessons from
completed evaluations.

Through the combined efforts of DIME, regional initiatives
(for example, the African Impact Evaluation Initiative], and
sector-based strategies {such as the Human Development
Network], 158 impact evaluations are being conducted. In
comparison, a total of 106 impact evaluations were completed
by the World Bank between 1990 and 2007. DIME’s current list

26 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2008

of themes includes early childhood development, education
service delivery, conditional cash transfers, HIV/AIDS treatment
and prevention, local development, malaria control, pay-forperformance in health services, rural roads, rural electrification,
urban upgrading, and youth employment and service. (See
http://www.worldbank.org/dime.])

CIVIL SOCIETY

Bank relations with civil society continued to intensify as
reflected in the greater numbers of civil society organization
(CSO) representatives accredited to attend the Annual and
Spring Meetings during fiscal 2008. CSOs also increased their
involvement in the Civil Society Policy Forum by sponsoring
dialogue sessions on such issues as extractive industries,
climate change, and debt relief. Important policy consultations were held with civil society on country systems for
procurement and the strategic framework for climate change.
The Bank began the process of reviewing its approaches to
civil society engagement and policy consultation in order to
improve consistency and the quality of these interactions.
Bank-CSO relations continued to expand at the country level
through CSO participation in project appraisals (73 percent),
country assistance strategy consultations (91 percent}, and
Poverty Reduction Strategy participation (73 percent). [See
http://www.worldbank.org/civilsociety.]REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES 2WORLD BANK REGIONS, COUNTRY OFFICES, AND BORROWER ELIGIBILITY

The World Bank today operates out of more than 100 offices

the Bank to better understand, work more closely with, and
provide faster service to clients. Three-fourths of outstanding
loans are managed by country directors located away from the
Bank's Washington, DC, headquarters. Thirty-six percent of staff
are now based in country offices.

For more than a decade, Africa—still the Bank’s top priority—
has posted healthy growth. Its GDP has expanded at an
average rate of 5.4 percent a year. This rapid growth has been
fueled, on the one hand, by decisive and deft management

of the macroeconomy of a majority of countries and, on the
other hand, by more careful management of the global
commodities boom. As a result, Africa has become an
attractive investment destination for foreign capital, notably
in the oil, gas, and mining sectors. The upward trend has
awakened memories of the boom of the 1970s, leading to
calls on African countries to make sure that their current
fortune is not wasted, as it was then. Riots in several African
countries, triggered by rising fuel and food prices, have
served notice that growth must be inclusive—ensuring that
the poor participate in and benefit from its fruits—if the region
is to accelerate progress toward meeting the Millennium
Development Goals.

During fiscal 2008, the Bank expanded its support to African
countries eager to improve management of their natural
resources sector. The Bank has helped build their capacity to
secure just and fair deals when extraction concessions are
awarded, deepening transparency in the management of
revenues, and ensuring that revenue from the commodities
boom fuels sustainable development. Recognizing the potential
of agriculture to curb poverty, particularly in rural Africa, the

Bank scaled up support for the sector in fiscal 2008 and agreed
to increase lending for agriculture in Africa from $368 million in
fiscal 2008 to $650 million in fiscal 2009 and to $800 million in
fiscal 2010. The Bank also pursued regional solutions for
Africa’s most demanding development challenges: bridging the
infrastructure gap in the provision of the energy indispensable
for growing economies through initiatives such as the West
Africa Power Pool, and supporting Africa’s efforts to expand
intra-African trade through the expansion of transport corridors
and customs reform and harmonization. It boosted Africa’s
efforts to access global markets and to use new trade platforms
such as the Internet (under the East African Submarine Cable
System, for example] and funded efforts to combat HIV/AIDS,
malaria, tuberculosis, avian flu, and other pandemics.

WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE

The Bank—the world’s largest provider of development assistance to Africa—provided $5.7 billion in loans, credits, and grants
to Africa in fiscal 2008. The Bank approved 91 projects. It also
completed 108 economic and sector work activities and

80 nonlending technical assistance activities, many of which
focused on strengthening the commitment of countries to
reforms. Two African countries—the Central African Republic and
Liberia—reached the decision point {when debt relief is revocable) under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC]

Initiative in fiscal 2008. At completion point, they would benefit
from additional relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative.
Liberia benefited from interim debt relief estimated at $2.8 billion in nominal terms for an external public and publicly guaranteed debt estimated at $4.7 billion in net present value terms.
The nominal amount of HIPC debt relief provided to the Central
African Republic is estimated at $823 million. The country’s
public and publicly guaranteed external debt was estimated at
$1.1 billion. No African country reached the completion point
(when debt relief is irrevocable} under HIPC in fiscal 2008, and
none, therefore, benefited from the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative in fiscal 2008. Under that initiative, $37 billion in debt,
the bulk of it owed by African countries, will be written off over
the next 40 years for countries with sound financial management
and a commitment to poverty reduction. The Bank warned
predatory lenders in developed countries that it is working to
stop them from preying on the poor and reversing the benefits
achieved through debt relief initiatives.

In response to the food crisis, the Bank provided $10 million
in three special financing projects to help some of the most
vulnerable countries cope with rising prices in fiscal 2008.
It engaged more than 40 countries in policy discussions
on the crisis.

COMBATING DISEASE

To address pandemics, the Bank expanded funding to several
landmark regional projects, including the Great Lakes
Initiative on AIDS Support Project, the Inter-Governmental
Authority on Development HIV/AIDS Partnership Program
Support Project, the Regional HIV/AIDS Treatment
Acceleration Project, and the Senegal River Basin Water
Resource Development Project {malaria}. It also established a
new agenda for action in preventing and dealing with the
consequences of HIV/AIDS through 2011 {see http://www
-worldbank.org/afr/aids). Through its booster program for
malaria control in Africa, the Bank committed about

$470 million in IDA resources and trust funds to Sub-Saharan
Africa from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2008—more than nine times
the volume of resources committed between 2000 and 2005.

The funds will be used to purchase and distribute more than
21 million long-lasting insecticidal bed nets, provide more
than 42 million doses of artemisinin-based combination
therapy, support indoor residual spraying, and strengthen
health systems.

SLOW BUT CERTAIN PROGRESS

Over the past decade, Africa has shown that it can expand and
sustain economic growth. It now needs to reduce income
disparities by sharing the fruits of growth more equitably
through policies that pullin the poor—particularly rural
dwellers, women, and youth.

Deficiencies in infrastructure—as measured by limited
roads, power shortages, and inefficient ports, among other
things—remain a major challenge, stifling the continent's
capacity to compete in world markets and raising the costs
of doing business globally. Export costs in Africa account
for 18-35 percent of total costs; in China, by contrast, they
represent just 8 percent.

Recognizing the challenge of working in a continent prone
to conflict, the Bank Group adopted a new Rapid Response
Policy in fiscal 2008, under which the Bank can swiftly deliver

assistance to countries emerging from or severely affected by
conflicts or disasters. Through a $250 million Forest Carbon
Partnership Facility, the Bank encourages investment to stop
deforestation and minimize the negative impact of climate
change in return for access to carbon credits. In fiscal 2008, the
Bank launched the Lighting Africa Plan, which seeks to provide
inexpensive, safe, and cleaner lighting to 250 million people.
The Independent Evaluation Group's new report, The
Welfare Impact of Rural Electrification, confirmed the benefits
are significant enough to justify the investment. The evaluation also shows, however, that the larger share of benefits
from rural electrification continue to be captured by the
nonpoor, although the gap is closing with the expansion of
electrification. Two factors explain this pattern: which communities get connected and which households can afford the
connection once the grid is available. By not enabling poorer
households to connect to the grid, and by not providing
information to consumers so they obtain their maximum
benefit, the potential benefits of providing electricity to the

32 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2008

poor are not being fully realized. Moreover, households
themselves are willing to pay for these benefits, so grid
extension into rural areas can be financially viable. The Bank
is starting to investigate “smart subsidies” of the sort already
used for off-grid electrification programs (such as solar home
systems]. However, IEG’s report shows that the costs of offgrid electrification are higher than those of grid extension,
and the benefits less. Directing funds to connection subsidies
for grid extension can reach more poor people at lower cost.
The Bank will continue to support initiatives like these to
ensure that aid is effective, predictable, and supportive of
results-oriented, country-led programs. It will continue to help
minimize transaction costs, in keeping with the March 2005
Paris Declaration. Toward that end, in fiscal 2008 the Bank
approved a major simplification of and reduction in loan
charges for the 79 creditworthy low- and middle-income
countries that are clients and shareholders of IBRD. The move
has returned loan pricings to the levels in effect before the
price increases of 1998. (See http://www.worldbank.org/afr.)TABLE 2.1

REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES

33EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC

    

Growth in the low- and middle-income economies of the East

Asia and Pacific region picked up from 9.8 percent in 2006 to
10.2 percent in 2007, but was expected to decline by up to

2 percentage points in 2008 because of the global slowdown.
Nonetheless, sustained growth and propoor policies have
produced dramatic reductions in poverty in many of the
Bank's client countries in the region. In 2007, the proportion
of poor people [with consumption below $2 a day] fell to

25 percent, compared with 69 percent in 1990. For the region's
fast-growing countries, growth has been accompanied by
exceptionally rapid urbanization. By 2025, the region's urban
population is likely to increase by 500 million people, or

68 percent, placing stress on urban infrastructure and
increasing the need for social safety nets.

While many countries in the region have reached, or will
soon reach, the human development targets set under the
Millennium Development Goals, stark differences between
countries remain. Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam
still have to catch up with some of the wealthier middleincome countries, while Cambodia, the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic, Timor-Leste, and some fragile Pacific
Island economies may fall short of some of the 2015 targets.

Most East Asian countries are well positioned to navigate
the global slowdown because of investments made in structural reforms in the past 10 years, but the food price crisis

and climbing oil prices have dealt a blow to poor people ina
number of the region's client countries. The Bank is advising
several client countries in the region on safety nets for protecting the poorest people and on policy of directions for securing
rice supplies, expanding sources of renewable energy, and
mitigating the short-term impact of high oil prices.

WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE
The Bank in fiscal 2008 adopted a new strategy for the region
that reflects the evolving challenges of such a diverse range
of economies. It focuses on scaling up the Bank Group's
engagement to address the changing demands of middleincome countries while also working to support countries
dealing with fragility and conflict.

In fiscal 2008, the Bank delivered $4.5 billion in lending
for the region, including $2.7 billion in IBRD loans and
$1.8 billion in IDA credits and grants.

migration. A $200 million development policy loan to
Indonesia is designed specifically to support policy reforms in
the country’s infrastructure sector. It is helping the government to map infrastructure needs across sectors and regions
and pursue reforms that will benefit people with the lowest
access to infrastructure. In China, where energy demand is
almost outstripping supply, a $200 million loan will help
catalyze large-scale domestic financing to increase the
efficiency of energy-intensive industries, while a $191 million
loan in Liaoning Province will finance a project to demonstrate energy efficiency and environmental performance of
heating and gas services in selected cities. In Vietnam, a
$155 million IDA credit and a $9.8 million grant from the
Global Environment Facility are helping the city of Hanoi

to improve urban air quality and expand its mass transit
public transport system. Meanwhile, a $50 million Bank

loan is supporting government efforts in China to help
millions of rural migrants to shift into urban employment
through skills development programs and social

protection schemes.

A DUAL CHALLENGE FROM CLIMATE CHANGE

In a region that both contributes to global greenhouse
emissions and is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate
change, the Bank is working on many fronts. A climate
change and disaster risk management strategy is being
developed for Papua New Guinea, and, with support from the
Global Environment Facility and the Global Fund for Disaster
Relief and Rehabilitation, the Bank is helping six Pacific
Island countries to draw up plans for adapting to potential
impacts from climate change. In China, five major carbontrade agreements are bringing financial resources to support
the introduction of cleaner technology in the steel sector,
innovations in biogas reduction from agriculture, and broader
use of lower-carbon liquefied natural gas. At the same time,
the Bank is working with China to reduce greenhouse
emissions by improving energy efficiency, restoring forests,
and investing in renewable sources of energy. In Indonesia,

a major agreement, brokered by the Bank, provides local
government with credits for preventing around 250,000 tons of

transparent management of the country’s natural resources
and revenue stream at the top of its priority list. Through a
$17 million loan, the Bank is supporting the country’s work to
strengthen governance and accountability in mining sector
institutions and to empower local people in mining communities to monitor the delivery of programs and services. In
Mongolia, which is on the verge of a major minerals boom,
the Bank is supporting the government to implement the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and is finalizing
preparation of an IDA project to help the government set up
an appropriate financial and regulatory framework for
managing the mining and extractive industries sector in an
environmentally sustainable and transparent way.

Communities across Indonesia are being empowered to
oversee and manage their own development plans through
the government's National Community Empowerment
Program. Two Bank-supported urban and rural poverty
reduction interventions worth a total of $409 million (of which
over $315 million is on IDA terms] will support the government's effort to reach all of Indonesia's 70,000 villages with
the community-driven and -monitored service delivery
program. Meanwhile in Cambodia, a new Poverty Reduction
and Growth Operation, supported by a $15 million IDA grant,
focuses on improving public financial management.

ADDRESSING FRAGILITY AND

IMPROVING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

As Timor-Leste emerges from a recent series of security and
political setbacks, the Bank is working with its donor partners
on key areas of immediate priority: improving health services,
and building skills and employment opportunities for the
country’s large youth population. A Bank study, “Timor-Leste’s
Youth in Crisis,” recommended six priority actions aimed at
empowering young people and expanding job opportunities.

At the end of the fiscal year, an IDA grant was being
prepared to support the government's effort to bring

young people, especially in urban areas, into mainstream
employment. Another Bank study, “Opportunities to Improve
Social Services: Human Development in the Pacific Islands,”
also highlights the challenges to growth and development
posed by increasing numbers of youth and rising male
unemployment. In Indonesia, an $86 million Bank loan is
supporting the government's effort to upgrade the qualifications of over 1.4 million teachers and create world-class
educational institutions. Meanwhile, a new Bank-supported
rural health program in China will test new ideas and
approaches for broadening rural people's access to quality
health services.

BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS AND EXCHANGING KNOWLEDGE
The Bank is working closely with the China Export-Import
Bank to bring China’s development experience to other
developing countries through staff exchanges and joint pilot
projects in Africa. Anew Bank-managed trust fund worth

$15 million, provided by the Republic of Korea, is helping East
Asian countries fight poverty and deliver government services
more effectively. And a $37 million Infrastructure for Growth
trust fund provided by the Australian government is supporting the Bank’s analytical studies, policy dialogue, and investment projects in energy, transport, water and sanitation,
telecommunications, infrastructure finance, and urban
development. In partnership with the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Bank is holding a series of
dialogues with renowned Asian leaders on their views of
development. The “Catalysts of Change” series connects 12
sites via video across the Asia Pacific through the Global
Development Learning Network and has featured high-profile
regional personalities. (See http://www.worldbank.org/eap.}TABLE 2.2

REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES

37LOL LN

   

South Asia has experienced rapid economic growth, declining
poverty, and progress in human development for more than
a decade. As a result, for the first time in its history, the
region with the world’s largest concentration of poor people
has a real chance of ending mass poverty in a generation.
Thanks to the economic reforms of the past two decades,
annual GDP growth in the region has averaged 6 percent
since 2000. This growth has translated into a significant drop
in poverty rates across the subcontinent. In the next decade,
South Asia is expected to contribute more to global poverty
reduction than any other region. If it can accelerate growth
to 8-10 percent a year and sustain it, it can reduce income
poverty to the single digits.

Rapid growth alone will not necessarily end poverty,
however. Economic growth has been accompanied by rising
inequality, and the region continues to suffer from some of
the worst levels of human deprivation in the world.
Corruption, confrontational politics, and conflict threaten to
derail the process of economic development. The region has
also been hard hit by the recent increase in world food prices,
especially for rice and wheat, the two main staples in South
Asia. To address all of these issues, the World Bank's strategy
for South Asia comprises three pillars—accelerating and
sustaining growth, making development inclusive, and

Afghanistan

strengthening human development—and the cross-cutting
theme of improved governance.

The Bank's program also reflects an emerging new reality:
South Asia can no longer be characterized as a uniformly
low-income region. Growth is propelling several Indian states,
along with Bhutan, Maldives, and parts of Sri Lanka, into
middle-income status. At the same time, per capita incomes
and human development indicators in Bangladesh, Nepal,
most of Pakistan, and the lagging regions of India and
Sri Lanka are those of low-income countries. In addition,
some 71 million South Asians live in conflict, and violence is
escalating in Afghanistan, northern Sri Lanka, and parts of
India and Pakistan. In recognition of the diverse needs of the
region, the Bank is differentiating its engagement. In education, for example, the Bank is working with partners
to improve quality in aspiring middle-income countries
and states, while in low-income countries and states, its
focus is on increasing both access to and the quality of
primary schools.

WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE

The Bank approved nearly $4.3 billion for South Asia in fiscal
2008, $1.5 billion in loans from IBRD and $2.8 billion in IDA
credits and grants.

An important component of the Bank’s strategy is its
analytic and advisory work. A recent report on gender in
Bangladesh documented significant improvements in gender
equality and women’s status while pointing to the need to
increase female participation in the labor force and give
women greater voice in society. A study on education in
Punjab, Pakistan, concluded that the dramatic increase in
private schools requires policy makers to reexamine education policies. The Bank also published a report proposing
economic incentives and development initiatives to reduce
opium production in Afghanistan, conducted a study on labor
issues in India, and performed an environmental assessment
in Pakistan.

SUPPORTING LAGGING REGIONS AND SECTORS
In recent years, the Bank has sharpened its focus to ensure
that lagging regions such as Bihar in India and Baluchistan
Province in Pakistan, sectors such as agriculture, and groups
such as women and disadvantaged minorities participate in
growth. Inclusion is critical if the lives of the region's 400 million poor people are to improve. In fiscal 2008, the Bank
approved a $225 million loan/credit to the state of Bihar to
support implementation of critical structural reforms for
attaining sustainable and inclusive development while
improving the delivery of key public services.

About 1 billion people live in rural areas in South Asia. As
a result, the region's economy depends on agriculture—and
hence irrigation—more than any other region in the world.
The Bank provides assistance to South Asian governments
in many aspects of the management of water resources,
including watersheds, groundwater, international waters such
as the Indus Waters Treaty, and river basins. In fiscal 2008,
the Bank approved a $150 million credit to enhance water
distribution in Pakistan’s Sindh Province. In neighboring
Baluchistan, it approved a $25 million credit to boost agricultural production and improve the use of water in irrigation. In
Bangladesh, it supported a $62.6 million project to improve
agricultural productivity and farm income by revitalizing the
national agricultural technology system.

ENSURING SERVICE DELIVERY AMID ARMED CONFLICT
Continuing its support for developing Afghanistan's rural
economy and improving rural livelihoods, the Bank provided
$250 million in grants to improve access to basic services,
increase equitable access to quality basic education, expand
microfinance services, and help curb the spread of HIV/AIDS.
It also supported a program of contracting out health services
to nongovernmental organizations, increasing the number of
people with access to health care by some 6 million.

STRENGTHENING INFRASTRUCTURE

The Bank is working to address South Asia's vast urban and
rural infrastructure deficits, often cited as the greatest constraint to foreign investment. Half of the region's population
still lacks access to electricity. To help address the problem,
he Bank provided a $400 million loan for the Rampur
Hydropower Project in the state of Himachal Pradesh that will
provide renewable, low-carbon energy to India's overstretched
northern electricity grid. It also extended a $600 million loan to
he Power Grid Corporation of India, backed by a guarantee
rom the government of India, designed to increase reliable
power exchange between regions and states.

MAKING DEVELOPMENT INCLUSIVE
The Bank has innovated and scaled up rural livelihood and
empowerment programs that provide microfinance, access to
markets, and self-employment opportunities to millions of
poor people, especially women and marginalized groups. In
iscal 2008, it extended its largest support package to Nepal,
providing $253 million in IDA grants, $100 million of which
were allocated to the second phase of the Poverty Alleviation
Fund, which has reached more than 900,000 rural Nepalese
in 25 districts. Thanks to this program, more than 15,600
households now have access to paved roads for the first time,
and more than 32,000 new households now have access to
water supply, bridges, and sanitation.

Some 10,000 community infrastructure projects have been
completed under the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund,
touching the lives of more than 2.5 million people in about

5,000 villages. More than half of these projects provide safe
drinking water or access to safe sanitation. In fiscal 2008, the
fund received additional financing of $75 million from the Bank
to mobilize 5 million people in 25 of the country’s poorest
districts into community organizations and local support
organizations.

In Andhra Pradesh, India, Bank-funded projects have
helped some 8 million women build incomes, improve living
standards, and gain political influence by banding together in
some 630,000 self-help groups. The Bank continued its
support of this program in fiscal 2008 by providing $65 million
to finance critical investments in institution and capacity
building that will allow community institutions of poor women
to become sustainable and self-reliant.

RESPONDING TO CLIMATE CHANGE

Few regions in the world are at greater risk from climate
change than South Asia. The 2007 floods in Bangladesh, India,
and Nepal, which claimed several thousand lives, were a
reminder that climate change is already beginning to have an
impact. The Bank's response has been to significantly scale
up its activity on adapting to and mitigating climate change. It
is providing assistance and advocacy for national programs in
urban development, rural areas, coastal zone, and ecosystem
management. It is also embarking on a long-term program
to strengthen water cooperation among Bangladesh, India,
and Nepal for flood control and hydropower generation.
Cooperation among Bangladesh, India, and Nepal on flood
mitigation could benefit 400 million people.

Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries in
the world to extreme weather events. The Bank is working
with various partners to help develop a major disaster
preparedness program for the country. In fiscal 2008, the
Bank helped Bangladesh recover from the dual shocks of
the August flooding and the November cyclone by approving
$245 million for flood and cyclone response, $175 million
of which was quick disbursing. Total World Bank assistance
to Bangladesh for flood and cyclone relief is expected to
exceed $400 million.

IMPROVING GOVERNANCE
Governance lies at the heart of the Bank’s work in South Asia.
Over the past five years, it has been working with client
countries at the economy, sector, and project levels to
strengthen governance, increase public accountability for
results, and mitigate corruption. The Governance Country
Assistance Strategy for Bangladesh and governance reforms
in irrigation, the financial sector, and education in Pakistan
are two examples.

The January 2008 India Detailed Implementation Review,
which revealed serious indicators of fraud and corruption
in five Bank-financed health projects in India, has implications for how the Bank promotes better governance—in
country systems and within Bank-financed operations. The
Bank's response to the review seeks to straddle the twin
challenges of strengthening country systems while
enhancing the Bank’s own supervision framework. (See

REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES AlThe Europe and Central Asia region enjoyed robust economic
growth of 6.7 percent in 2007, continuing the strong growth and
poverty reduction it has experienced since the mid-1990s.
Nearly 50 million of the region's 480 million people moved out
of poverty between 1999 and 2006. Large gains in productivity—

the result of continued enterprise restructuring, technology
diffusion, and double-digit growth in investment (supported
by rapid credit expansion through lending by domestic and
foreign banks]—as well as increased hydrocarbon production
have driven rapid growth in some of the region's countries.
Along with strong growth in remittance inflows in many countries, these factors have also boosted private consumption.
Despite these gains, by the end of 2006, some 180 million
people—more than a third of the region's population—continued to subsist on less than $2.15 a day (the definition of poverty
in this region because of the additional expenditures for heating
and warm clothing necessitated by the cold climate], and
millions more were living on less than $4.30 a day (the portion
of the population that is “economically vulnerable” and could
become poor in the event of an economic downturn].
Rising food and energy prices have complicated the
conduct of macroeconomic management across the region.
In 2007, food prices rose about 12 percent in Central and
Eastern Europe and nearly 20 percent in the Commonwealth

8 percent in Central and Eastern Europe, 18 percent in
middle-income CIS countries, and more than 30 percent in
low-income CIS countries. Overall, inflation concerns are
back on the front burner for policy makers in the region, as
the CIS countries are now facing an average of 13.4 percent
and the Central and Eastern European countries 6.1 percent
in inflationary pressures.

WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE

The Bank approved a total of 47 IBRD/IDA projects for

$4.2 billion in the region, including two food-crisis responses
(one regular project and one additional financing) in the Kyrgyz
Republic. In addition, the Bank approved one special financing
operation and one special financing—additional financing in
Tajikistan to respond to the food crisis. The Bank also completed 80 economic and sector work activities and delivered
88 nonlending technical assistance activities focusing on
building country capacity. The Bank’s newest flagship report
on the region, Unleashing Prosperity: Productivity Growth in
Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union, emphasizes
the importance of continued policy reform—particularly in
infrastructure, finance, and institutional quality—for
increasing economic productivity, which drives growth.

Regional initiatives are particularly important to counries that have their sights set on joining the European
Union (EU). The Bank is supporting the Energy Community
of Southeastern Europe, which is establishing a market
o share energy efficiently. Albania, Croatia, the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Serbia are part of
his effort.

USING A DIFFERENTIATED BUSINESS MODEL

The Bank supports poor countries and fragile states in a
number of ways, including by decentralizing more staff to
ocations where capacity constraints are severe and by helping
with donor coordination, harmonization, and alignment. On
he other hand, Europe and Central Asia’s middle-income
countries, given their diversity, also receive tailored support.
For example, in lower-middle-income countries, investment
climate issues are important and require Bank assistance,
while in resource-rich countries, the Bank provides support
or diversifying the economic base of clients. In EU-candidate
countries, the Bank supports the EU accession agenda,
whereas in new EU member states, the Bank supports
countries in their aim to achieve convergence with EU
average income levels.

 

IMPROVING INFRASTRUCTURE

The Bank extended several loans for infrastructure in the
region. Among these were $200 million to improve housing in
the Russian Federation, $450 million for railroad rehabilitation
in Azerbaijan, $200 million to improve power transmission in
Ukraine, $105 million to improve regional and local roads in
FYR Macedonia, and $140 million to improve urban infrastructure in Ukraine.

CREATING AN ATTRACTIVE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
Structural reforms in most countries have driven the region's
ongoing success in creating an attractive business climate.
Europe and Central Asia is reforming more rapidly than any
other region in the world, surpassing even East Asia in terms

of the ease of doing business. Four countries (Croatia, FYR
Macedonia, Georgia, and Bulgaria] were among the top
10 reformers worldwide in 2007.

In November 2007, the World Bank opened the Centre for
Financial Reporting Reform in Vienna. Its goal is to help
countries, primarily in Southeast Europe and the new EU
member states, to enhance the quality of financial reporting
standards in order to improve their investment climates.

STRENGTHENING THE LEGAL,

INSTITUTIONAL, AND STRUCTURAL FRAMEWORK

The Bank approved a $400 million Public Sector Development
Policy Loan to Turkey to support a sustained medium-term
process of legal, institutional, and structural development

via improved quality of fiscal adjustment as well as social
protection through pension reform, implementation of
administrative reforms intended to strengthen administrative
capacity, and support of efficiency-increasing and cost-saving
measures in the health system to sustain implementation of
the Public Financial Management and Control Law. The law
has underpinned the outstanding improvements in Turkey's
public expenditure management system.

IMPROVING GOVERNANCE AND FIGHTING CORRUPTION
The Bank continues to work with the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development in conducting the Business
Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS).
BEEPS data have been used in studies of corruption, judicial
systems, and other areas. These data provided the backbone
for the Anticorruption in Transition series of studies as well as
for Judicial Systems in Transition Economies. Both studies
monitor changes over time to gain insights into what is
working and what challenges, notably corruption, remain in
areas that affect the business environment.

ADDRESSING GLOBAL AND REGIONAL ISSUES

The Bank is also addressing a few broad strategic themes,
such as climate change and energy, at the regional level by

building up its stock of knowledge and expertise and then

and advisory services, the Bank is also increasingly supporting activities on energy efficiency, cleaner production, and
waste management.

DEVELOPING LIFETIME SKILLS
After the political and economic transitions of the past,
countries in the region now face a third transition: aging

 

populations, which will lead to a declining working-age
population and the challenge of how to pay for the necessary
social safety nets while dealing with development progress.
The region produced a flagship study, Red to Gray: The “Third
Transition” of Aging Populations in Eastern Europe and the
Former Soviet Union, that sets the analytical basis for policy
reforms that should help client countries deal with issues
from pension policies to technology absorption and innovation. (See http://www.worldbank.org/eca.])

IMPROVING THE LIVES OF PEOPLE IN EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA

 

The Bank held its first annual “Improving the Lives of
People in ECA: A Week of Celebration and Learning” in
March 2008. Awards of recognition were granted to 22
Bank activities, including projects for improving dam

safety in Armenia, increasing access to health services

in the Kyrgyz Republic, providing higher-quality education
for rural students in Romania, and restoring the
Northern Aral Sea.

REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES

45LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN

   

In 2007, the Latin America and the Caribbean region marked
a fourth straight year of growth in excess of 5 percent—its
healthiest spurt since the 1970s. Governments in the region
have put in place solid macroeconomic policies and have
taken advantage of favorable external developments to reduce
vulnerabilities. Financial markets are recognizing the region's
stronger economic and fiscal position. Brazil and Peru joined
Chile and Mexico this year in achieving investment grade.

Poverty rates have fallen, albeit modestly. These declines
are linked to the steady economic growth of the past few
years coupled with more propoor public expenditures,
including targeted cash transfer programs. The challenge for
the region today is to sustain growth and continue to provide
economic and social opportunities for all while facing a less
favorable global environment. Of most concern in the immediate term is management of the impacts of the twin challenges
of the economic slowdown in the United States and rising fuel
and food prices.

The rising global price of food, fuel, and other commodities
is having differing effects across and within countries. In
broad terms, the boom in commodity and agricultural prices
benefits South America but hurts countries in Central
America and the Caribbean (with the exception of Trinidad and
Tobago). Within countries—especially net importers—food

and fuel are especially sensitive and their rising costs are
causing sociopolitical stress. Declining remittances from abroad
could also reduce growth and negatively affect antipoverty
strategies, especially in Mexico and Central America.

WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE
The Bank's strategic partnership with Latin America and the
Caribbean focuses on achieving broad-based, sustainable
growth to reduce poverty and inequality. Although this goal
applies to all countries in the region, the diversity of the
countries means that priorities and solutions are tailored
carefully to individual circumstances. For middle-income
countries, the Bank offers an integrated package of services,
including analytic advice, technical assistance, policy dialogue, new customized financial products, and a platform for
global issues management such as trade and climate change.
For low-income countries, it provides concessional financing,
donor coordination, and specialized support for fragile states.
In fiscal year 2008, World Bank financing for Latin America
and the Caribbean reached $4.7 billion, with $4.4 billion
in loans from IBRD and $0.3 billion in credits from IDA.
Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico were the largest borrowers.
Transportation, public administration and law, and education
were the largest sectors. The region was responsible for

WORKING WITH THE POOREST COUNTRIES

In December 2007, donor countries—including for the first
time Brazil and Mexico—pledged a record $25.2 billion to the
World Bank to help overcome poverty in the world’s poorest
countries. Part of these resources will support the Bank’s
ongoing efforts in five IDA countries in the region: Bolivia,
Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, and Nicaragua.

Special resources are being devoted to Haiti, which has
recently emerged from civil conflict. In May, the Board
approved a $10 million grant from the newly introduced
Fast-Track Food Facility to help Haiti respond to the food price
crisis and to support implementation of the country’s poverty
reduction strategy.

Nicaragua will receive funding and debt relief under a new,
five-year strategy. The strategy calls for $240 million in IDA
assistance aimed at spurring economic development; enhancing productivity and increasing competitiveness; building
human capital; and developing state institutions that will
strengthen governance, accountability, and citizen participation
in government. The World Bank's Debt Reduction Facility also
is supporting a $1.4 billion cash buyback of Nicaragua's
external commercial debt.

SUPPORTING THE MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES’ AGENDA
In March 2008, Colombia became the first country to benefit
from a new Bank policy that significantly extends loan
maturities; Board approval of a $300 million loan with

longer maturities will help the country match the terms of
student loans with its borrowings from the Bank and thus will
support Colombia’s efforts to finance higher education for
low-income students.

Supporting the efforts of middle-income countries to
address global issues in individual country contexts has also
been an important priority. In fiscal 2008, the Bank approved a
Development Policy Loan for $501 million to support Mexico's

efforts under its National Climate Change Strategy to mainstream climate change considerations in public policy. The
loan is designed to decrease the adverse environmental
impacts of greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations on
a voluntary basis in key sectors.

PROVIDING TIMELY ANALYSIS,

SHARING KNOWLEDGE

Latin America is the region that receives the largest volume of
remittances, estimated at about $40 billion in 2007. To better
understand the impact of remittances, the region produced a
report, Remittances and Development: Lessons from Latin
America, which shows that the money migrant workers send
back to their home countries is linked to lower poverty levels
and improvements in education and health indicators.
Remittances also contribute to higher growth and investment
and are associated with lower economic volatility. Because
remittance income is equivalent to 10-20 percent of GDP in
many small countries in the Caribbean and Central America
and to 3-10 percent in some larger ones (Colombia, Ecuador,
Mexico}, the economic slowdown in the United States could
adversely affect poverty, particularly among recipient
households.

BOOSTING GROWTH AND JOB CREATION
The Bank continued to support innovative programs in the
region to stimulate the investment and competitiveness that
sustain high rates of economic growth and job creation. The
overriding priority over the medium- and long-term for the
region is to maintain growth by creating quality jobs for a larger
proportion of the population and by increasing productivity.
Examples of work in this area include policy advice on
reducing costs of freight transport and logistics services for
Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and El Salvador; a regional
hydro-energy investment feasibility study for Central
America; agricultural technology and research projects in
Nicaragua and Peru; youth employment programs in the
Caribbean and Honduras; labor markets analytical and

BRIDGING THE SOCIAL GAP

Creating equal opportunities for all citizens is crucial to
reducing the social divide in Latin America and the Caribbean.
The World Bank is working with countries across the region to
develop universal and affordable social protection; to support
programs that reduce poverty directly; and to increase access
to education, health, and public infrastructure. Major new
lending in fiscal 2008 included $83 million to the Brazil
Family Health Extension program to train family health care
workers to provide basic health care to urban residents, a
$15.7 million grant to the Haiti Community Driven Development
Project, and an $18.5 million IDA loan to Bolivia to expand the
quality and coverage of health care services to women and
children. The Bank also provided support in this area through
a major regional study on youth at risk.

STRENGTHENING GOVERNANCE

The World Bank is helping countries in Latin America and the
Caribbean develop effective and sustainable ways to promote
good governance and transparency through the strengthening
of country systems, improving accountability for service delivery,
and monitoring and evaluating results. In Guatemala, the Bank
is continuing to support government efforts to increase transparency in public procurement and fiscal management with

a $100 million development policy loan. In Mexico, the Bank

48 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2008

is supporting an ongoing effort to implement, administer, and
publicize the country’s Freedom of Information Act, one of the
first laws of its kind in Latin America.

LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD ON GLOBAL ISSUES
Countries in the region are emerging as key players on issues
of global concern, and the Bank's role has been to support
their efforts by partnering through innovative platforms for an
enlightened dialogue and action on the ground, as well as by
supporting South-South cooperation.

In February 2008, more than 100 legislators from the Group
of Eight (G8) countries and five emerging economies (Brazil,
China, India, Mexico, and South Africa] gathered in Brasilia to
participate in a major international forum on climate change,
the GLOBE G8+5 Legislators Forum. Participating lawmakers
discussed and agreed on a Post-2012 Climate Change
Framework and a Bio-Fuels Statement.

The Bank has been working closely with the World Trade
Organization on the Aid for Trade agenda and has participated
in several subregional gatherings that addressed the competitiveness challenges facing the region.

Along with other partners, the Bank participated in The
Lancet’s series on maternal and child undernutrition, which
was launched in Lima, Peru, in February 2008. The meeting,
cohosted by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Johns
Hopkins University, highlighted the urgent need to address
malnutrition in such countries as Bolivia, Guatemala,
Nicaragua, and Peru. (See http://www.worldbank.org/lac.]TABLE 2.5

REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES

49MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH
i | Rah AC

For the fifth consecutive year, the Middle East and North Africa
region experienced strong economic growth, with real GDP
increasing 5.7 percent in 2007. Growth was almost evenly
distributed between the resource-rich and resource-poor
economies in the region. As a result of skyrocketing global oil
prices, the region’s export revenues increased 11.6 percent in
2007, reaching $632 billion. The food crisis has hit the region,
a net food importer, hard.

WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE

The Bank committed $1.5 billion in loans, credits, and grants
to the region in fiscal 2008. The Bank is providing technical
support and emergency financial assistance to Djibouti and
the Republic of Yemen to help them respond to the food
crisis. In countries with ample food reserves and access to
capital markets, it is providing advice on agriculture and

food policies.

The Bank delivered 44 economic and sector work activities
and 85 nonlending technical assistance activities in fiscal
2008. This work included a public expenditure review of Iraq,
a development policy review and country financial accountability assessment of the Arab Republic of Egypt, a gender
assessment for Lebanon, a policy note on women and microfinance in Iraq, a report on women workers and competitiveness

in Egypt, and several regional reports focusing on public
financial management. The Bank also launched a flagship
report on education in the region, The Road Not Traveled,
which emphasizes the central role of incentives and public
accountability in increasing the effectiveness of reform
efforts and meeting sector goals. Work also began on the
Arab World Initiative [see box 2.2).

IMPROVING EDUCATION AND TRAINING

AND REDUCING YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT

The Bank is implementing a significant portfolio of activities
that seek to increase access to education, lift quality, and
provide market-relevant skills to graduates. In fiscal 2008, the
Bank approved a $20 million credit to the Republic of Yemen
to improve secondary education and increase girls’ access. It
also approved a $7.5 million loan to Jordan that will focus on
strengthening skills for development. The MNA Education
Flagship Report was launched during the year. It has already
had significant impact: its message on the need for higher
quality education and greater accountability of education
systems reverberated throughout the region. A Regional PISA
Analysis and the Syria Education Strategy furthered this
important agenda. Technical assistance and policy advice
complement an active lending program.

To address the continued problem of youth unemployment,
the Bank completed a regional policy note on youth and
conducted several dissemination and consultation events in
the region in fiscal 2008. In Egypt, a pilot project addressing
child labor and school dropout interventions resulted ina
national high-level workshop to review policies in this area.
The Bank is also conducting similar activities to incorporate
gender concerns in Bank operations and to enhance women’s
participation in public life.

SUPPORTING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

AND MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES

Half of the region's population lives under conditions of water
stress—and rapid population growth and climate change will
further constrict the availability of water. To address the
problem, the Bank is stepping up its activities in the sector and
deepening sector policy dialogue. About half of all commitments to the water sector in the region focus on water supply
and sanitation, with the other half supporting water resource
management, irrigation, and related fields. Analytical work and
country water assistance strategies have been prepared or are
under way in most countries in the region.

IMPROVING GOVERNANCE

Governance and administrative reform have moved to the
forefront of the development debate in the region. Core
issues are the size of the public sector, the lack of adequate
transparency and accountability, the mixed quality of regulation, the variable levels of service delivery, and the limited
voice for civil society. In response to these challenges, the
Bank is supporting governance aspects of public financial
management and civil service reform in Iraq, Morocco, the
West Bank and Gaza, and the Republic of Yemen. It is providing
analytical services and technical assistance in anticorruption,
fiscal federalism and decentralization, demand-side governance, and right-to-information legislation. The Bank has
conducted Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
assessments in most countries in the region, and it is currently

conducting country governance and anticorruption assessments
in lrag, Lebanon, and the Republic of Yemen. It has also
increased the use of its standard fiduciary evaluation tools at
the project level.

FOSTERING PRIVATE SECTOR AND

FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

During fiscal 2008, the Bank approved a $500 million loan

to support Egypt's financial sector reform program; a

$51 million institutional reform grant to the Republic of
Yemen, a large component of which addresses enhancing the
business environment; and a $6 million loan to support the
development of exports in Tunisia. It conducted investment
climate assessments or updates in Algeria, Egypt, Jordan,
Lebanon, Morocco, the West Bank and Gaza, and the Republic
of Yemen and performed advisory work on industrial land
reform and industrial land markets, fiscal reforms, access to
inance, and the business regulatory environment in Egypt,
Morocco, and the Republic of Yemen. Private and financial
sector development also constitutes an important element of
ee-based programs in Libya and the Gulf Cooperation Council
countries.

Efforts to improve the business environment continued in
2007, with 59 percent of the region's countries instituting at
east one positive reform. Egypt and Saudi Arabia ranked
among the world’s top reformers.

ASSISTING PEOPLE IN CONFLICT-AFFECTED COUNTRIES
The Bank remains active in Iraq, Lebanon, and the West
Bank and Gaza. In Iraq, it manages a portfolio of more than
800 million. Activities focus on strengthening service
delivery in a broad range of sectors and assisting the
government in its efforts to improve its public financial
management. The Bank is also working to improve the
ivelihoods of displaced Iraqis in the Syrian Arab Republic,
Lebanon, and Jordan and to enhance their integration with
surrounding communities. In Lebanon, the Bank scaled up
its technical and financial assistance in support of the

The Bank’s portfolio in the West Bank and Gaza includes

13 projects whose goals are to improve the living conditions
for Palestinian people, such as water and sanitation,
education, and municipal finance. In fiscal 2008, the Bank
approved $40 million in budget support as part of a package
of donor support for the Palestinian Reform and

EXPANDING FEE-BASED PROGRAMS

Rising demand for the Bank's knowledge services led to the
establishment of fee-based programs in Algeria, Egypt, and
Libya and the opening of a Bank office in Kuwait in fiscal 2008.
In the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, where it has long
provided fee-based services, the Bank is aiming to engage
more strategically. Toward that end, the Kuwaiti and Saudi
technical cooperation programs are transitioning to a multisectoral programmatic approach that aims to increase policy
implementation support. Similar approaches are gaining
momentum in Bahrain, Oman, and Qatar and are being
explored in the United Arab Emirates. (See http://www
.worldbank.org/mna.]

 

The Arab World Initiative aims to accelerate the integration of
the Arab world into the global economy to spur growth,
create better jobs, reduce disparities within the region,
increase social inclusion, and better manage natural
resources. Recognizing that countries in the Arab world have
been underserved, the Bank Group has launched consultations with a broad range of stakeholders to identify development priorities. To further this initiative, Bank activities

in the Arab world will focus on support for the following

main goals:

¢ Development of physical and institutional infrastructure
for trade and economic diversification

¢ Private job creation

¢ Efficient, effective, and transparent allocation and
management of public resources for development

¢ Inclusion of women, youth, minorities, and the poor

¢ Higher quality and relevance of education

¢ Better management of natural resources, especially
water

Achievements to date include support for the establishment of the Arab Water Academy and the cosponsoring
of a conference on Strengthening the Pan Arab Free
Trade Area.

REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES 533 SUMMARY OF FISCAL YEAR ACTIVITIESWORLD BANK LENDING

The World Bank mobilizes financing by borrowing from
international capital markets (for IBRD) and by allocating
grants and credits using contributions from richer member
countries (for IDA]. It channels these resources to benefit
poor people in borrowing member countries.

Lending is tailored to individual country needs, using
lending instruments that are becoming increasingly flexible.
Figures 3.1-3.3 and table 3.1 summarize combined IBRD-IDA
lending in fiscal 2008.

LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES

The Role of IDA

IDA is the largest multilateral channel of concessional
financing to the world’s poorest countries. In fiscal 2008,
countries with annual per capita income of up to $1,065 were
eligible for IDA assistance. In addition, IDA supports some
countries, including several small island economies, that
are above the income cutoff but lack the creditworthiness
needed to borrow from IBRD. To date, 23 countries have
graduated from IDA. Some of these, most recently China
and the Arab Republic of Egypt, have now become IDA
donors. The allocation of IDA’s resources is determined
primarily by each recipient's rating in the annual Country
Policy and Institutional Assessments. The chief IDA
concern is Sub-Saharan Africa; therefore, its countries
are recommended for priority in the allocation process.

n the case of countries that are eligible for both IDA and
BRD funds, IDA allocations must also take into account
hose countries’ creditworthiness for and access to other
sources of funds.

IDA supports countries’ efforts to boost economic growth,
reduce poverty, and improve the living conditions of the poor.
n its operational work, it faces a full spectrum of country
conditions, including postconflict reconstruction, economic
ransition, vulnerability, and rapid and sustained growth.
While continuing to support all low-income countries, IDA is
expected to direct half of its financial assistance in the next
hree years to Sub-Saharan Africa, subject to performance.
Significant assistance will also be directed to the poorest
countries in South and East Asia.

IDA commitments in fiscal 2008 reached $11.2 billion (see
igure 3.4). This funding, including $7.8 billion in credits and
3.4 billion in grants, supported 199 operations.

The largest share of IDA resources was committed to Africa,
which received $5.7 billion, or 50 percent of total IDA commitments. South Asia ($2.8 billion) and East Asia and Pacific
$1.8 billion) also received large shares of total funding. Vietnam
and India were the largest single recipients of funding.

The largest commitments went to the public administration sector [including law and justice}, which received
$2.9 billion in financing (26 percent of the total). IDA has
become one of the major sources of financing for infrastructure, including energy and mining; transportation;
water, sanitation, and flood protection; and information
and communications technologies sectors, whose share
in total official development assistance flows has declined
in recent years despite enormous need. Combined, these
sectors received $4.3 billion, 39 percent of the total IDA
commitments. Significant support was also provided to
the education ($1.2 billion) and agriculture ($1 billion}
sectors.

The themes receiving the most funding were public sector
governance ($2.3 billion], financial and private sector development ($1.7 billion), and rural development ($1.6 billion). Major
attention was also paid to human development ($1.7 billion)
and urban development ($1.1 billion}. Figures 3.4-3.7 summarize IDA lending for fiscal 2008, and figure 3.8 looks at IDA
lending in relation to infrastructure.

IDA Resources

IDA is financed largely by contributions from donor governments [figure 3.9). Additional financing includes transfers
from IBRD’s net income, grants from IFC, and borrowers’
repayment of earlier IDA credits.

Every three years, donor governments and representatives
of borrower countries meet to discuss |DA’s policies and
priorities and to agree on the amount of new resources
required to fund its lending program over the following three
years. The major issues discussed during this fiscal year’s
replenishment meetings were climate change, IDA‘s role
in strengthening harmonization and alignment to enhance
country-level effectiveness, and a focus on results by evaluating the IDA14 measurement system and by establishing

introduced in 2006. For the 41 countries currently identified
as HIPCs, the total debt relief to be delivered by IDA under
HIPC and by MDRI is estimated at $18 billion and $37 billion, respectively.

Under the Debt Reduction Facility for IDA-only countries,
two implementation grants [for Mozambique and Nicaragua]
were closed in fiscal year 2008, extinguishing just under
$1.5 billion of commercial external debt in terms at least
as favorable as those provided by other creditors under the
HIPC Initiative. In the case of Mozambique, 100 percent of
the eligible claims were tendered and extinguished. In the
case of Nicaragua, creditors representing 95 percent
of the eligible claims participated in the operation, including
the four creditors that had obtained court judgments against
Nicaragua.

To help countries maintain debt sustainability, IDA has
developed a system—already adopted by some other multilateral development banks—for allocating grants based on
countries’ risk of debt distress as assessed under the Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries. The
approach helps mitigate the risk of debt distress in the
future. IDA is also working with the IMF to support debt
management in IDA-only countries through the provision of
technical assistance in designing medium-term debt management strategies. This work has been complemented by
IDA’s Debt Management Performance Assessment tool, a
methodology for identifying strengths and weaknesses in
debt management operations through a comprehensive set
of indicators.Regional and Global Efforts

IDA’s strengths at the country level enable it to address regional
and global issues. Issues such as prevention and control of
HIV/AIDS, environmental preservation, regional and global
trade integration, and global financial stability ultimately need
to be tackled at the country level. By leveraging its countryfocused assistance and policy dialogue, IDA helps to integrate
regional and global priorities into country strategies. At the
same time, through its involvement in global policy making,
coupled with its intensive activities in the field, IDA supports the
alignment of national, regional, and global priorities.

IDA has the strengths to help raise the effectiveness of
official development assistance and tackle the new challenges
created by the shifting aid architecture. To achieve these
objectives, IDA must focus on improvement in four main areas:
strengthening complementarity with vertical approaches to aid
delivery; ensuring appropriate sectoral funding; addressing
critical global challenges, particularly climate change; and
enhancing alignment and harmonization. IDA is working to
reform and update its operational policies to improve effectiveness and therefore its ability to meet these challenges.

Fragile and Conflict-Affected Countries

Following the approval in February 2007 of a new policy
framework on rapid response and on strengthening the
Bank's engagement in fragile and conflict-affected countries,
the Fragile and Conflict-Affected Countries Group was
created in July 2007, subsuming the conflict and fragility
agendas. During fiscal 2008, the Bank deepened its cooperation with international partners in addressing the needs of
countries facing such challenges. At the Annual Meetings in
October 2007, the Heads of Multilateral Development Banks
agreed on a more harmonized approach to their engagement
in fragile situations. During the year, the United Nations
Development Group and the Bank consolidated their work on
joint postconflict needs assessments and finalized a joint
guidance note on integrated recovery planning. The Bank also
engaged actively in deliberations of the United Nations Peace

ECONOMIC RESEARCH FORUM

Building Commission. Consultations with the UN ona
partnership framework were also initiated.

As part of the IDA15 replenishment process, the period of
exceptional allocation was extended from seven to ten years
for postconflict countries and from three to five years for
reengaging countries. Furthermore, a systematic approach to
arrears clearance was approved that will facilitate the process
of normalization with the Bank for conflict-affected countries
with arrears.

Between July 2007 and June 2008, Bank commitments
to fragile and postconflict countries exceeded $2.2 billion.
During the same period, the Post Conflict Fund and Low
Income Countries Under Stress Trust Fund financed 25 projects worth $29.8 million. These two funds were merged into a
new, multiyear State- and Peace-Building Fund, approved in
April 2008. The fund's first-year budget of $33 million was
approved in June 2008.

The Bank is implementing a strategy to increase field
presence, strengthen the ability in sectors to document
lessons learned and deploy experienced staff between
regions and country programs, establish specialized institutional backup teams for emergency projects, and enhance
incentives for staff working in and on fragile and conflictaffected countries. Finally, the Board approved the Bank's
new compensation policy, which supports decentralization
and facilitates the placement of staff in fragile states
through an enhanced compensation package. Work on
a complementary package of nonfinancial incentives is
under way.

MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES

Middle-income countries face substantial development
challenges. They must sustain growth that provides productive
employment while reducing poverty and inequality. They

must manage macroeconomic risks stemming from volatile
capital flows, contingent liabilities, financial markets, and
pensions. They must build crisis-management capability

to deal with global threats. They must enhance their

 

As part of an initiative to strengthen the Bank’s engagement with the
Arab world and enhance the Bank’s knowledge and learning agenda, the
Development Economics Vice Presidency and regional partners launched
a new initiative in fiscal 2008. Partly funded through a Development
Grant Facility grant, the Research Initiative for Arab Development will be
implemented by the Economic Research Forum, a regional network of
researchers based in Cairo.

The expected outcomes are a broader and higher-quality knowledge base
that is relevant for high-priority themes, such as increasing economic

growth and diversification in the presence of large oil rents; achieving
stronger and more vibrant regional integration; understanding and
responding to the challenges of increased inequality; and dealing with
water scarcity, climate change, and other severe environmental
problems. An important component of the initiative is the dissemination
of this knowledge in order to build consensus and encourage better
policy making in the region. Through the initiative, a broader cadre of
researchers from the region will become actively involved in policy
debates, strengthening the platform for better decision making.

SUMMARY OF FISCAL YEAR ACTIVITIES 59competitiveness, adopt clean energy, ensure environmental
sustainability, and strengthen the institutional and governance
structures that underpin viable market-based economies. The
Bank is uniquely placed to help middle-income countries deal
with all of these challenges through IBRD.

The Role of IBRD

IBRD is a triple-A-rated financial institution with some
unusual characteristics. Its shareholders and clients are
sovereign governments, each of which has a voice in setting
IBRD’s policies. As a global development cooperative,
IBRD’s purpose is to help members achieve equitable and
sustainable growth in their economies and find solutions

to regional and global problems in economic development
and environmental sustainability, all with a view to reducing
poverty and improving standards of living. IBRD pursues
these goals by providing financing, risk management
products, and other financial services; specialized expertise;
and strategic and convening services as requested by its
members.

IBRD Financial Services

New lending commitments by IBRD rose in fiscal 2008 to
$13.5 billion for 99 operations. Development-policy lending
represented 29 percent of total IBRD lending, up slightly from
28 percent in fiscal 2007.

Latin America and the Caribbean received the largest
share of IBRD lending, with $4.4 billion (32 percent of total
IBRD commitments). It was followed by Europe and Central
Asia, which received $3.7 billion (28 percent) in funding, and
East Asia and Pacific, which received $2.7 billion (20 percent).
Lending was less concentrated in fiscal 2008. Whereas the
largest five countries received 56 percent of total lending in
fiscal 2007, five countries—Azerbaijan, Brazil, China, India,
and Turkey—received combined commitments of 53 percent
of total IBRD lending in fiscal 2008.

The transportation sector received the largest share of IBRD
lending ($3 billion), followed by the energy and mining sector
($2.8 billion) and the public administration, including law
and justice, sector ($2.4 billion]. The thematic composition of
lending was led by financial and private sector development
($4.5 billion), followed by public sector governance ($2.1
billion), urban development ($1.9 billion), and environmental
and natural resource management ($1.9 billion).

Figures 3.10-3.12 show IBRD lending by region, theme,
and sector. Development policy-based lending commitments
are shown on the accompanying CD-ROM.

IBRD offers risk management products for clients to
manage risks related to currency, interest rate, commodity
price, and natural disasters. In fiscal 2008, it executed

IBRD Resources

IBRD obtains most of its funds by selling bonds in international capital markets. In fiscal 2008, it raised $19 billion at
medium- to long-term maturities. Debt securities, with a
wide range of maturities and structures, were issued in

19 currencies.

IBRD is able to borrow high volumes on very favorable
terms. IBRD’s strength is based on its prudent financial
policies and practices, which help maintain its high credit
rating. As a cooperative institution, IBRD seeks not to
maximize profit but to earn enough income to ensure
its financial strength and to sustain its development
activities. IBRD’s operating income was $2,271 million
in fiscal 2008.

IBRD retained $811 million in its general reserve,
$117 million in its pension reserve, and $10 million in
its externally financed outputs adjustment account, and
it added $750 million to the surplus account. In August
2007, the Executive Directors proposed that the Board of
Governors approve a transfer of $583 million to IDA from
allocable net income in fiscal 2008 {see “Financial
Statements” on the CD-ROM).

IBRD maintained adequate liquidity in fiscal 2008 to
ensure its ability to meet its obligations. As of June 30,
2008, it held about $23 billion in liquid assets. Also as
of June 30, 2008, IBRD’s outstanding borrowings from
capital markets were about $80.7 billion (net of swaps)
(figure 3.13]. Total disbursed and outstanding loans were
$99 billion.

Consistent with IBRD’s development mandate, the principal risk it takes is the country credit risk inherent in its
portfolio of loans and guarantees. Risks related to interest
and exchange rates are minimized. One summary measure
of the Bank's risk profile is the ratio of equity to outstanding
net loans, which is closely managed in line with the Bank’s
financial and risk outlook. This ratio stood at 37.6 percent as
of June 30, 2008 [figure 3.14).

NONLENDING ACTIVITIES

Country Assistance Strategies

A country assistance strategy (CAS) guides Bank Group
activities within a borrowing member country. Starting with a
country’s vision of its development goals, a CAS is prepared in
close cooperation with the government and in consultation

with civil society organizations, development partners, and
other stakeholders. It assesses the country’s development
challenges and priorities and lays out a program of lending
and nonlending activities to support the country's development efforts. During fiscal 2008, the Bank prepared 49 CAS
products, including 18 CAS progress reports and nine interim
strategy notes, which are prepared when a country assistance
strategy cannot be prepared because of specific country
circumstances. Of these, 12 were prepared jointly with IFC,
and several were prepared collaboratively with other donors.

Strategy Development

In September 2007, the “Sector Strategy Implementation
Update” (SSIU} was presented to the Executive Directors’
Committee on Development Effectiveness. The SSIU provides

SUMMARY OF FISCAL YEAR ACTIVITIES 61an overview of the Bank’s strategic focus and the delivery of
the work program across all 17 sectors and thematic areas in
which the Bank is engaged. In addition, the fiscal 2008 SSIU
reported on the strategies for four sectors: environment,
forestry, social protection, and transport.

A concept and issues note, “Towards a Strategic Framework
on Climate Change and Development for the World Bank
Group,” was presented to the Development Committee in
February 2008. The document included a progress report on
the Clean Energy Investment Framework. The Bank also
published a draft “Sustainable Infrastructure Action Plan,
FY09-10,” which was presented to the Development
Committee in April 2008. In addition, the Governance and
Anticorruption Implementation Plan went to the Board in
September 2007, and a first-year progress report on the
Gender Action Plan was discussed in March 2008. Finally,
an approach paper to revamp sector and results reporting was
submitted to the Development Committee in June 2008 and
discussed in July 2008.

Economic and Sector Work and

Nonlending Technical Assistance

Economic and sector work (ESW] and nonlending technical
assistance (TA} are the Bank’s two largest nonlending product
lines. The Bank delivered 489 ESW and 513 TA activities in
fiscal 2008. TA deliveries have been increasing, surpassing
the total number of ESW activities this year. More than half of
total TA activities focused on providing operational guidance
on formulating and implementing policies and programs.
Law and justice and public administration, and finance were
the two leading sectors for both ESW and TA activities.

The Bank continues to coordinate ESW with development
partners and clients as committed in the Paris Declaration.
Preparation of about half of all ESW delivered in fiscal 2008

was coordinated, compared with approximately 40 percent
in fiscal 2007.

Research

The Bank's research group aims to provide practitioners with
original knowledge to inform policy discussions and ultimately
to help solve development problems. Bank research is a key
source of information and understanding on development
issues for outside researchers and the policy community.

In fiscal 2008, the research group conducted in-depth
research on over 70 developing countries as well as crosscountry comparative work. The group published 25 new
books, 175 journal articles, and 90 book chapters. The topics
included China and India in the global economy; volatility and
growth; terrorism, political openness, and development;
postconflict transitions; donor fragmentation; access to
finance; finance in Africa; microenterprises; various aspects
of trade; migration and women; child health; land reform;
inequality of opportunity; the urbanization of poverty; and the
impacts of climate change.

Evaluative research has become a theme of the group's
work. During the year, the group's impact evaluations advanced
across a range of sectors, including groundbreaking work to
measure the effectiveness and reach of conditional cash transfer
programs and other social service delivery mechanisms.

The group puts great weight on its data and software
products. New and updated data sets were further improved
in fiscal 2008 to help users monitor poverty, assess trade
and financial regulations, and measure governance. (See
http://www.econ.worldbank.org/research.]

World Bank Institute

The World Bank Institute (WBI] is one of the World Bank's
capacity development instruments. It identifies countries’
capacity needs and develops learning activities to address

 

According to the Bank’s Quality Assurance Group, drawing on data from the
Independent Evaluation Group, 76 percent of projects completed in fiscal
2007 had satisfactory development outcomes, compared with 83 percent

in fiscal 2006, 81 percent in fiscal 2005, and 77 percent in fiscal 2004.
Declines in outcomes were evident in the Africa region, as well as in health,
nutrition, and population; public sector governance; and finance and
private sector development. Fragile states continue to pose challenges,
with only 62 percent of completed operations between fiscal years 2004 and
2007 producing satisfactory development outcomes. The fiscal 2008 Annual
Report on Portfolio Performance (ARPP] will be available in early 2009.

The fiscal 2007 ARPP notes the apparent inconsistency between the
somewhat better aggregate performance of lending and the much

62 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2008

weaker performance of country programs, which were rated about

60 percent satisfactory based on the country assistance evaluations
conducted during the past 10 years. It also finds outcomes at the sector
level to be lower than project outcomes, especially in rural development,
public sector governance, and private sector development. Weaknesses in
program design were the main factors leading to lower sector outcomes.

While the overall quality of analytic and advisory activities was satisfactory, the likely impact was considered weak, mainly because of
inadequate dialogue and dissemination of results to country partners.
Given that the share of analytic and advisory activities in country services
expenditures now surpasses that of lending, improving their efficiency
and impact requires greater management attention.them. Courses and retreats cover numerous topics, from the
environment to financial sector regulation, from publicprivate partnerships in infrastructure to water resources
management and rural development. In fiscal 2008, WBI
delivered some 570 learning activities and reached more than
39,500 participants, 34 percent of whom were women and

27 percent of whom were from Africa.

Among the most prominent of WBI's global programs are
those in governance, anticorruption, and knowledge for
development (K4D]. The K4D program assesses the preparedness of a country or region to compete in the global knowledge economy on the basis of WBI’s Knowledge Assessment
Methodology (KAM). The 2008 KAM identifies specific areas
where policy makers may need to focus more attention
to increase their countries’ competitiveness. (See http://
go.worldbank.org/AW9KZWJB10.) In fiscal 2008, the K4D
program published a comprehensive global report on Building
Knowledge Economies: Advanced Strategies for Development,
and a report on Enhancing China's Competitiveness through
Lifelong Learning.

With the Development Economics group, WBI launched the
seventh release of the Worldwide Governance Indicators,
representing a decade-long effort by researchers to build the
most comprehensive cross-country set of governance indicators currently available to the public. Covering 212 countries
and territories, the indicators are widely used by policy makers
and researchers. (See http://www.govindicators.org.)

WEBI also provides an environment for knowledge innovation
on frontier issues in development. One such topic is Diaspora
Networks—highly skilled people who have emigrated from
developing countries. The members of such networks can
provide a bridge between developing countries and global
state-of-the-art solutions in policy, technological, and
managerial expertise by sharing knowledge and leading
investment initiatives in their countries of origin. WBI is piloting
a number of operational mechanisms for leveraging a country's
expatriate talent abroad by identifying and nurturing these
networks of highly successful professionals. Some have already
shown results in the area of innovation systems, for example, in
Argentina, Armenia, Chile, Mexico, and South Africa.

In addition, WBI published a unique interactive trade
database: the “World Trade Indicators.” This tool benchmarks
a country’s historical and current trade performance through
2007 along multiple policy, institutional, and outcome dimensions. (See http://www.worldbank.org/wti2008 )

Project-Based and Client Training

IEG evaluated client training activities in Using Training to
Build Capacity for Development: An Evaluation of the World
Bank's Project-Based and WBI Training—the Bank's primary
instrument for capacity building. Bank-financed client training

resulted in individual learning gains but had less impact in
affecting workplace behavior or strengthening institutional
capacity. One key lesson here is that organizational and
institutional context must be conducive to individual learning if
development capacity is to be achieved. The evaluation also
highlighted the importance of well-designed and -targeted
training content and strong country commitment.

GLOBAL CONNECTIONS
Global and regional partnerships are increasing because of
the growing integration of the world’s economies and the
existence of development challenges that cut across national
boundaries. These partnerships promote collaboration in
areas of common concern such as combating communicable
diseases, preserving the environment, fostering agricultural
research, acquiring and sharing knowledge, integrating trade,
addressing international migration issues, and developing
infrastructure. The Bank is also continuing its work with
development partners on cooperative measures that minimize
the cost of delivering aid and thereby increase aid effectiveness. The Bank currently participates in some 194 global and
regional partnerships; nearly $187 million from the Bank's
own resources has been disbursed in fiscal 2008 to support
global and regional partnerships as of the end of fiscal 2008.
The Bank plays different roles in these initiatives, including
as a trustee of donor funds, a financial contributor, and an
implementing agency.

Global Development Learning Network

Launched in 2000, the Global Development Learning Network
(GDLN] is a partnership of more than 120 learning centers
(known as Affiliates) in 80 countries. GDLN Affiliates collaborate in designing customized learning solutions for people
working in development around the world. Offering formal
training courses, multicountry dialogues, and virtual
conferences that blend face-to-face and distance-learning
approaches, GDLN Affiliates enable individuals, teams, and
organizations anywhere in the world to communicate, share
specialized knowledge, and learn from each others’ experiences ina timely and cost-effective manner.

The GDLN hosted more than 1,000 learning events in fiscal
2008, reaching some 100,000 people worldwide in government agencies, private sector entities, academia, and
nongovernmental organizations. (See http://www.gdln.org.}

Trust Funds

Trust funds administered by the Bank Group have emerged as
key vehicles for channeling official development assistance.
As of the end of fiscal 2008, the Bank Group held a total of
$26.3 billion in trust ($16.9 billion in cash and $9.4 billion in
promissory notes], which it administered through 1,021 active

funds. These trust funds accepted $8.8 billion in cash contributions from donors (table 3.2) and disbursed $6.7 billion to
recipients in fiscal 2008. At the end of the fiscal year, annual
trust fund disbursements accounted for 26 percent of total
disbursements from IDA, IBRD, and trust funds, up from just
12 percent at the end of fiscal 2003.

Trust funds support a variety of development objectives
at the country, regional, and global levels, ranging from more
traditional country-based investments to vertical approaches
that target specific global priorities or support thematic areas
of interest to the international development community. For
country-based investments, which are executed by the
recipient, a large part of disbursements during fiscal 2008
supported public administration and law, health and social
services, and education. For global programs, most disbursements were made through vertical funds such as the Global

64 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2008

Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; the Global
Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization; the Global
Environment Facility; and Carbon Finance.

In recognition of the rapidly growing trust funds portfolio
and the need to strengthen its management, the Bank's
Board of Executive Directors approved a Trust Fund
Management Framework in October 2007. This framework
aims to promote a more strategic approach to ensure
relevance and rigor in the selection of different types of
trust funds, consistent with the Bank's business needs; to
strengthen risk management and controls; and to enhance
operational efficiency and sustainability, including through a
new trust fund fee structure. Reforms and policies implemented by the framework are being mainstreamed into the
Bank's operational policies and procedures.

Cofinancing

Cofinancing is any arrangement under which funds from the
Bank are associated with funds provided by sources outside
the recipient country for a specific lending operation. In fiscal
2008, 84 Bank projects leveraged $4.29 billion in cofinancing.
Major cofinanciers were the Japan Bank for International
Cooperation ($690 million) and the UK Department for International Development ($590 million]. The three regions that
benefited the most were East Asia and Pacific ($940 million),
Middle East and North Africa ($880 million), and Africa

($870 million}. Education, transport, and energy and mining
sector projects received $930 million, $780 million, and
$770 million, respectively. Bilateral agencies contributed
$1.95 billion in cofinancing.

Enhancing World Bank-IMF Collaboration

By drawing on complimentary expertise and institutional
comparative advantage, collaboration between the World
Bank and IMF improves Bank effectiveness and helps
eliminate overlap. The Board strongly supported implementation of the Joint Management Action Plan (JMAP] for
enhancing collaboration, prepared in response to recommendations of the External Review Committee on IMF-Bank
collaboration (The Malan Report). Board members highlighted the value of encouraging greater mobility between
the Bank and the IMF. They called for ongoing support from
senior management for JMAP implementation and diligent
monitoring of progress.OPERATIONAL SUMMARY | FISCAL 2008

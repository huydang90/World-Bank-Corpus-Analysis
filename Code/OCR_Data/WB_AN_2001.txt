Fiscal 2001 was the first
time in 10 years that IDA
lending to Africa reached 50
percent of total IDA lending, a target set by IDA
donors

Intense efforts to sustain
gains in project quality continued into fiscal 2001. At
year-end, only 12 percent of
Bank-financed projects
under implementation were
at risk of not achieving their
development objectives,
compared with 29 percent

Fiscal 2001 Highlights

Sixteen countries qualified
for debt relief under the
enhanced Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative in fiscal 2001,
more than double the number in fiscal 2000. As of
June 30, 2001, a total of 23
countries were receiving
debt relief totaling $34 billion in nominal terms, from
all creditors

With country and global

S q . ,Message from the President of the World Bank and
Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors

The poverty reduction agenda has advanced sigmificantly over the past year, with development partners
coming together as never before. We must now build
on that momentum. Progress in reducing poverty
remains slow too many girls still do not go to
school, too many children die before the age of five,
and too many poor people lack opportunity.

The urgency for action 1s pressing. Nearly half
of the world’s people live on less than $2 a day, and
their numbers will grow in the next 25 years, as
nearly two bilhon more people are added to developing countries’ populations. The stakes are high, as
poverty touches all—and drives prospects for no less
than global peace How can we scale up successes
enough to meet the international development goals
for 2015? (See page 4 ) Only with concerted action
can we make a difference.

PROGRESS IS EVIDENT...AT THE COUNTRY AND
REGIONAL LEVELS...

Over the past year, | was privileged to visit India
and Africa, which, between them, hold 55 percent
of the world’s poor. They offer striking examples of
the ways in which societies are transforming.

In India’s Andhra Pradesh state, rural women
are engaging in open discussions—unthinkable a
few years ago—on how to confront the problem of
HIV/AIDS. In the same state, e-government has
cut the time taken for land registration from six
months to 20 minutes. Elsewhere, empowered
grassroots communities are successfully implementing the country’s education projects now covering
50 million children.

Africa 1s on the move. On a first-ever joint
trip by the heads of the World Bank and the IMF,
Horst Kohler and I met with 22 African presidents.
We were deeply impressed by their conviction that
Africa’s future lies in its own hands, and by their
commitment to far-reaching change Leaders
stressed the need to deal with conflict and governance, combat HIV/AIDS; and pursue stronger
regional cooperation.

Middle-income countries, too, are addressing
poverty-related concerns ranging from inequality and
governance to urban pollution and rural infrastructure, and are increasingly adopting sound macroeco

nomic policies Developing countries, on average,
have begun to enjoy higher per capita growth rates
than industrial countries

«AND AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL...

A remarkable development of the past year 1s the
unprecedented alignment of partners around a common global development agenda, embodied in the
Millennium Declaration adopted by leaders of the
world’s nations Common guiding principles for
development partnership, too, as outlined in the
Comprehensive Development Framework, have
gained growing acceptance—by the United Nations
and, most recently, by the Development Committee
for application also in middle-income countries
These principles emphasize a comprehensive
approach, country ownership, partnership, and a
focus on results Other major steps forward are the
European Union’s decision to adopt the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Papers approach, as well as
growing efforts among all donors to harmonize aid
procedures and untie procurement«BUT 2015 IS APPROACHING, AND ALL MUST ACT

Halving the percentage of those in poverty by 2015
1s an immense challenge Global action 1s a moral
imperative. all have a responsibility.

Developing countries need to ensure sound policy
and institutional environments and an attractive investment chmate. Equally crucial are inclusive policies, to
allow the benefits of growth to reach poor people

Donor countries need to remove trade barriers
and open their markets. They need to provide debt
relief and new concessional finance, multilaterally—
foremost through an adequate 13th Replenishment
of IDA and funding of the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countnies (HIPC) Initiative—as well as bilaterally.
An increase in aid 1s crucial, from the present 0 22
percent of gross national income to the 0 7 percent
share commutted by rich countries. And concerted
international efforts must help fight major global
problems and strengthen the structures needed to
help countries avoid crises and integrate into the
global economy.

Action and progess, moreover, will need to be
built on a solid base of global growth and sound
macroeconomic policies

THE WORLD BANK IS COMMITTED TO
CONCERTED ACTION

Guided by the 2015 poverty goal, we have strengthened the poverty focus of our efforts. This has
meant intensified support to the HIPC Initiative,
helping 23 of the world’s poorest countries shift
about $1 bilhon from annual debt service to spending on basic social services It has also meant helping the governments of poor countries take the lead
In preparing poverty reduction strategies developed
with national consensus, and especially involving
civil society and the private sector. The role of business in job creation 1s crucial, we have expanded our
work in microcredit and our support for small and
medium enterprises

We have radically transformed the way we do
business. A persistent focus on quality has vastly
improved the effectiveness of billions of dollars of
Bank lending We are also responding more quickly
and flexibly to chent needs and have substantially
strengthened our knowledge sharing with clients.

We have made partnership—with countries
and with other development agencies—intrinsic to
all that we do A key priority is the ongoing imitative
for the harmonization of donor policies and procedures to reduce costs for developing countries

And we have stepped up collaborative efforts
to address such enormous development challenges
as HIV/AIDS, conflict, environmental decline, and
the digital divide These efforts have included innovative support to help Afnica fight HIV/AIDS and
become more competitive

In fiscal 2001 the Bank articulated a Strategic
Framework for action over the next three years
The Framework sets two priorities strengthening
countries’ investment climates, and helping them
empower and invest in poor people. It emphasizes
selectivity—within and across countries as well as
at the global level—and partnership

What counts, ultimately, is impact. Outcomes
of individual Bank-financed operations have
improved markedly. But achieving the broader
impact of an overall Country Assistance Strategy is
a long-term endeavor, involving players and factors
beyond the control of any one institution. The coming together of the development community on a
common set of development goals provides a solid
basis for progress. The Bank 1s committed to action
to help realize this vision. I am deeply indebted to
my colleagues whose commitment has earned us
our position of strength today. I rely on them to take
the Bank forward, in concert with our partners.

In closing, on behalf of the Board of Directors
and Bank staff, I would like to pay tribute to the late
Ibrahim Shihata who died on May 28, 2001. As
Senior Vice President and General Counsel from
1983 to 1998, Ibrahim was a bnilant lawyer and dedicated officer of this institution (see page 61). History
will recognize his landmark contnbutions to the Bank
Group and to the cause of poverty reduction in our
client countnies.

More information on the international development goals, including regional and country-level data, is available on a new

Development indicators, published annually by the World Bank, includes a report on progress toward the goals, and many
supporting indicatorsIncidence of income poverty down 20 percent, but uneven progress

The global decline has been driven by progress in China and India. With higher
growth in developing countries, the goal can be achieved globally, but at current rates
of progress many countries will fall short.

Enrollment rates rising slowly

Primary school enrollments remain far off track, especially in South Asia and
Sub-Saharan Africa. Even countries that have succeeded in bringing more children
to school need to worry about the quality of education.

Progress in some regions, but little time left

Eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary education is one step
toward gender equality and the empowerment of women. Very little time is left

before 2005, the target year.

 

Slow progress on average

Many countries have significantly cut these rates In the last 10 years, but on
current trends no region will achieve these goals.

Improved health care needed

While data are not sufficient to measure maternal mortality trends, global estimates
suggest that over 500,000 women died from causes related to childbirth in 1995.
If skilled health personnel attended 90 percent of all births, those numbers could be

dramatically reduced.

 

 

 

 

 

Rising contraceptive use in most countries

But there are large regional differences. in Sub-Saharan Africa, only 26 percent
of married women practice contraception. In East Asia, over 75 percent do.

 

Access to water improving

Achieving the 2015 target in Africa, Asia, and Latin America will require providing
an additional 1.5 billion peopte with access to an improved water source.

 

 

 

The international development goals set targets for reduction in poverty, Improvements
in health and education, and protection of
the environment. First agreed on at major
United Nations (U.N.) conferences in the
1990s, the goals have been adopted by the
Wortd Bank, the International Monetary
Fund, the members of the Development
Assistance Committee of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and
Development, and many other agencies, as
a framework for motivating (and measuring)
development progress. Marking an ‘extraordinary consensus reflected In the U.N.
Millennium Declaration, an expanded set of
goals was endorsed by 149 heads of state
and adopted by the U.N. General Assembly
in September 2000.

The ambitious targets for 2015 provide
a formidable challenge to the international
community. One-fifth of alt people tive on
less than $1 a day. About 10 million children
under the age of five died in 1999, most
from preventable diseases. Over 500,000
women die each year during pregnancy or
childbirth, And about 113 million children
do not attend primary school. Achieving the
goals means lifting more than 300 million
out of poverty, preventing more than 55 million infant and child deaths and over 4 miltion maternal deaths, and providing places
for at least 128 million more primary school
students by 2015. After 10 years, there are
signs of progress, but many of the goals are
not likely to be achieved without renewed —
and bold—effort.Meeting the Poverty Challenge: Progress toward the Goals
..and uneven progress across regions...

PROGRESS TO DATE

Substantial progress in poverty reduction has been
made in some areas. In the 1990s significant
progress was made in reducing income poverty in
East Asia before the 1997 financial crisis, and the
negative impact of the crisis was partially reversed
during the subsequent recovery. The share of people
living below $1 per day also declined in Latin
America and the Caribbean, and in South Asia,
although the number of poor people still increased
in South Asia because of population growth. On
average, poverty declined in fast-growing countries
and increased in countries experiencing stagnation
or contraction.

PROSPECTS FOR 2015

Projections indicate that, if developing countries’
average per capita gross domestic product (GDP)
were to grow at a sustained rate of 3.7 percent
(“base case” in the graphs)—-higher than the 1990s"
average of 1.8 percent and the 2.3 percent average
of the low case used for the graphs—the global incidence of absolute poverty could decline from 23
percent in 1998 to 13 percent in 2015. The number
of poor could drop from 1.2 billion to less than 800
million. But many countries, especially in Africa,
would still not reach the goal of halving poverty by
2015.

The International Development Goals:
A Particular Challenge for Africa

Life expectancy decreased, on average,
from 50 years in 1987 to 47 years in 1999,
largely under the devastating impact of
HIV/AIDS; in hardest-hit countries such as
Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa, and
Zimbabwe, life expectancy fell by more than
10 years,

Child mortality increased from 155 per
1,000 in 1990 to 161 per 1,000 in 1999; it
declined in ail other regions.

Health-care systems, weakened by conflict,
poor management, and the impact of
HIV/AIDS, are finding themselves unable to
cope with traditional illnesses, and malaria
and tuberculosis continue to kill mitlions
Gross primary school enrollment rates
declined between 1980 and the mid-1990s;
nine countries still reported net primary
enrollment rates of less than 50 percent in
the 1990s, with even lower rates for girls.

But breaking the cycle of impoverishment Is

Meeting the Poverty Challenge: An Agenda for Action
..demand that all partners accept responsibility...

The international development goals reflect an
unprecedented consensus of the international community. Shared goals support the effort to increase
aid effectiveness through stronger partnership and
country leadership

A NEW DEVELOPMENT COMPACT

The agenda facing developing countries is formidable. Many developing countries already reflect the
goals in their strategies, others have identified specific intermediate measures linked to longer-term
poverty reduction outcomes. Pursuing sound domestic policies will be critical to attracting greater
resources. Sound macroeconomic policies, strong
financial systems, and well-functioning regulatory,
legal, and judicial frameworks will enhance the
effectiveness of aid and attract more productive
private investment.

The responsibility of developed countries stands
out even more clearly as developing countries take
full responsibility for their own choices. Key areas
for action are summarized below.

1 Dismantling trade barriers is fundamental
Trade barriers in high-income countries cost
developing countries over $100 billion a year
Trade restrictions set by the high-income members
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) offset the benefit of
their aid contributions (See left figure below.)

Trends in Social Spending before and
after Assistance under the Heavily

2 The debt relief agenda must go forward
Following the substantial advances made in fiscal
2001, the next challenge is to move forward with
implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries Initiative, in particular in those countries affected by conflict. Securing sustainable
financing on appropriately concessional terms will
also be important. (See middle figure below )

3 Now is the time to increase aid
Developing countnies’ efforts to improve their policy environments are allowing them to make more
effective use of aid. Support from most members
of the OECD Development Assistance
Committee (DAC) falls well short of the pledged
07 percent share of gross national income, so far
only Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway,
Sweden—and most recently Luxembourg—have
met this target While average DAC contributions
declined in 2000, however, aid levels from 15 of
22 DAC members increased over the prior year.
(See nght figure below.)

4 Simplifying and harmonizing aid procedures will
lower the burden on developing countries
Multilateral and bilateral donors, working
together, can do much to reduce the costs to
developing countries of managing aid programs in
areas ranging from strategy and medium-term
financing to procurement and evaluation Recent
progress in untying aid and procurement will promote efficiency.

What Is IBRD?
IBRD is a AAA-rated financial institution—with some unusual characteristics. its shareholders are sovereign governments. Its member

borrowers have a voice in setting its policies. They also usually accord
preferred creditor status to BRD, helping it stay financially strong.
IBRD loans are typically accompanied by nonlending services to ensure
more effective use of funds. Also, unlike commercial banks, it is driven

by a development impact, rather than profit maximization, objective.

Who Are IBRD’s Clients?

Seventy-five percent of people wha live on less than $1 per day live
in countries that receive IBRD lending, which are typically middleincome and enjoy some access to private capital markets but include
countries that also borrow from IDA. Even excluding countries that
also borrow from IDA, such as India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan,
a full 25 percent of the world’s $1-a-day poor live in countries that
are IBRD borrowers,

..and on IDA as an agent for progress in the poorest countries

IDA helps the world’s poorest countries reduce
poverty by providing “credits,” which are loans at
zero interest with a 10-year grace period and maturities of 35 to 40 years These countries face complex
challenges in striving for progress toward the international development goals They must, for example,
respond to the competitive pressures as well as
opportunities of globalization, arrest the spread of
HIV/AIDS, and prevent conflict or deal with its
aftermath To help these countries improve their
prospects, the policy framework emphasizes
Accelerating broad-based growth through sound
macroeconomic and sectoral policies, especially
for rural and private sector development.

' 1 Investing in people through strong support for
the social sectors (see figure), including gender
mainstreaming and efforts to counter the challenge and social impact of communicable diseases, especially HIV/AIDS.

** Building capacity for improving governance—

including in public expenditure management—

and combating corruption.

IDA’S EVOLVING ROLE: GREATER EMPHASIS ON
PARTICIPATION AND PARTNERSHIPS

Responding to recent changes 1n the international
development environment, IDA works more closely
with borrowers and other development partners The
Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, prepared in a
participatory manner by IDA countnies, offer an
opportunity to align donor strategies more closely
with country strategies.

The Bank took important steps in the spring of
2001 to increase transparency and broaden participation in the formulation of DA's operational
approaches Documents for the donor meetings on
the 13th Replenishment of IDA (IDA-13)—which
will fund lending in fiscal 2003-05—are publicly
available at www.worldbank.org/ida (And in
June 2001, for the first time in IDA’s 41-year history,
representatives of borrowing countries joined donors

Contributions to IDA enable the
World Bank to provide $6-7 billion per year in interest-free credits to the world’s 78 poorest
countries, home to 2.4 billion people. This support is vital because
these countries have little or no
capacity to borrow on market
terms. In most of these countries
incomes average under just $500 a
year per person, and many people
survive on much less. IDA helps
provide access to better basic services (such as education, health

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT

In fiscal 2001 IBRD raised $17 billion, before
swaps, at medium- to long-term maturities, in international debt capital markets. Borrowings and
shareholder equity fund IBRD’s loans and investments.

The year’s funding volume was above that of fiscal 2000, after peaking in fiscal 1998 due to
above-average demand for financing.

IBRD’s financial strength is based on the support
it receives from its shareholders and on its array
of financial policies and practices.

IBRD issued debt in nine currencies and in a
wide range of maturities and structures in fiscal
2001. Diversification helps lower borrowers’
funding costs and expands IBRD’s investor base.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION

IDA donors come together every three years to
decide on the amount of new resources required
to fund IDA’s future lending program and to discuss lending policies and priorities.

Fiscal 2001 was the second year of the 12th
Replenishment of IDA. IDA-12 is designed to provide IDA with resources to fund credits committed
during the period July 1, 1999, to June 30, 2002.
Nearly 40 countries are IDA donors. Donor nations
include not only industrial countries but also developing and transition countries—some of them IBRD
borrowers and former IDA borrowers—such as
Argentina, Brazil, Hungary, the Republic of Korea,
the Russian Federation, and Turkey (see page 35).
IDAs financial strength is based on the strong and
continued support of its donors as well as reflows.

Where Do IBRD's Profits Go?

IBRD's net income serves several purposes related to Its mission:
A portion of net Income Is retained annually to ensure IBRD’s
financial Integrity. The General Reserve allows IBRD to assume
credit risk in lending to countries at the lowest funding costs—
which in turn benefits borrowers. Income retention has enabled
{BRO to maintain financial soundness through periods of deteriorating toan quality as well as surging loan demand.
Support to IDA has consistently been a priority. Over the last five
years, $1.6 billion (or about 22 percent of IBRD net income) has
been transferred to IDA.
Support for the Heavily indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative
has also been Important. Over the last five years transfers to the
HIPC Trust Fund have amounted to a total of $900 million, averaging about 12 percent of annual IBRD net Income.
IBRD’s net Income helps meet other developmental needs from
time to time. it enables IBRD to respond to unforeseen humanitarlan crisés and provide grants or other support for worthy
causes. IBRD also regularly shares Income with its borrowing
members through partial waivers of the interest and commitment
fees it contractually charges on its loans.
Financlal strength and standing In the markets allow IBRD to
leverage its equity by five times in the international bond
markets. This leverage increases IBRD’s ability to tend for
developmental activities.

IBRD Operational Results

LENDING: QUALITY UP, VOLUME STABLE

The quality of IBRD operations continued to
improve fewer ongoing projects were at nsk of
not achieving their development objectives compared with last year.

The portfolio of ongoing projects (713) was
smaller than last year's (764), reflecting a
decline in approvals of new operations (91
approved in fiscal 2001 compared with an
annual average of 130 in the last five years) and
efforts to ensure the timely completion of proyects under implementation,

As access to international capital markets continued to improve for many countries, IBRD lending stabilized at slightly below last year’s $10 9
billion.

The share of adjustment lending continued to
decline (38 percent in fiscal 200], down from 41
percent in fiscal 2000 and 63 percent in fiscal
1999), approaching pre-East Asia crisis levels.

LENDING BY REGION AND SECTOR

New IBRD lending commitments in fiscal 2001
were highest for the Latin America and the
Caribbean (LAC) Region ($4.8 billion), followed
by the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Region
($2 2 bilhon)

Latin American countnes also accounted for
close to 69 percent of IBRD’s adjustment lending, half of it in phased, programmatic support
for medium-term policy reform and institutionbuilding efforts (for example, fiscal and financial
reform in Brazil, social sector reform in Peru,
and bank restructuring in Jamaica).

World Bank Cofinancing

Cofinancing* describes funds committed by official
bilateral partners, multilateral partners, export credit
agencies, or private sources to specific Bank-funded
projects. Partners include regional development banks,
multilateral partners such as those associated with
environmental agreements, and special program mechanisms, as well as private sector actors that provide
project financing The Bank's cofinancing figures
reflect the combining of Bank resources with those of
other donors in specific regions and sectors to support
clent country activities. The wider the partictpation in
the cofinancing effort, the greater the consensus on the
acttvities and policies supported.

Cofinancing in fiscal 2001 amounted to $5.47 billion.
Multilateral and bilateral partners contributed 85
percent of this amount. Major partners included the
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB—$1.9
billion); the Japan Bank for International Cooperation
($0.53 billion); and Kreditanstalt far Wiederaufbau
(KfW—$0.3 billion). This year’s cofinancing was
below the previous year's level ($9 3 billion), reflecting
unusually large volumes of cofinancing in fiscal 2000
for the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project ($3.4 bilhon) and in China ($0.4 billion).

The Latin America and the Caribbean Region
accounted for the largest share of cofinancing in
fiscal 2001 ($3.4 billion), followed by Africa ($1.12
bilhon) and Europe and Central Asia ($0.46 bilhon).
The major sectors attracting cofinancing were
public sector management ($1.2 billion), finance
($1 billion), and oil and gas ($0.9 billion).

In addition to cofinancing of $5.47 billion,
$2 billion was committed in fiscal 2001 under the
Strategic Partnership with Africa framework. The
commitment, which reflected close donor coordination on policies in the context of Poverty Reduction
Strategy Papers (in Benin and Uganda, for example),
was above the amount committed in fiscal 2000
($0.51 billion).

Trust funds are financial and administrative arrangements* that facilitate grant funding of high-priority

development needs, including technical assistance and

advisory services, debt relief, post-conflict transition,
and cofinancing. Trust funds help leverage poverty

reduction programs by funding key due diligence activities for development operations, promoting innovative

approaches, forging partnerships, and expanding the
scope of development collaboration.

In fiscal 2001:t
Total contributions expanded significantly, with

increased donor support for the Heavily Indebted

Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, a new Japan
Social Development Fund (JSDF) to help poor

and vulnerable groups hurt by crisis, a trust fund
for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and major
technical assistance and cofinancing projects.

Contributions totaled $2,719 million, comprising
$1,450 million from bilateral donors, $1,225 million from multilateral donors, and $44 million
from private sector and nongovernmental organizations.

Major contributions were provided by the
European Community ($757 million), the World
Bank Group ($422 million), Japan ($277 million), and the Netherlands ($235 million).

Contributions to ongoing, global programs
financed by Japan and the Netherlands included
$93 million for the JSDF, $59 million for the

Trust-Funded tnitlatives for Climate Change and Post-Conflict
Reconstruction

The Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF), established with the objective of mitigating
climate change, alms to promote sustainable development, demonstrate the possibilities of public-private partnerships, and offer a “learning-by-doing” opportunity to

stakeholders. PCF emphasizes renewable energy and energy efficiency projects that

have potential for reptication and for reducing climate change at a reasonable cost.

PCF Investments will be made in transition economies and developing countries foltowing the emerging framework of the Kyoto Protocol for its Joint Implementation
and Ctean Devetopment Mechanisms, respectively, By October 2000, the PCF had
subscribed capital of $145 miltion from 17 corporate and 6 public sector partici
pants. See www.PrototypeCarbonFund.org. ®

Trust funds increasingly support reconstruction and transition in post-confllct coun
tries and regions. Bank-financed trust funds provide credits (on IDA terms) and

grants to nonmember countries to support demobilization, hetp rebuild economies,

and develop key institutions. The Bank has catalyzed additional external donor

assistance to increase development impact in post-conflict situations. Special Bank

credits and grants for the West Bank and Gaza, East Timor, Kosovo, and the Federal

Republic of Yugoslavia totaled nearly $500 million in recent years, leveraged by an

additional $1 billion in grants from the larger donor community.

Water and Sanitation Sector. Five years ago, about half
the Water and Sanitation portfolio was at nsk, and problem projects accounted for nearly a quarter of the portfoho. At the end of fiscal 2001, only 15 percent of projects
were at risk The radical improvement has resulted from
A shift in lending away from public sector utilities that
promise reforms and toward utilities that have
reformed prior to Bank funding and brought private
sector talent into their operations, and
The Bank's adoption of a proactive approach toward
problem projects, including quantitative performance
targets and regular review and monitoring

The World Bank’s project portfolio of $105 billion
at the end of fiscal 2001 comprised 1,553 ongoing
projects, nearly a quarter of them in Afnca.

Measured in dollars as well as number of projects. the
distribution of the portfolio highlights the Bank's sustained emphasis on investments in people, rural
development with an environmental focus, and
infrastructure and institution building needed to
help countries attract private investment and reduce
poverty

The share of the portfolio in the energy as well as the
oil and gas sectors has fallen sharply over the past five
years, reflecting countries’ success in attracting private and other lenders into those sectors and the
Bank's focus on policy and institutional reform
Countnes with good policy and institutional environments account for a markedly higher share of the
portfolio today relative to fiscal 1996

Support for countnes’ efforts to combat corruption
and HIV/AIDS has been mainstreamed and is today
more than double what it was in fiscal 1996

The Bank continues to be a leader in providing reconstruction assistance following natural disasters, with
growing attention to disaster prevention In the last five
years, lending for reconstruction totaled nearly $5 billion,
and while difficult to quantify precisely, disaster prevention lending is approaching similar levels

Portfolio management by decentralized country
office staff has increased significantly, strengthening
the Bank's responsiveness to client needs and improving portfolio health.

Africa Region. Operations in the Afnca Region have hustorically faced above-average nsk because of conflict-related

Overview of World Bank Activities in Fiscal 2001

In fiscal 2001 the World Bank intensified its efforts
to help countries fight poverty. It accelerated support—yointly with the IMF—to help the world’s
poorest countries prepare poverty reduction strategies, thus advancing their eligibility for significant
debt relief. It heightened collaboration with global
partners around the international development goals
to enhance prospects for their achievement and, in
particular, to strengthen the fight against HIV/AIDS.
And it articulated a new Strategic Framework that
clarifies the key strategic directions of the Bank and
emphasizes the need to consolidate and build on the
significant progress of recent years.

GLOBAL CONTEXT: SLOWING RECOVERY, SLOW
PROGRESS ON POVERTY REDUCTION

During 2000, the world economy continued its
remarkable recovery from the 1997-98 financial crisis, but momentum faded as the year progressed.
GDP growth of developing countries averaged 5.4
percent in 2000, a shade above the previous year.
The fastest-growing region was East Asia and
Pacific, at 7.5 percent, Sub-Saharan Africa trailed
with 2.7 percent growth. South Asia continued on a
steady growth path despite a major earthquake in
India Accelerated reform also helped growth in
Europe and Central Asia's developing countries,
boosted by the rise of Russian oil revenues to a
record level, resolving setbacks to financial stability
and attracting private investment remain challenges
for the region Latin America, on the whole, also
recovered well, benefiting from a return to stability
of global financial markets. Growth in the Middle
East and North Africa continued, but serious challenges include the continued political uncertainty
and high unemployment in the region. For the world
as a whole, slower growth is expected for 2001.
Progress on poverty reduction has been slow,
and the challenge of the international development
goals remains immense (see page 4) Prospects for
success, in some areas, are improving, however
Between 1990 and 1998 the proportion of people living in extreme poverty fell from 29 percent to 23 per
cent, with China leading the decline. In at least 25
developing countries, infant mortality rates have been
dechning, putting them within likely reach of the
2015 infant mortality goal. The gaps between girls’
and boys’ enrollments have narrowed. But other data
are sobering: estimates show that more than 113 million children remain out of school, 150 million children remain underweight, and maternal deaths
average 440 per 100,000 in developing countries
(compared with 21 in high-income countries)
HIV/AIDS continues to present a formidable obstacle to reaching the goals, although a few countries
are beginning to reap successes from prevention programs. And many countries, on present trends, are not
on track to halving their poverty incidence by 2015.

FISCAL 2001 ASSISTANCE: FOCUS ON POVERTY,
QUALITY

Higher lending volumes and special financing. At
$17.3 billion, new lending in fiscal 2001 was modestly above the previous year's level for IBRD and
IDA combined (table 1.1). The increase resulted
from higher IDA lending to Africa, consistent with
IDA-12 goals and in particular to respond to the
HIV/AIDS crisis, post-conflict situations, and oil
price shocks A multicountry, fast-track program for
Afnca to intensify the fight against HIV/AIDS
deserves special mention for its innovativeness as
well as scope for scaling up development impact
(box 1.1). Overall, new IDA lending focused on
investments aimed at reducing poverty, including
investments in the social sectors and rural and
community-driven development. Demand from
IBRD borrowers, particularly in Europe and Central
Asia and Latin America, was centered on strengthening financial sectors, investing in people, improving public sector management, and addressing needs
in the transport sector. Institution building remained
a strong priority. With respect to the number of
projects, the year’s total of 225 was about the same
as last year, with IDA operations reaching a firsttime-ever 60 percent of the total. The average size
of operations increased to $77 million in fiscal 2001

a To better capture the evolving nature of Bank operations, the Bank's sector classification system is reviewed and changed as appropriate In fiscal 2000, two new
sector categories were created (Economic Policy and Private Sector Development) and one sector category was dropped (Industry) Economic Policy comprises operations that support macroeconomic policy, trade, and other economic and institutional reforms ft includes structural adjustment operations previously assigned to
Multisector and some operations previously assigned to Finance Private Sector Development comprises operations dealing with the business environment, private
infrastructure, small scale enterprise, and privatization issues As such, it includes some operations previously assigned to Industry and to Public Sector Management
Other operations previously included under Industry have been assigned to the Public Sector Management sector In addition, a few individual operations approved
in fiscal 1998-99 were reassigned, including a fiscal 1999 project from Agriculture to Water Supply and Sanitation

Accelerated debt relief. Significant progress was
made in fiscal 2001 to provide deeper, broader, and
faster debt relief to some of the world’s poorest countries, many of them im Afnica, under the enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) InitiativeBox 1.1 The Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP)
for Africa

The HIV/AIDS epidemic now poses the paramount threat to
development in Sub-Saharan Africa. About 25 million adults and
children are living with HIV/AIDS, as estimated by the Joint
United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (December 2000).
Some 17 million have already died from the disease, which may
be costing the region 0.5 percent to 1.2 percent of per capita
growth each year, with losses likely to grow.

In collaboration with partners (see page 103), the Bank
launched in September 2000 the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS
Program (MAP) for Africa—the first of its kind. Under MAP,
flextble and rapid funding will be committed, on IDA terms,
to individual HIV/AIDS projects developed by countries
" The MAP seeks to dramatically increase access—especially

by vulnerable groups—to HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and
treatment programs.

Communities and associations of people affected by
HIV/AIDS will hetp design and implement activities and will
control resources.

Countries benefiting from the MAP in fiscat 2001 include
Cameroon, Eritrea, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya,

and Uganda.

An mitial amount of $500 million covers the first of three
phases. Phase 1 (expected to be fully committed by the end
of calendar 2001) aims to help as many countries as possible
intensify action against HIV/AIDS and cope with the unprecedented burdens of the epidemic. Phases 2 and 3, respectively, will stress mainstreaming and prevention.

The MAP aims ultimately to avert millions of HiV infections,
alleviate suffering for tens of millions, and protect the development prospects of entire nations.

framework As of June 30, 2001, 23 countries—
compared with 7 a year ago—were receiving debt
relief under this framework, amounting to more than
$34 billion over time from all creditors. Importantly,
debt rehef has begun to be delivered within a transparent and comprehensive Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) framework. PRSPs (discussed on page 30 under “Support to low-income
countnies”) are developed by countries after national
consultations and aim to ensure a nationally “owned”
poverty reduction framework for spending resources
freed by debt relief. In addition, debt relief is delivered only to countries that have demonstrated the
commitment and capacity to use the resources effectively After HIPC (and combined with traditional)
debt relief, the 23 countries will:

(such as poverty and gender assessments, public
expenditure reviews, financial accountabihty, and
procurement assessments), 75 other diagnostic
reports (such as institutional and governance
reviews, financial sector assessments, social protection reviews, and city development strategies); and
97 regional and country advisory reports. The Africa
and Europe and Central Asia regions accounted for
the highest share of the year's ESW ESW provides
the basis for the Bank’s policy dialogue with clients.
When undertaken in partnership with local institutions, it 1s also an effective vehicle for building institutional capacity. It underpins the country’s own
vision and the Bank’s diagnosis of the country’s
development situation; it provides the analytical
basis for HIPC and PRSP work in IDA countries;
and it plays an important role in middle-income
countries—underscored by the Development
Committee's call for stronger analysis of structural,
social, and sectoral issues and priorities. ESW helps
the Bank develop its Country Assistance Strategies
(CASs) and formulate and implement effective lending programs. In fiscal 2001 the Bank continued a
reform effort to strengthen ESW and fill gaps in the
availability of diagnostic reports, particularly in key
areas such as public expenditure, procurement and
financial management, and structural constraints to
growth and poverty reduction.

Multidimensional support for poverty reduction.
Released in September 2000, the Bank's World
Development Report 2000/2001 emphasized opportunity, empowerment, and secunty as key to reducing
multidimensional poverty. Examples of the Bank's
efforts to reflect in its work the report's conclusions,
through lending and nonlending services, include
the following:
Lending to fight communicable diseases amounted
to over $610 million—twice the average for the
past four years, and including over $418 million
from IDA; support to combat HIV/AIDS and
malaria has intensified, while the Bank is already
the largest single source of external support for
tuberculosis control in developing countries.
Support for education 1s emphasizing access,
quality, and equity, as of June 30, 2001, the
Bank has supported 64 active projects worldwide with girls’ education components; 55 of

The World Bank Annual Report 2001

these projects benefited from IDA financing.
Also to benefit the vulnerable, the Bank is not only
steadily expanding its social protection portfolio—
whose quality is also improving—but also working
at the global level, for example with the Intemational
Labour Organisation and the United Nations
Children’s Fund, to fight child labor.

Working toward a cleaner, healthier ennronment
has entailed extensive global consultations to
inform a forthcoming environmental strategy, collaborative efforts to better manage Nile water
resources, and more environmentally focused support for the energy, oil and gas, and mining sectors.
Other progress to empower people is reflected in
collaborative work’on the Global Development
Gateway—an initiative to make worldwide development knowledge more widely and interactively
accessible—as well as using Bank lending to help
build countries’ information systems (75 percent
of Bank projects have such components)

A wide range of Bank Group services supports private sector development, ranging from investment
climate surveys (of places as diverse as East Timor
and the Russian Federation) and support for pnvate provision of infrastructure to catalytic lending
and innovative finance, including guarantees

A fast-growing area of support is law and justice,
where Bank focus has evolved from specific law
reform to encompass legal education for the public, anticorruption programs in the judiciary,
indigenous dispute resolution mechanisms, and
legal aid for poor women.

A-new operational policy to guide conflict-related
work allows for a more systematic approach,
including, in the area of conflict prevention,
studies to identify root causes, support for transparent public expenditure management, and varied operational support (for demobilization and
reintegration, for example).

Improved development effectiveness. The number
of projects considered “at risk” in the Bank’s portfolio
has been cut in half over the past five years and is
now the lowest it has been in many years. As a
result, some $16 billion of loans and credits are better positioned to deliver results to chents. The
quality of project appraisal and supervision has also
improved substantially, a similar trend 1s emerging
with respect to nonlending services. These results are
beginning to be reflected steadily in improved projectoutcomes: the independent Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) estimates that 78 percent of
closed projects had satisfactory outcomes in fiscal
2000, compared with 73 percent in fiscal 1999
Institutional development and sustainability of
results are also improving, slowly but steadily.
Particularly noteworthy are quality improvements in
the Africa region, which reflect in part IDA’s growing
effort to focus new lending on countries with good
policy performance The quality of adjustment lending has also improved markedly. Also notable toward
ensuring more effective use of aid is the greater
attention, Bank-wide, to safeguard and fiduciary
policies. Highlights include an improved tracking
system, recognizing the potentially high social and environmental costs of noncompliance; efforts to harmonize safeguard requirements across donors, and a
steady strengthening of project financial management
resulting from systematic efforts to improve governance
and cost effectiveness. A growing prionty of OED is to
strengthen borrowers’ capacity for evaluation.

PRESERVING FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO SUPPORT
DEVELOPMENT NEEDS

IBRD net income in fiscal 2001 was $1.5 million,
lower than the previous year primarily because of
higher provisioning expenses. IBRD retained $618
million out of fiscal 2001 operating income in its
General Reserve—lower than in the previous year,
when $1 1 billion was retained in keeping with
IBRD's strategy to preserve long-term financial
strength and support other development needs. As
part of its regular financing operations, IBRD raised
$17 billion in international debt markets in fiscal
2001. It continued to borrow at favorable costs, in
turn enabling low borrowing costs for client countries Funding volume was above the previous year's
level, reflecting financing for loan disbursements and
refinancing of debt retirements. IBRD maintained
adequate liquidity in fiscal 2001 to ensure unintertupted cash flow to meet its obligations. As of June
30, 2001, the liquid asset portfolio was $24.2 billion.

pilots that tested a community-based approach to provide faster access to
land by the rural poor, thereby helping raise the incomes of about 50,000
families.

Regional integration. The Regional Trade Facilitation Project (IDA, $110
million) —the first of its kind —will support poverty reduction through private sector-led growth in seven African countries, helping increase credit
availability for productive activities and providing startup funds for the
Africa Trade Insurance Agency.

Social protection. The Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project
and the Emergency Recovery Proyect (IDA, $400 million) will have a significant impact on reducing poverty in war-torn Ethiopia by helping veterans
restart their lives and jump-starting the economy, while also addressing
basic needs and scaling up HIV/AIDS-related interventions.

Finance. The Second Poverty Alleviation Microfinance Project (IDA, $151
million) expands rural microcredit in Bangladesh to reach those who have
to date been left out or underserved, while also ensuring that microlending
will be sustainable into the future; 1 2 million new borrowers and 19,500
microentrepreneurs are expected to benefit.

Education. The Mali Education Sector Expenditure Program (IDA, $45 million) is a 10-year program aimed at increasing gross primary enrollment
from about 56 percent in 2000 to 95 percent in 2010, helping Mali’s future
ability to respond to competitive market conditions.

Transport. The Third Inland Waterways Project (1BRD, $100 million) will
improve market access of, and power supply to, remote inland areas of
China’s Hunan province and provide more economic inland waterway transport, reducing transport bottlenecks, strengthening institutional capacity,
and benefiting nearly six million poor residents.

Natural disasters. The Natural Disaster Management Project (IBRD, $404
million) will help reduce human, economic, and financial costs of natural disasters in Mexico by focusing on recovery and prevention of loss of life and
infrastructure damage.

Public sector reform. The Budget Systems Modernization Project (IBRD,
$24 million) will modernize and expand Algeria's capacity for growth by
promoting efficient, transparent, and effective governance,

Environment. Russia’s Coal and Forestry Sector Guarantee Facility (IBRD,
$200 million) will help foster a better business environment in the coal and
forestry sectors and support commercially viable enterprises.

Water supply. The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (IDA, $20 million) will expand sustainable water supply and improve sanitation service
coverage to over 400,000 of the Republic of Yemen's mostly poor rural population, improving health and freeing girls from water-fetching chores to
attend school.

that, after July 1, 2002, each IDA CAS presented to
the Bank’s Board would normally be based on a
PRSP, which would provide the context for all IDA
lending and nonlending activities The Board has
already considered a number of CASs based on
PRSPs, including Burkina Faso and Uganda. A total
of 17 of the year's CASs were prepared jointly with
the IFC, underscoring the importance of private
investment to these countries’ strategies While the
poverty focus of CASs has been improving, the Bank
has been steadily raising the standard for its assistance. Key priorities include good poverty diagnosis,
integration of economic and sector work, selectivity
m assistance, appropriate sequencing of instruments,
and capacity building to monitor PRSP outcome
indicators—currently a major challenge Projects
approved over the past year attest to the strong
poverty focus of Bank assistance (box 1.2)

Support to low-income countries. The Boards of
the Bank and the IMF considered Full and Intenm
PRSPs prepared by 32 countries in fiscal 2001,
compared with 12 the previous year. Since their
introduction in December 1999, PRSPs have
become the principal vehicle for implementing the
principles of the CDF in low-income countries. The
accelerated preparation of PRSPs (including 29
Interim ones to enable countries’ preliminary qualification for debt rehef under the enhanced HIPC
framework) signals progress, but the strong participatory process, still to come in the Full PRSPs, will
be crucial. The approach 1s still in its early stages,
linking pubhe actions to pnority poverty reduction
outcomes will be critical as the process evolves
Progress of a different kind—donor coordination—
1s reflected in the European Union's decision to
base its assistance to the Africa, Caribbean, and
Pacific regions on the PRSP framework. Growing
adoption of the PRSP approach attests to the
expanding acceptance of CDF principles, which
emphasize country ownership based on national
consensus and strong participatory processes, longterm vision, results focus, and partnersmp. The
Bank’s Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC)
will help implement these strategies On May 31,
2001, the Board of the World Bank approved a
$150 million PRSC for Uganda, the first IDA credit
to support the implementation of a country’s
poverty reduction strategy as set out in its PRSP(see page 43) A PRSC for Vietnam was also
approved in fiscal 2001.

Support to middle-income countries. With the
support of Ministers at the Joint Bank-Fund Annual
Meetings in September 2000, the Bank Group created a task force to consider how best to respond to
the needs of middle-income countries (those eligible
to borrow from IBRD). A clear consensus emerged
from extensive consultations with client countries,
shareholders, and other partners the Bank Group
has a crucial role to play in middle-income countries With nearly 80 percent of people who hve on
under $2 a day residing in middle-income countries,
any plan for successful global poverty reduction will
require the Bank’s continued active engagement in
these countries The Bank's global reach, broad sectoral knowledge, and specific private sector engagement through the IFC and MIGA enable it to
provide strong support for sound policies and institutions, its financial support “crowds in” private capital and reduces vulnerability to market volatility,
and, through its work in middle-income countries,
the Bank gains valuable experience, informing its
work in low-income countries The task force highlights, however, the need for a catalytic and selective
tole, with the Bank focusing on assistance that
others cannot or will not provide. At the Joint BankFund Spring Meetings in April 2001, Ministers welcomed the task force—based proposals put forward
by the Bank noting that they would support more
structured and streamlined Bank-Fund cooperation.
Proposals included the strengthening of the Bank's
analysis of the country situation, including expanding, in concert with its partners, support for local
capacity building, a deferred drawdown option

for adjustment loans to reforming countries, and

a more systematic and developmental role for
adjustment lending.

Support for global public goods. The 2000 Annual
Meetings also set near-term priorities for Bank
engagement in global collective action: communicable diseases, environmental commons, economic
governance and financial stability, trade and integration; and the formation and knowledge revolution.
The Bank has since moved forward in each of these
areas, whose links to poverty reduction are strong
Progress has consisted of sharpening strategy, work
ing with global partners on mayor initiatives, and
integrating efforts into country-level work An urgent
task at the international level 1s to develop solid estimates of financing requirements for each priority
area That pending, the Bank 1s relying on innovative
IBRD and IDA program and project lending to support strong national programs (such as the MultiCountry HIV/AIDS Program) as a basis for later
global approaches, while also exploring a hmited
expansion of IDA’s grant capability and a restructuring of the Bank’s Development Grant Facility The
Bank's approach toward global public goods 1s based
on careful selectivity in priorities and partnerships,
and measured deployment of resources.

Sector Strategy Papers (SSPs). SSPs help organize
the Bank's work on global priorities such as disease
eradication or the environment. They are a launching
point for promoting public action at the global level,
pulling together global programs and partnerships,
and providing incentives for chent countries to take
action. More generally, SSPs help shape the Bank's
approach and activities in a given sector or thematic
area to enhance impact on poverty reduction and
growth SSPs also lay out strategic options for sector
and thematic areas identifying aspects of relatively
weak country performance for priority attention They
are developed with broad stakeholder consultation,
and their implementation 1s regularly monitored. In
fiscal 2001 the Board reviewed three SSPs, including
“Strategy for the Financial Sector,” “Reforming Public
Institutions and Strengthening Governance A World
Bank Strategy,” and “Social Protection Sector
Strategy. From Safety Net to Spring Board ”

A CHANGING WORLD BANK

Compact Assessment. In fiscal 2001 the Bank conducted an assessment of the Strategic Compact,
launched in April 1997 between the Bank and its
shareholders to renew itself to become more effective,
with $250 million in additional administrative
resources over a three-year period. The Compact was
ambitious 1n its time frame and scope, the challenge
was heightened by unanticipated external developments—financial crises, post-conflict situations, and
natural disasters—as well as the nsing demands of
partnership linked to the CDF-PRSP-HIPC work in
many countries

agenda, retool its knowledge base, and revamp institutional capabilities. Important gains have been
made in improving operational quality and expanding the Bank's portfolio of products and services
(table 1.2) A changed Bank has meant making

presence in the field. The Bank has also delivered
on its commitment to return in fiscal 2001 to the
fiscal 1997 net administrative budget in real terms.
The efficiency gains foreseen under the
Compact have proved more difficult to realize. A
number of new priorities and processes have
increased the complexity and—in the short term—
the cost of doing business. Supervision costs are
higher because of the greater emphasis on quality as
well as compliance with safeguard and fiduciary
policies; the costs of preparing CASs have risen in
step with growing attention to stakeholder consultations and disclosure; and the introduction of servicesTable 1.3 Aligning Resources with Corporate Priorities: Selected Items in the Bank’s Budget

terms of the stress levels of staff, who played a crucial role in the progress made under the Compact.
Lessons from the Compact experience are reflected
in the Strategic Directions Paper (SDP) as well as in
the Bank's admimistrative budget for fiscal 2002,
approved at the end of fiscal 2001 (see table | 3).

World Bank Institute (WBI). A major emphasis of
the “new” Bank is empowerment of people through
knowledge and capacity building. Renewed during
the Compact period, WBI 1s an important
contributor to this objective (others being the Bank's
research and advisory services, its thematic networks’
“communities of practice,” and information technology—based efforts) WBI facilitates learning on
development issues for staff as well as Bank
chents—including policymakers, ministry staff,
academics, and increasingly, parhamentarians, journalists, the private sector, nongovernmental
organizations, and other segments of civil society. At
the end of fiscal 2001, WBI was reaching 48,000
participants annually in client programs in about 150
countries through nearly 600 learning activities.
Programs continue to be scaled up through distance
learning, global knowledge networks, and extended
partnerships, and by harnessing the newest learning

STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK AND
FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Strategic Framework. Aimed at building on the
progress made under the Compact, a Strategic
Framework Paper and an SDP were presented to the
Board in fiscal 2001 (see page 9) The papers reiterate the Bank’s mission of fighting poverty, with the
international development goals representing a prime
commitment They set out the two inter-related pillars that will underpin Bank assistance to countnies
and at the global level building the climate for
investment, jobs, and sustainable growth, and
empowering poor people to participate in develop
The World Bank Annuat Report 2001

ment The SDP emphasizes a catalytic role coupled
with the need for selectivity along three dimensions—within countries, across countries, and for
global programs The Bank will articulate in the CAS
its selectivity within a country, use income, poverty,
and performance as the key cniteria for selectivity
across countries, and be guided by corporate and
global public goods prionties at the global level In
addition, the papers center assistance to low-income
countries on CDF-based poverty reduction strategies
as well as debt rehef and post-conflict needs, while
clarifying the Bank’s role in middle-income countries
and at the global level

Role of partners. The strategy papers emphasize the
central role of collaboration with partners at the country, as well as global, level. Closely involving client
governments, civil society, the private sector, and multilateral and bilateral partners at all stages and levels
of country assistance—policy dialogue, formulation of
Bank CASs, and design and implementation of lending and nonlending services—has become the norm.
Collaboration with major institutional partners, such
as the IMF and the United Nations (U N.), has
intensified. Operational cooperation and coordination
with multilateral development banks (MDBs) has
advanced significantly, and several technical working
groups are launching efforts to promote coherence in
approaches and harmonization of policies and procedures (on matters ranging from environmental assessments and financial management to corruption and
gender). For global public goods, strategic partnerships with national governments, civil society, international organizations, bilateral donors, and the
corporate sector have become fundamental to the
Bank’s engagement. In many arenas, jomt work with
UN agencies, the IMF, and MDBs 1s crucial
Important examples are the Global Alhance for
Vaccines and Immunization focusing on prevention of
communicable diseases, the Financial Stability Forum
helping to prevent and manage financual crises, the
Prototype Carbon Fund that addresses climate
change issues, the Global Development Gateway
aimed at increasing access worldwide to development
knowledge, and work with the World Trade
Organization and other partners on integrating least
developed countries into the multilateral trade system.

Future Directions. For all the collective progress
noted in this report, the world has far to go to win
the fight against poverty, The Bank Group has an

important role to play Core assets are its financial
strength, experience and knowledge, global reach,Table 1.4 Cumulative IDA Subscriptions and Contributions, as of June 30, 2001

independence that enables objectivity, ability to
integrate the major elements of sustainable development, and capacity to deliver services and resources
to countries. Going forward, the Bank will maintain
its global diagnostic capacity across the whole range
of developmental sectors, while being much more
selective in its areas of implementation capacity.
Increasing effectiveness will continue to be a priority, built around a strong quality culture. Country
focus will dominate Bank assistance, complemented
by carefully selected cross-border and global issues.
Measuring the Bank's performance—particularly
difficult in areas such as policy support and capacity building—will also be important, as will be the
transparent reporting of results.

As laid out in the Strategy Framework Paper,
Bank assistance will emphasize governance as well
as institutional and policy structures, including the
regulatory framework for infrastructure, to create a
positive investment climate—key to expanding jobs
and achieving sustainable growth. It will equally
emphasize the need to invest in people and
empower them to participate in development, in
part through community-driven development.
Building poor people's assets, promoting gender
equality, and protecting the most vulnerable will all
be central to the poverty reduction effort. Investment
and adjustment lending will both be set in the context of a sound program of policy and institutional
development, capacity building, and strong government commitment.

Partnership, based on institutional comparative
advantages will be key to progress at the country,

regional, and global levels. There is now unprecedented consensus worldwide on what is needed for
poverty reduction. The Bank has called for a “compact” between rich and poor countries, with each
doing its part. Rich countries need to increase
market access to developing countries’ exports, and
provide debt relief and new concessional finance
for the poorest countries; developing countries, for
their part, need to ensure sound policy and institutional environments to promote growth as well as
the effective use of aid, making sure also that the
benefits of growth reach poor people. The CAS
will continue to spell out the Bank’s focused business strategy in support of a country’s program,
working in partnership with governments and
together with the IMF, MDBs, the U.N, bilateral
agencies, the private sector, and civil society. The
IDA-13 Replenishment, which is expected to be
decided by the end of calendar 2001, will crucially
guide the Bank's efforts going forward; IDA donors
(table 1.4) have been considering ways to increase
aid effectiveness. Collaboration with the IMF will
continue to be paramount. The agenda with
MDBs includes harmonizing operational policies
and division of labor on countries’ social and structural issues. Division of labor on global public
goods will be the shared challenge in work with
the U.N. The Bank will be flexible, explicitly stepping back where another partner's comparative
advantage is clear.

Overview 3Chapter 2
The Board of Executive Directors

 

The Executive Directors are responsible for the
conduct of the World Bank's general operations;
they perform their duties under powers delegated by
the Board of Governors As provided in the Articles
of Agreement, 5 of the 24 Executive Directors are
appointed by the member countnies having the
largest number of shares, the rest are elected by the
other member countries, which form constituencies
in an election process conducted every two years.
Executive Directors consider and decide on
IBRD loan and guarantee proposals and IDA credit
and guarantee proposals made by the President, and
they decide on policies that guide the Bank’s general
operations. They are also responsible for presenting to
the Board of Governors, at the Annual Meetings, an
audit of accounts, an administrative budget, and an
Annual Report (this report) on the Bank's operations
and policies as well as other matters Their oversight
responsibility covers all Bank policies and activities,
including approval of all lending and guarantee operations and the annual budget In shaping Bank policy,
the Board of Executive Directors (the Board) takes
into account the evolving perspectives of member
countnies on the role of the Bank Group as well as
the Bank's operational experience In this regard, an
important role is played by the Operations Evaluation

also play an active role in preparing the agenda and
issues papers for the semiannual meetings of the
joint Bank-Fund Development Committee. In fiscal
2001 the Development Committee addressed the
World Bank's strategy in middle-income countnes,
poverty reduction and global public goods, assistance to post-conflict countries, and a number of the
issues discussed below. (For more detail, see appendix 12 in volume 2 of this Annual Report.)

STRATEGIC ISSUES

Major areas of Board emphasis during fiscal 2001
are highhghted below.

Strategic Framework. During fiscal 2001 management presented the Executive Directors with several
papers on the strategic directions for the Bank
Group for the fiscal 2002-04 period, including the
Strategic Framework Paper, the Strategic Compact
Assessment, and the Strategic Directions Papers for
the Bank and the IFC The Board reviewed the proposals, expressing strong support for increased selectivity in Bank activities to help member countries
achieve the international development goals as a
means to address more efficiently the central goal of
poverty reduction. They also discussed several
important policy papers—for example the Bank’s
middle-income country strategy

Bank Group’s role in poverty reduction. The
Board continued to closely monitor implementation
of the Bank Group's poverty reduction mandate.
Executive Directors reviewed a number of povertyrelated reports, including a paper on the operational
implications of the World Development Report
2000/2001 on attacking poverty, and the annual
Poverty Progress Report The Board also focused
considerable attention on implementation of the
enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative for debt relief to low-income countries, as
well as the related Poverty Reduction Strategy
Papers (PRSPs) and Interim PRSPs (1-PRSPs)
designed to ensure stronger links between debt relief
and poverty reduction Directors considered 28

The World Bank Annual Report 2001

HIPC documents (covering 23 countries) under the
enhanced framework (comprising 10 Preliminary, 16
Decision Point, and 2 Completion Point documents), and stressed the importance of full burden
sharing by all creditors.' They also reviewed 3
PRSPs and 29 I-PRSPs, and expressed appreciation
for the tangible progress made in implementation of
the PRSP process They suggested several areas for
improvement, including better alignment of Bank
assistance with countries’ own strategies and their
implementation capacities. The Board also approved
the first two Poverty Reduction Support Credits to
Uganda and Vietnam In addition, the Board
reviewed papers on tracking poverty-related
spending in HIPCs, and discussed the impact of
debt reduction on long-term debt sustainability

The Board also discussed a number of sector
strategy papers designed to help define the Bank's
role in poverty reduction at the sector level, including strategies for reforming public institutions and
strengthening governance, social protection, and the
financial sector

Country programs. Country Assistance Strategies
(CASs) and the principles underlying the Comprehensive Development Framework and PRSPs
continued to guide the Bank Group's work at the
country level. During the fiscal year the Board considered 37 CASs and related CAS products
Directors commended the greater focus on poverty
reduction as the overarching goal, as well as the
increasing use of consultative processes in preparing
CASs. They also stressed the importance of the
Bank’s increasing use of partnerships and selectivity
at the country level.

Global programs and partnerships. Participation
by the Bank in global initiatives and partnerships has
increased significantly in recent years In fiscal 2001
the Board discussed a framework for managing
global programs and partnerships to reinforce countrylevel poverty reduction efforts. It reviewed several

reforms and policies outlined in a country’s PRSPreports on global public goods Executive Directors
confirmed five priority areas for Bank engagement
communicable diseases, environmental commons,
economic governance and financial stability, trade
integration, and information and knowledge. They
also discussed several initratives within these priority
areas, such as the Bank’s work with the IMF to
strengthen the international financial architecture,
with particular emphasis on the integrity of financial
markets and the implementation of standards and
codes. The Board discussed the Development Grant
Facihty, which provides grant financing for several
of these initiatives, including activities relating to
HIV/AIDS The Board has also been involved in
preparations for the Umted Nations High-Level
Event on Financing for Development In addition,
the Board remained focused on the Bank's engagement with civil society and NGOs, whose role in
the discussion of development issues has become
more pronounced

OVERSIGHT AND FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY

The Board exercises oversight and fiduciary responsibility on behalf of its shareholders, in part through
its Audit Committee. The Committee reviewed its
terms of reference to reflect the evolving duties and
responsibilities of audit committees in an ever more
complex and risky environment The Committee
advises the Board on financial nsk management and
other governance issues to facilitate Board decisions
on policy issues.

ADMINISTRATIVE BUDGET

Following review by the Budget Committee,
Executive Directors approved an administrative
budget, net of rermbursements, for fiscal 2001 of
$1,442.2 milhon This total budget included an allocation of $146 9 million for the Development Grant
Facility The administrative budget was below the

level agreed on at the outset of the Strategic
Compact despite increased demands on the Bank
that had not been anticipated at the time of the
Compact In June 2001 the Executive Directors
approved a total administrative budget, net of rcimbursements, of $1,589 7 million for fiscal 2002

INSPECTION PANEL

The Board created an independent Inspection Panel
in 1993 to address more closely the concerns of people affected by Bank projects by ensuring that the
Bank adheres to its operational policies and procedures in the design, preparation, and implementation of proyects Any group of individuals believing
that they may be harmed by a Bank-supported proyect may ask the panel to investigate complaints that
such harm stems from the Bank's failure to abide by
its policies and procedures. The Executive Directors
decide, on the recommendation of the Panel,
whether an investigation will take place

In fiscal 2001 the Board considered the Panel
Investigation Report and the Bank Management recommendations on the Qinghai component of the
China Western Poverty Reduction Project No further Board action was taken after the Chinese government announced that it would undertake and
finance the Qinghai component entirely with its
own resources and on its own terms, as it could not
accept additional conditionality The Board approved
and the Panel conducted two other investigations of
projects in Kenya and Ecuador that looked at application of the Bank’s policies on environmental
assessment, consultation with or participation by
local people, and Bank supervision In both cases,
the Board approved management's recommended
actions in response to the Panel's investigation
reports The Panel received two new requests for
Inspection concerning the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline

Addressing the Social, Institutional, and Economic Dimensions

of Poverty

 

In fiscal 2001 the World Bank intensified efforts

to address many of the social, institutional, and
economic issues underlying poverty. In close partnership with the IMF, it accelerated implementation
of a country-owned approach to development that
firmly links poverty reduction to debt relief and concessional lending It also promoted good governance
and effective public institutions—both critical for
sustained poverty reduction In addition, the Bank 1s
helping developmg countries pursue gender equality
and integrate into the global economy, while working
at the global level to strengthen the international
financial architecture

Much Bank lending to support improved economic management, policies, and institutions falls
under the umbrella of adjustment lending Adjustment
lending promotes sustained growth and poverty
reduction by supporting countries’ efforts to undertake structural and social reforms (see table 3 1, and
table 8 14 in About the World Bank).

ACCELERATING SUPPORT FOR POVERTY
REDUCTION STRATEGIES

In December 1999 the Bank and the IMF launched
the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)

The World Bank Annual Report 2001

Poverty has many faces it is hunger or homelessness it is being sick
and not being able to see a doctor It is fear for the future, ving one
day at a time And it 1s not having power, representation, or freedom

Program to accelerate poverty reduction in lowincome countries PRSPs provide the basis for debt
relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Imitiative and for concessional
Bank and Fund lending They identify key obstacles
to poverty reduction and lay out a plan to overcome
those obstacles, with mechanisms to monitor progress
The country-driven nature of PRSPs 1s the program’s
most notable feature the strategies are produced by
the countries themselves in broad consultation with
civil society and poor people—marking an important
shift in culture for the Bank and the Fund. (See
box 3 1)

The PRSP Program gained considerable
momentum 1m fiscal 2001 A total of 29 countries
presented Interim PRSPs (I-PRSPs), in many cases
to qualify for preliminary HIPC debt relief. In addition, 3 countnes presented their first Full PRSPs in
fiscal 2001 Over the past year, the Bank has sought
to better align its country assistance with countries’
visions and priorities as laid out in PRSPs The
Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) was
troduced in fiscal 2001 to support an IDA-eligiblecountry’s policy and institutional reform program to
help implement its poverty reduction strategy (box
3.2). The PRSC 1s grounded in the principles of the
Comprehensive Development Framework and the
international development goals It 1s derived from
the PRSP, based on the Country Assistance Strategy,
and underpinned by suitable analysis—-environmental, social, structural, and fiduciary. Over time, it 1s
expected to become an important vehicle of IDA
financial support to low-income countries with
strong programs, anchoring the Bank's overall support for their poverty reduction strategies

The PRSP approach 1s still at an early stage.
The process was concewved as a broad framework for
engaging domestic stakeholders and external development partners, while providing a vehicle for
improved aid coordination Regional development
banks, United Nations development agencies, most
bilateral donors, the European Union, and many
nongovernmental organizations have indicated support for the approach and an intention to work with
countries in the PRSP process At the same time,
the process entails steadfast endeavor over the long
term Only when countries reduce poverty—an
impact that can be observed only over a number of
years—can PRSPs claim success.

FULFILLING PROMISES OF ENHANCED
DEBT RELIEF

Fiscal 2001 was an important year for the HIPC
Initiative. Building on enhancements in September
1999 emphasizing deeper, broader, and faster debt
relief and stronger links to poverty reduction, debt
relief was committed for an additional 16 countries
Benin, Cameroon, Chad, The Gambia, Guinea,
Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar,
Malawi, Mali, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tomé
and Principe, and Zambia As a result of the HIPC
Initiative, the 23 countries that have reached their
decision points’ under the enhanced framework will
receive more than $34 billion in debt service relief
over time from all creditors. This amount is equivalent in net present value (NPV) terms to nearly half
of their total stock of external debt In combination

1 Decision point The point at which the international community
agrees—for countries with unsustainable debt levels and a solid record
on economic reform and poverty reduction programs—on the amount
of relief needed to reduce outstanding debt to a sustainable level
Multilateral creditors, including IDA, begin providing significant “interIm assistance” beginning immediately at the decision point

 

Box 3.1 Poverty-Reducing Spending in Full and Interim PRSPs

All PRSPs and I-PRSPs seek to shift public spending toward poverty-reducing
programs.

Most country strategies propose to:

@ Enhance access of the poor to primary education and health-care services, and

@ Emphasize infrastructure programs in water, roads, electricity, and
telecommunications.

Some also propose to:

1 Provide housing to the poor, and

® Strengthen social safety nets to include food subsidies or other food security
programs, social assistance programs, and labor-intensive public works.

To monitor progress, some countries explicitly target yearly reductions in the
incidence of poverty. Intermediate targets often measure progress in enrollment,
infant mortality rates, incidence of communicable diseases, and, in some countries, gender disparities.

Box 3.2 The Uganda Poverty Reduction Support Credit

On May 31, 2001, the Board of the World Bank approved a $150 million PRSC
for Uganda to support the implementation of the country’s poverty reduction
strategy set out in Uganda’s PRSP. The PRSC is the first of a planned series of
three World Bank operations to support Uganda’s medium-term development
and reform program. The President’s Report for the Uganda PRSC has been
disclosed and made publicly available at the World Bank’s InfoShop.

The Uganda PRSC, the first IDA credit supporting the implementation of
a PRSP, supports policy and institutional measures in the government’s strategy, with a focus on improving public service delivery through (1) efficient and
equitable use of public resources, (2) improved governance through crosscutting public sector reforms, and (3) improved access to and quality of education, health care, and water and sanitation services. The PRSC builds ona
broad range of economic and sector work carried out in Uganda— including
household surveys, an enterprise survey, surveys to assess public service
delivery and corruption, and diagnostic reports such as the Country Financial
Accountability Assessment and Country Procurement Assessment. It supports
the government's anticorruption action plan and helps to create an effective
incentive system to improve service delivery,

The participatory process used to develop the government’s poverty
teduction strategy that underpins the PRSP Program broadened the country’s
ownership of the reforms, and a large number of partners are ready to support
their implementation. The multisector, programmatic approach promotes
Uganda’s ownership of its poverty reduction and public expenditure program
and collaboration among tocal and external partners—with Bank support
through the PRSC focused on policy and institutional reform measures with the
highest poverty impact in those areas where the Bank has a comparative
advantage. In addition, the approach helps reduce transaction costs in delivery
of external assistance, strengthen budgetary institutions, and align external
support for service delivery reforms with Uganda’s budget cycle, which is an
essential ingredient for sustained institutional reform and poverty reduction.

 

 

Thematic Perspectives 43with other sources of debt relief, their total outstanding debt 1s projected to fall by more than
two-thirds.

The year's considerable progress was enabled
by the intense efforts and dynamic cooperation of
HIPC governments, official creditors, and civil society from around the world The relief packages for
the 23 countries were developed with country authorities and approved by the Bank and IMF Boards of
Executive Directors in less than 16 months.

As a result of the enhanced HIPC Initiative
assistance, the annual public debt service burdens of
the 23 countries over the next three years will be cut
by roughly $1.1 billion, equal to 1 2 percent of GDP.
As a share of government revenues, debt service will
fall from 28 percent before HIPC relief to about 13
percent in 2001-02, freeing up resources for identified poverty reduction priorities, including social
sector expenditures. Debt service payments will be
reduced to about 2 percent of GDP, in comparison
with 7 percent of GDP that these countnes will be
spending on social investments.

Notwithstanding this progress, much work
remains to be done to ensure the long-term sustamabihty of HIPCs By delivering debt relief sufficient
to reduce a country’s level of debt in NPV terms to
either 150 percent of exports or 250 percent of government revenues at the decision point, the HIPC
Initiative provides a robust basis for long-term debt
sustainability. However, a permanent exit from debt
rescheduling can only be achieved if the underlying
causes that contributed to the debt problem are
addressed. Hence, debt sustainability depends not
only upon the absolute level of debt, but also upon
a comprehensive set of policies that lead to poverty
reduction and economic growth

REFORMING PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND
STRENGTHENING GOVERNANCE

Good governance and strong public institutions

are increasingly seen as critical for development
effectiveness. More and more, the focus of Bank
assistance 1s on helping countries to design and
implement good policies themselves A new strategy,
“Reforming Public Institutions and Strengthening
Governance,” was published in November 2000,
key new directions include emphasis on “bottom-up”
empowerment and longer-term Bank lending to
allow time for institutional reform

The World Bank Annual Report 2001

Among governance issues, public expenditure
management has emerged as a high-priority area.
Effective public spending is crucial for poverty
reduction, and strong public expenditure management systems are essential to ensure that development assistance 1s utilized as intended The Bank,
with partners, 1s working on an integrated approach
to improving the quality of expenditure management
In poor countries

Since 1997 anticorruption activities have been
increasingly integral and important components of
the Bank's public sector management portfolio,
which represented 12 percent of the Bank’s commitments in fiscal 2001 Increasingly, efforts are aimed
at not only assessing the quality of governance but
also offermg deeper insights into government performance and institutional arrangements.

PROMOTING GENDER EQUALITY

In fiscal 2001 the Bank published a major policy
research report, Engendermg Development—Through
Gender Equality m Rights, Resources, and Voice The
main findings of the report—which benefited from
extensive consultations with civil society, academia,
and donors—place gender at the center of the
Bank's work on poverty reduction. The report shows
that gender equality helps lower infant and child
mortality, improve nutrition, and lower fertility rates,
it 1s also associated with lower HIV/AIDS prevalence rates, less corruption in government, higher
economic productivity, and faster growth—outcomes
not traditionally linked to gender equality.

With strong empinical evidence that gender
inequalities tend to slow development, the Bank has
begun drafting a revised strategy for better integrating
gender into its assistance. Several regional consultations, including with chent governments, international agencies, and civil society, are helping to inform
this process Priorities are converging on chagnosing,
gender-related barriers, creating gender-inclusive
consultations, and working with country and external
partners to identify and support appropriate action.

HELPING COUNTRIES USE TRADE FOR
DEVELOPMENT

Trade plays an important role in growth—and therefore poverty reduction The Bank's three-pronged
approach compnises analysis of impediments totrade, advocacy of better trade policies that support
development, and advice to policymakers. In fiscal
2001 the Bank engaged in research and dissernination of studies demonstrating the crucial importance
of opening developed-country markets to goods from
developing countries. The Bank 1s also helping
developing countries use the multilateral trading
system more effectively through policy analysis,
training, and a handbook for trade negotiators A
new sourcebook of information on trade aims to
help chent countries prepare PRSPs. In addition,
twvo ongoing research programs, on general trade
policies and agriculture, provide assistance to countnes in identifying priorities for reforms at both the
national and multilateral levels

STRENGTHENING THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
ARCHITECTURE

The term “international financial architecture” refers
to the financial and institutional arrangements that
are critical to help countries avoid and mitigate
crises, integrate into the global economy, and develop successfully The Bank’s role in this area has
three dimensions ensuring that develop»ng country
perspectives are brought to bear on discussions on
international norms and governance, helping developing countries integrate into the international

economic and financial system, and diagnosing the
social and structural obstacles to successful development as a basis for Bank assistance

The Bank has been working closely with the
IMF on imtratives that will help developing countries
benefit from the global economy The Financial
Sector Assessment Program identifies financial system strengths and vulnerabilities (page 57). Under
the Reports on the Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) Program, the Bank prepares assessments in its traditional areas of expertise, ROSCs
summarize the extent to which countries observe certain internationally recognized standards that can
help improve economic policymaking and strengthen
the international financial system In fiscal 2001 146
ROSC assessments were completed, 94 of which
were published. The Bank has also collaborated with
the [MF and other partner organizations to develop a
set of principles and guidelines for effective insolvency and creditor rights systems In fiscal 2001 the
Board and the Development Committee agreed that
the Bank would, with partners, carry out a series of
experimental country insolvency assessments under
the ROSC Program A third area of collaboration
relates to preparation of studies on external debt
management that will help construct a set of core
principles for sovereign debt management

Investing in People

Two million children die every year from vaccinepreventable diseases. About three million people lost
their lives in the year 2000 from HIV/AIDS Many
people hing in poverty lack basic health and education, are vulnerable to crises, and have little personal
income or savings The world’s human development
needs are staggering.

The World Bank remains the largest external financier of human development programs It recogmies that healthy and educated people are the backbone of sustamable economic growth and central to
any strategy for achieving the international development goals. Through lending and nonlending services, it helps countries invest in and provide social
safety nets for their people—efforts that help allevate some of the worst consequences of poverty while
mcreasing people’s chances to improve their own
well-being In fiscal 2001 new lending commitments
for education, health, and social protection amounted to $4 4 bilhon (figure 3 1) Nonlending services
tanged from analytical work and sharing of best practice to support for preparation of people-focused
poverty reduction strategies and considerable work at
the global level, with multiple partners, to intensify
the fight against communicable diseases in particular.

The Bank also helped chents better integrate
human development concerns into overall poverty
reduction efforts in fiscal 2001. The first Poverty
Reduction Support Credit provided Uganda interestfree, medium-term multisector support for delivery
of basic education, health care, and water and sani

Children’s attendance at underperforming rural public schools in
Bangladesh has improved dramatically after government efforts to
involve nongovernmental organizations in the schools’ day-to-day
operation and maintenance The government is especially emphasizing
girls’ education, with support from the Bank

tation services, combined with broad public sector
reform (see page 43). In addition, education projects
addressing health, nutnition, and child labor issues
demonstrate efforts to take advantage of synergies
across social sectors (box 3 3).

THE EDUCATION AGENDA: FOCUSING ON ACCESS,
QUALITY, AND GENDER CONCERNS

Education empowers people, enhances opportunities
for greater participation in the labor market, and
promotes security. The Bank's education strategy
focuses on efforts proven to make a difference in
increasing access to schooling and improving the
quality of education. The Bank has also committed
to building human capacity for the knowledge
economy A key thrust 1s to help countries eliminate
gender disparities in primary and secondary education by 2005

At $1 1 billion, Bank lending for education in
fiscal 2001 was 1.5 tumes its fiscal 2000 level. The
increase reflects the Bank’s commitment—together
with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, Umted Nations Development
Programme, United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF), and United Nations Population Fund—
to scale up its support to countries’ education systems, following the April 2000 World Conference
on Education for All (EFA). New projects supported
improved access, quality, efficiency, and equity atBox 3.3 Focusing Resources on Effective School Health
(FRESH)

Education for All. (EFA) is about getting all children into school
and keeping them there. Poor and disadvantaged children are
the ones whose participation is most compromised, by ill health
and malnutrition. FRESH is a multicountry, multipartner program
launched at the April 2000 World Conference on EFA, aimed at
forging cross-sectoral linkages between education and health
sectors. There are now 22 projects in the Africa region that
include a school health and nutrition component using the
FRESH framework. Conceived as an effective program to respond
to a need, it is beginning to increase the efficacy of other investments in child development, promote better educational outcomes, and achieve greater social equity, while also being cost
effective. Highlights of FRESH follow:

@ It helps countries develop the school health components of
social sector projects, emphasizing health-related school policies, provision of safe water and sanitation, skills-based health
education, and school-based health and nutrition services.

@ It allows an international exchange of information on school
health and aims at a common vision of school health among

 

development agencies.
i It serves to accelerate implementation of HIV/AIDS- and
malaria-prevention activities in the education sector.

 

the primary, secondary, and vocational levels; an area
of focus was distance learning. As of June 30, 2001,
the Bank had 64 active education projects that
address girls’ education. For example, innovative

and effective programs are being implemented in
Bangladesh to benefit secondary school girls, and in
India to benefit primary school children. Results are
improving: under a project in Guinea, for example,
girls’ enrollment increased moderately to 49 percent
in 2000-01 from 44 percent a year earlier. The Bank
is also helping improve adult—especially female—
literacy in several countries.

The Bank also provides varied nonlending support for education. In fiscal 2001 such efforts included analytical work, synthesis of good practice, and
capacity building, as well as technical support to help
countries prepare Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers.
Major policy issues identified to be in early need of
attention were education finance, teacher training
and pay, and coverage (to widen access). Strategic
alliances constitute another important form of support. In fiscal 2001 the Bank worked with donor,
nongovernmental organization (NGO), and private
sector partners to support the Focusing Resources on
Effective School Health (FRESH) program in Africa
(box 3.3), and with the private sector in particular to

help countries address digital divide and information
communications technology issues. Collaboration
with the private sector will further benefit from the
IFC's new education strategy, which sees these players as partners in helping alleviate financial constraints, enhance social mobility, improve equity,
encourage innovation, and promote effectiveness.

EXPANDING EFFORTS TOWARD A HEALTHY
GLOBAL POPULATION

In fiscal 2001 Bank lending to help countries
improve health outcomes and health systems performance, and to promote sustainable financing of
health care, amounted to $1.3 billion. Significant
support was directed toward combating the
HIV/AIDS epidemic and other communicable diseases, the former evolving rapidly from a health issue
into a formidable development challenge for many
countries, especially in Africa (see also pages 27, 67,
and 103). The Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for
Africa and a similar multicountry program for the
Caribbean earmarked $500 million and $155 million,
respectively, for HIV/AIDS projects that support the
scaling up of national prevention and care programs.
Total Bank support for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care in stand-alone projects, as well as
components in other projects, amounted to $393.6
million in fiscal 2001, and to $851.5 million over the
last five years (see footnote e to table 1.1 on page 26).
The Bank has also accelerated its efforts to combat
malaria and tuberculosis, diseases that are preventable but which are leading killers of poor people.
The Bank also continued to help countries
improve nutrition and reproductive health outcomes.
Efforts to support nutrition focused on its links to
poverty, its impact on learning and productivity, and
women’s nutrition. The Bank's work in reproductive
health emphasized the impoverishing effects of
unplanned pregnancy, maternal mortality and morbidity, and sexually transmitted diseases. Operational
tools, such as practice guides on condom procurement and contracting for delivery of reproductive
health services, are helping to improve outcomes. And
to arrest the growing health burden posed by noncommunicable diseases, the Bank’s work on the economics of tobacco control is helping to demonstrate
that taxation, together with nonprice measures (for
instance, advertising bans), can reduce smoking and
save lives without negatively affecting the economy.

Thematic Perspectives 47Box 3.4 Multidimensional Support for Social Protection

Lending for social protection has grown over the past several years, espe
cially in fiscal 1999 in response to the Asian crisis. Bank support for this

aspect of human development encompasses a wide range of activities:
Providing training, with the World Bank Institute and to participants
worldwide, on how labor market policies and social safety nets can be
designed and implemented to reduce poverty and mitigate the risks
facing the poor.
Working with the International Labour Organisation and UNICEF to
improve child labor data and assess the impact of anti-child labor
efforts, and with IFC in its assistance to private sector clients in helping end child labor.
Bringing pension reform tools to Argentina to broaden support of the
elderly, to India to devise coverage for the informal sector, and to
Senegal to reduce fiscal costs and free up resources for other urgent
needs.
Building on the experience of social funds to give communities greater
control over the decisions and resources that affect their lives, including emergency responses to natural disasters in Madagascar and
Cambodia this year.
Through a pilot social risk and vulnerability assessment in the Latin
America and Caribbean region, identifying two extremely vulnerable
groups generally unprotected by existing programs: children 0 to 5
years old facing serious health and developmental risks, and youth
aged 15 to 24 years old, who are susceptible to dropping out of
school, unemployment, violence, and crime.

PROTECTING THE MOST VULNERABLE

Natural or manmade shocks can devastate poor famihes, robbing them of security, income, and productivity Social protection—risk reduction and mitigation,
and coping—measures are essential to making the
poor less vulnerable. Such measures seek to help
individuals, households, and communities better
manage risks, and to provide support to the critically
poor In fiscal 2001 these measures helped countries
build able pension systems, develop equitable and
mclusive labor markets, eliminate child labor, and
rely on social safety nets and social funds to reach
vulnerable groups (box 3 4). Lending for social protection continued to grow in fiscal 2001, amounting
to $1 9 bilhon, compared with $1 5 billion last year.

A Bolivian child is immunized Through policy dialogue, lending
operations, and partnerships such as the Global Alliance for Vaccines

The Bank adopted a new Social Protection
Strategy in September 2000, prepared following
extensive consultations with governments, donors,
United Nations agencies, NGOs, and civil society.
The strategy benefits from an analysis of vulnerability and proposes reliance on pilot social nsk and
vulnerability assessments as well as a methodology
for social expenditure reviews that would enhance the
coverage and impact of social protection programs.Promoting Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development

For the World Bank, promoting sustainable development means improving the linkages between poverty
alleviation and the environment It means enhancing
food security, the overall well-being of rural people,
and the sustainable use of natural resources. And it
means ensuring greater civic engagement, particularly by the most vulnerable groups in society

POVERTY AND THE ENVIRONMENT —
IMPROVING THE LINKAGE

Environmental degradation poses great harm to
developing countries, which suffer annual losses of
productivity and natural capital as high as 4 to 8
percent of GDP Over the past year, the Bank's
environmental work has been informed by global
consultations with institutions, governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), civil soctety,
and the private sector, through in-country workshops
as well as electronic and Web-based discussions.
With country and external partners, the Bank seeks
to help improve the
Quality of Iife—by reducing environmental
health nsks and vulnerability to environmental
hazards
Quality of growth—by promoting sustainable
management of resources, such as forests, land,
and water, as an essential condition for long-term
and lasting improvements in people's well-being
| Quality of the global environmental commons—
by pursuing efforts targeted to benefit developing
countries and local communities

The Bank 1s exploring how environmental work
can be better designed to improve health outcomes.
Analysis in fiscal 2001 with India’s Andhra Pradesh
state, in collaboration with the World Health
Organisation and donors, examined the effects of
poor household environments and lack of basic infrastructure on public health The analysis influenced
the state's priorities mn sector planning At a regional
level, “Cleaner Transport Fuels for Central Asia and
the Caucasus,” a two-year study, resulted in a commitment by authorities to improve fuel quality, monttor vehicle emissions, and establish new regulations

countries for the sustainable development of Nile
waters (see page 93).

The Bank ts also working actively at the global
level, with multiple partners, recognizing that a large
number of environmental concerns cannot be
addressed purely at the country level (see page 103
for examples of partnerships in the environment area,
and page 21 for a description of the Prototype

Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the
Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol, the
Bank continues to work with the United Nations

SUSTAINING LIFE

About 1.2 billion people live on less than $1 a day,
and 800 million people go to bed hungry every
night, most of them live in rural areas. Slowing and
reversing the decline in the natural resource base
and improving the productivity of agriculture are
imperatives for Bank assistance

The Bank is basing its rural work over the past
year on three pillars—enhancing the social and economic well-being of rural people, improving food
security, and ensuring the sustamable use of natural
resources Supplementing the rural work is the
Bank's attention to the forestry sector, aiming to harness the potential of forests to reduce poverty, ntegrate forests in sustainable economic development,
and protect global forest values. The Bank 1s
involved in partnerships and special initiatives, such
as the World Bank-World Wide Fund for Nature
Alhance for Forest Conservation and Sustainable
Use, in which the Bank has invested close to
$2 million. The Alliance aims at three targets by 2005
50 millon hectares of new forest protected areas, a
comparable area of existing but highly threatened
forest protected areas secured under effective
management, and a global target of 200 million
hectares of production forest under ndependently
certified sustamable management The Chief
Executive Officer Forum on Forest Industry and
Conservation—chaired by Mr. Wolfensohn—is a
private sector—civil society dialogue process with
ambitious objectives for improved forest management and forest conservation

In fiscal 2001 the Bank actively supported efforts
to sustain life in rural areas A financial systems support project will increase access to microcredit in
poor rural areas in Romania, for example, while support for farmed marshlands, commercial and export
agnculture, and agricultural services delivery will help
Rwanda on its road to recovery Total lending for
rural development rose to $2 2 billion in fiscal 2001,
compared with $2 1 billion in fiscal 2000

Efforts at a global level are aimed at scaling up
development impact. In fiscal 2001 the Bank

The World Bank Annual Report 2001

approved a grant to be used through the Global
Mechanism of the Convention to Combat
Desertification, which will help member countries
combat desertification and mitigate the effects of
drought by engaging civil society and the pnivate sector. Through the GEF, the Bank 1s also coordinating
the Africa Land and Water Initiative Action Program
to reverse the rapid trends of land and water degradation in Africa through comprehensive approaches

The Bank 1s also contributmg to efforts to double
global food production to feed an additional 2 9 bilhon people by 2050 With the growing scarcity of
land and water, future increases in food supplies have
to come from increased productivity (rather than
expanded cultivation and irrigation). Supported by 58
public and private sector members, including the
Bank, the 16 international research centers that make
up the Consultative Group on International Agnicultural Research (CGIAR) are at the forefront of mobihzing modern agricultural science on behalf of the
world's poor and hungry (see page 103) CGIAR technologies support the Bank's rural lending programs to
allevate hunger and poverty, improve rural productivity and raise agncultural incomes, manage natural
resources sustainably, and build partnerships with
national agricultural research programs. In fiscal 2001
the CGIAR launched a fast-track, participatory
reform process toward a revitalized, world-class
knowledge network—an agile South-North partnership that works at the frontier of science for the poor
and provides public goods research

DEALING WITH THE SOCIAL DIMENSIONS
OF POVERTY

Sustainable development also requires addressing
the social dimensions of poverty—that poor people
must have more say and participate as equal partners The Bank 1s working to improve the quality of
such operations and is developing a methodology for
including social dimensions 1n programmatic lending A review in fiscal 2001 found that good social
assessments are helping promote social inclusion,
participation, and ownership in Bank operations.
Helping countries affected by conflict—
frequently in partnership with other agencies—is a
fast-growing pniority for the Bank. People affected by
confhct are among the most vulnerable to poverty
and 1ll health, including HIV/AIDS. Conflict and
violence remain among the most pressing social andeconomic problems in several parts of the world:
16 of the world’s 20 poorest countries are in—or are
just emerging from—conflict, and some 35 others
may currently be considered affected by confhct
Reconstructing societies after conflict 1s as much, if
not more, about helpmg people rebuild their hives
and meet their social and political security needs as
it is about repairing physical infrastructure Given its
overall mandate, the Bank hopes to contribute to
conflict prevention in two ways. by providing assistance that may help countries become more resilient
to eruption of violent conflict, for stance through
strengthened capacity to address root causes and
trigger issues, and by strengthening its own and
partners’ sensitivities to the potential positive and
negative impacts of conflicts on development policies and programs. The Bank provides substantial
lending and nonlending support to countries emerging from conflict, particularly in Africa, ranging from
comprehensive reconstruction packages to small
grants from the Post-Conflict Fund Examples
include a program to help Entrean excombatants
demobilize and re-integrate into normal hfe, and
another to promote the transition from conflict to
peace in Mindanao, in the Philippines

The Bank's new operational policy, “Development
Cooperation and Conflict,” guides its work in countries affected by conflict The Post-Conflict Fund
has, since 1997, provided financing for early phases
of Bank work in post-conflict situations, with $29
million in grants allocated to more than 30 countres. Over the past year, and with increased bilateral
donor financing, this fund has supported projects in
East Timor, Eritrea, and Georgia

Cultural identity 1s another essential part of
empowering communities to take charge of their
own destinies. The Bank continues to promote, currently through over 80 stand-alone or component
operations, efforts that recognize the role of culture

SHARPENING THE TOOLS FOR SUCCESS

Strengthening the safeguard system. The Bank's
environmental and social safeguard policies are
designed to prevent and mitigate undue harm, to
people and their environments, that may potentially
result from Bank operations. In fiscal 2001 the Bank
restated its operational policies to ensure greater clar

support for CDD, an approach explicitly identifying a role for
communities, society groups, and local people in development
efforts. Support for CDD 1s significant and growing: new commitments amounted to roughly $1 4 billion tn fiscal 2001,

The Bank intensified support to all regions for CDD in fiscal 2001. It has undertaken a major effort in 17 African countries to increase funding of community groups and elected
local governments to enable their greater participation in policy and institutional reform. Similar efforts are ongoing in East

Europe (Albania, Armenia, Romania), and Central Asta. In South
Asia and Latin America, the CDD portfolio continues to expand.

regional safeguard coordinators, established a safeguards “helpdesk” for staff, and upgraded the safeguards training program.

Participation and civic engagement. The Bank
increasingly recognizes that inclusive, participatory
development 1s key to more equitable and sustainable development Over the past year, it sponsored
events on civic engagement and participatory
approaches, with participants representing governments and NGOs in about 40 countnes Civic
engagement 1s a vital underpinning of the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper Program and also central
to the Community-Driven Development (CDD)
approach, which is about transferring funds to community groups so that they can invest in their own
development priorities, as well as ensuring poor people’s access to information to enable them to make
informed investment decisions and engage 1n entrepreneurial activities (box 3.5)

Science and technology (S&T). Dealing effectively
with urgent global 1issues—communicable diseases,
environmental degradation, or food security—
requires increased scientific and technological
capacity The Bank is looking to S&T to help provide

Supporting Private Sector Development and Infrastructure

 

Private markets are crucial for economic growth But

well-functioning private markets do not always develop spontaneously, they depend on sound institutional
and policy environments. Growth, while the best way
out of poverty, 1s not always enough for all to escape
it Efforts are needed to ensure effective social safety
nets. Responding to these dual considerations, the
World Bank's private sector development effort aims
to help countries strengthen their investment chimates and improve the delivery of infrastructure services to poor people New lending to support private
sector development and infrastructure amounted to
$5.6 bilhion, with the active portfolio at $47 3 billion
as of June 30, 2001 (figures 3 2 and 3 3).

faster (box 3 6) Moreover, foreign direct investment
flows to developing countries continue to substantially exceed official aid flows (figure 3 4), although,
particularly since the Asian crisis, these flows have
been concentrated in a few middle-income and
large countries To help more countries attract private investment, the Bank 1s developing systematic
methodologies to identify investment barriers and
monitor progress on corrective efforts

In fiscal 2001 the joint Bank-IFC Foreign
Investment Advisory Service continued its foreign
direct investment surveys in places as diverse as
East Timor, Nigeria, and the Russian Federation.
Such surveys—showing, for example, that theabsence of land markets, an intrusive tax regime,
and excessive foreign currency and customs regulations are impeding foreign investment in the Russian
Federation—are helping authorities develop correclve strategies.

The Bank is also strengthening its support for
small and medium enterprise (SME) development
A joint Bank-IFC SME department formed in fiscal
2000 1s blending the Bank’s business-climate policy
expertise with the [FC’s transaction and companylevel experience. In Bosmia and Herzegovina, for
example, IFC's links with local business have fostered policy dialogue between firms and government

Joint Bank-IFG work 1s promoting the investment
chmate for mining in low-income countries while
encouraging environmental and social initiatives. A
fiscal 2001 project in Mozambique, for example, will
not only catalyze private investment but also promote
private provision of infrastructure, HIV education,
and SME support services to local communities. The
Bank 1s also helping build Mozambique’s mining institutions, while improving the efficiency, capacity,
employment, and environmental impact of the mining
sectors of Poland and Ukraine

SUPPORT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE:
STRENGTHENING PRIVATE PARTICIPATION,
SERVICES FOR THE POOR

Infrastructure has multiple links to poverty reduction Improved infrastructure can help create jobs
and raise worker productivity It can save time and
human effort in transporting water, crops, wood, and
other commodities It can also improve health (by
reducing indoor air pollution and emissions in urban
areas and making clean water available) and education (by expanding access to schools, computers,
and lighting)

The Bank provides advice, finance, risk mitigation, and knowledge and information services to
help countries improve their infrastructure A major
objective relates to the design of sound legal and
regulatory frameworks to promote private participation. While lending support (typically to mddleincome countries) tapers off as they gain increased
access to private fiance, it will continue to be
important—together with technical assistance for
sector reform—1in countries where such access
remains limited. Subsector highlights for the year
are noted below.

Research shows that the top developing country performers in
terms of expanded foreign trade and investment (a group including India, China, and Mexico) enjoyed good growth in the 1990s,
while the rest of the developing world, as a whole, did poorly.

The result was partly an outcome of trade liberalization, but also
depended on factors such as the rule of law and corruption, infrastructure investment, and streamlining of government regulations.

Re-engineering

Redirecting the mission of a central bank, reconnecting it to economic goals, and refocusing core functions is an enormous
effort—one that requires the commitment and courage demonstrated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). Following extensive discussions over the course of 2000, CBSL staff determined
that the bank needed to realign its role within the Sri Lankan
economy and better position itself to support the nation’s economic development.

Taking its cue from severai forward-thinking central banks,
CBSL has decided to shed ancillary functions such as public debt
management, management of the Employees Provident Fund,
and development financing activities. CBSL staff have refocused
the bank's objectives on price stability and financial sector stability. Management is in the process of restructuring CBSL,
automating business activities, and implementing a Voluntary
Retirement Scheme—which will result in a 50 percent reduction
in staff. CBSL is also committed to dramatic changes in human
resource policies, moving away from time-in-grade criteria for
staff promotion to a merit-based system.

In June 2001, the World Bank approved a $30.3 miltion
credit to support this completely “homegrown” modet of institutional reform. Success over the long term is very likely because
the program was designed by the central bankers themselves.

helped the Central Bank of West African States to
put in place a set of regional payment mechanisms,
and supported Brazil's efforts to accelerate and consolidate financial sector reform—and thereby prevent
financial crises, which hit the poor hardest. These
loans are representative of the Bank's efforts to help
governments reduce the risks to consumers of using
financial services; minimize the cost of resolving bad
banks (thus enabling other government spending);
and strengthen financial system infrastructures, without which growth could not take place.

Nonlending services. A core diagnostic process
underlying activities in many countries is the joint
World Bank-IMF Financial Sector Assessment
Program. Joint missions of financial sector specialists
help national authorities diagnose vulnerabilities and
priorities in their financial sectors and assess observance of select international supervisory and regulatory standards and codes. The IMF's focus on the
linkages between the financial sector and macroeconomic performance is complemented by the Bank's
emphasis on economic development and capacity
building. Twenty-three country assessments were

 

undertaken in fiscal 2001, bringing the total to 35
assessments since program inception in May 1999.
Follow-up to these assessments, in terms of technical
assistance, has already taken place in more than a
dozen countries. Another 24 to 30 countries are
expected to participate in the program in fiscal 2002.

Technical assistance. Technical assistance has
been an important tool for the Bank in helping governments carry out financial system reform. Advice
continued to Indonesia to target pressure points for
revitalizing economic growth: corporate governance
of state banks, debt management, and corporate
debt restructuring. In Ukraine, the Bank helped the
government clearly define the methods and procedures for the resolution of one of the largest banks
in the country, Banka Ukraina. Efforts to deepen
and scale up microfinance services in Bangladesh
will increase access to finance by up to 1.5 million
new microcredit borrowers and will help skilled
microcredit entrepreneurs move to higher levels of
activities through loans of up to $1,000. By directly
targeting women and the poorest segments of the
population in rural and urban areas, this project will
directly reduce poverty.

SUPPORT AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL

At the global level, the Bank has worked to strengthen the international financial architecture by promoting international standards that respond to the
requirements of developing countries, by developing
tools to help governments maintain the stability of
financial systems, and by offering training programs
to build the capacity of supervisory and regulatory
agencies. Besides the IMF, with whom coordination
on financial sector work has increased significantly in
the past few years, partners in these efforts include
the Financial Stability Forum, Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision, International Organization of
Securities Commissions, and International
Association of Insurance Supervisors. The Bank
brings its unique perspective to global standardsetting bodies, based on its experience in the field
and understanding of the difficulties in implementing
financial standards in a developing-country context.
For example, the lessons learned from implementing
payment system standards in Latin America’s
Western Hemisphere Clearance and Settlement
Initiative were valuable in guiding the assessment

Sustained Reform Pays Off

In the early 1990s Cape Verde’s financial sector was underdeveloped: banks were unprofitable and carried bad loans, the
payments system was nonfunctional, and a weak legal and
regulatory environment stifled growth. The financial condition
of the country’s largest bank, the state-owned Banco
Comercial do Atlantico (BCA), was deteriorating, and the government had to act. Given the bank’s 90 percent market share
and high liquidation costs, the Wortd Bank recommended that
the government restructure BCA instead.

With support from the World Bank, the government of
Cape Verde embarked on an ambitious economic reform program in 1996. A number of profound changes were introduced.

Fighting poverty for lasting results 1s the World
Bank’s mission Effective and equitable legal systems
are vital to eradicating poverty—and sustaining
gains. The Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s
demonstrated not only that a sound financial architecture 1s essentual for growth but also that an

effective legal and judicial system 1s paramount for
growth to be equitable and sustainable The transition in Eastern Europe has shown that market forces
alone, without transparent laws and fair enforcement, can lead to uneven economic growth and
increased poverty Poor people often lack legal mghts
that would empower them to take advantage of
opportunities and protect them from arbitrary and
inequitable treatment. They, more than any other
group in society, are adversely affected by laws permitting discrimination, deficient laws and institutions that fail to protect individual and property
nghts, and insufficient enforcement of these laws, as
well as other barriers to Justice.

legal aid for poor women in Ecuador. While the
majority of legal and judicial reform projects have an
indirect impact on poor people, innovative components are often included in projects to reach the
most vulnerable members of society In poorer countnes, the Bank supports efforts to bring justice close
to the poor both physically and culturally by enhancing effective traditional informal mechanisms—while
at the same time building a compatible formal system, and changing inherent traditional biases that
may hurt the poor. In its work with middle-income
countries, the Bank concentrates its efforts on modernizing the legal framework and strengthening the
judicial system to promote economic development
and social inclusion.

The broad objectives of assistance are to help
bring about legal and judicial reform, improve governance and physical infrastructure, and increase
access to justice Key elements of reform include
promoting judicial independence through improved
appointment systems, planning, and financing, as
well as disciplinary procedures, modernizing judicial
administration and case management, and training
Judges and court personnel Governance improvements encompass strengthening anticorruption programs, building capacity in pubhe agencies and civil
society organizations, and supporting bar associations and legal education Bank assistance may
include improvements in physical infrastructure,
such as providing public formation areas in courthouses and setting design standards for court buildings to improve physical access for the public, as
well as to increase efficiency Access to Justice can
be enhanced by providing legal counseling and advocacy, particularly for the vulnerable, and by developing alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and
modernizing court admimstration

Working closely with governments, bar associations, judges, and civil society, the Bank 1s embarking on a number of activities in support of Jaw and
justice (figure 3 5). These diverse activities mclude
the sharing of global and regional knowledge on

Box 3.10 Support for Bangladesh's Business Climate,
Women, and Poor People

Approved in fiscal 2001, the Bangladesh Legal and judicial Capacity
Building Project 1s aimed at (1) improving the business environment
by making the civil justice System more supportive of economic
activity, and (2) improving access to justice for women and poor people. The project combines traditional etements of judicial reform with
innovative measures to increase access to justice and fight corruption. It also promotes women’s representation on the bench, gendersensitivity training for judges and court personnel, legal aid for poor
women, and informal dispute resolution mechanisms to bring justice
to the underprivileged.

The project's capacity-building component will help improve
court administration and case management systems, upgrade court
infrastructure, strengthen small claims courts, provide training, and
upgrade traning facilities Legal literacy and public awareness campaigns would be carried out in cooperation with local nongovernmental organizations.

The proyect—which was built on extensive consultations with
civil soctety, legal professionals, and government officials ~ was
funded by an IDA credit ($30 6 million, total project cost $43 7 mittion), with cofinancing by the Danish International Development

Administration and the Canadian International Development Agency.

jurists and legal scholars, to provide guidance to the
Bank on its law- and justice-related activities

Assessing countries’ legal and judicial systems.
Through intensive, comprehensive diagnostic assessments, the Bank has been building its knowledge of
the significant elements of countries’ legal systems.
Legal and judicial sector assessments are the basis for
dialogue with governments and for the design and
implementation of programs, in concert with other
development partners In fiscal 2001 the Bank undertook assessments for Argentina, Romania, the Russian
Federation, the Slovak Republic, and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia Such assessments review
appointment and disciplinary procedures of yudges and
provide baseline information on each system's efficiency and effectiveness Results from some of the
assessments show that key areas in need of further indepth analysis are access to justice, alternative dispute
resolution mechanisms, gender protection, the cost of
inefficient systems, and corruption.

The World Bank Annual Report 2001

LENDING FOR REFORM

To date there are 31 stand-alone projects in legal
and judicial reform, there are more than 10 times
that number of components in Bank-financed pro)ects that deal with some aspect of legal and judicial
reform New lending for legal and judicial reform
amounted to $47 million for fiscal 2001—with
another $51 5 million in preparation—and concentrated on deepening reforms in some of the world’s
poorest countnies. Activities included. a comprehensive program for legal and judicial reform in
Bangladesh (see box 3.10) as well as similar programs in preparation for Benin, Guinea, the
Philippines, and Sierra Leone The first full-scale
evaluation of a judicial reform project was completed for Bolivia, allowing the Bank to draw the first
lessons for other legal and judicial work in Latin
Amenica. The evaluation underscored the long-term
nature of legal and judicial reform and the need for
not only realistic expectations and goals but also
unflinching commitment by the government and

all stakeholders.

A survey of recent Bank activities in knowledge,
capacity building, and law reform in 84 countries
shows that the Africa Region had the hnghest percentage (52 percent) of capacity-building activities in legal
and judicial reform (figure 3 5) Capacity- and institution-building aspects of the legal and judicial reform
activities supported by the Bank aim at strengthening
the judiciary, strengthening legal institutions, and
increasing access to justice Included in these actities was a series of workshops held to support the harmonuzation of commercial codes in 16 (francophone
and lusophone) African countries under the
Organisation pour l'Harmonisation en Afrique du
Droit des Affaires Treaty, as well as the strengthening
of the women lawyers’ association in Niger to increase
its capacity to deliver legal services to the rural and
urban poor Forty-nine percent of the activities in the
South Asia Region were law reform activities, the
Europe and Central Asia Region was close behind
with 38 percent. These activities included reviewing
land tithng in Sri Lanka, as well as providing technical assistance on insolvency, enterprise restructuring,
and institutional and regulatory reforms in the Czech
Republic The East Asia Region had the largest number of knowledge activities, including a legal needs

HIV/AIDS: Prevention Is Vital

Today 36 million people are infected
with HIV; more than 21 million have died
of AIDS since the 1980s; and over 13
miltion children have been orphaned by
the disease.

As a cosponsor of the Joint United
Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS), the World Bank has committed more resources to HIV/AIDS in fiscal
2001 than in any previous year. Other
sections of this Annual Report discuss
the Bank’s support to Africa (page 27 )
and work with partners (page 103).

In this chapter, the “Fast Facts” box in
each section shows the number of persons living with HIV/AIDS.* While the
epidemic’s impact on Sub-Saharan Africa
has been by far the gravest, data for
South Asia—a region with relatively low
HIV prevalence rates but extensive vulnerability to the infection—underscore
that both rates and absolute numbers
matter. South Asia’s large population, for
example, means that a rise of a mere 0.1
percent in the overall adult prevalence
rate would increase the region’s total of
adults living with HIV by about half a
million persons,

Prevention is vital. And it is estimated that, while a national prevention
program in Sub-Saharan Africa would
cost less than $3 per capita with prevalence rates below 5 percent, costs would
quadruple to $12 per capita at prevalence rates of 15 percent. UNAIDS estimates that a basic HIV/AIDS program in
all developing countries would cost at
least $9.2 billion per year, six times the
current level of investment.

* Figures presented in the "Fast Facts” boxes in
this chapter represent UNAIDS estimates as of
December 2000 and are based on UNAIDS
regional definitions, which differ somewhat from
those used by the World Bank For more details,

REGIONAL CONTEXT: URGENT NEED FOR FASTER,
REGIONWIDE DEVELOPMENT

Economic growth in Africa in 2000 was mixed. While
it averaged 7 percent in Mozambique and Uganda
and 5 percent in 14 other countnes, Sub-Saharan
Africa's economic performance has, on average, weakened over the last two years, largely due to resurgent
conflicts and political upheavals in a few countries. In
addition, sharply higher oil prices in 2000 created
adverse external shocks for some countries, while
markets for other primary exports were depressed.

For much of the region, inequality is still high
and growth remains below the 5 percent rate needed
to prevent an increase in the number of poor Many
still have no access to basic services and cannot
effectively participate in the modern economy.
HIV/AIDS remains one of the largest challenges to
human development in Afnca, having already
reversed hard-won gains in life expectancy in several
countries. Africa has also experienced falling levels
of overseas development assistance, down to $19 per
capita by 1998 from $32 in 1990.

These factors have sharpened the urgency for
accelerated development in Afnca. At the 2000
World Bank-IMF Annual Meetings in Prague, Bank
President James D. Wolfensohn and IMF Managing
Director Horst Kohler committed to making Africa a
priority. In February 2001 they met with 22 African
heads of state in Bamako, Mali, and Dar Es Salaam,
Tanzania, to listen to their visions of how Africa can
accelerate growth rates, drastically reduce poverty,
and position itself to benefit from globalization. The
leaders recognized that poverty reduction had to
begin with peace, democracy, and good governance.
And they acknowledged that prospects for higher

“Today in Africa, we are aware that it’s not the
Bank or the Fund that is gong to develop our
countries or fight against poverty. It's up to us.
We shall do it. We need to be accompanied by
these institutions because they have the know
how that helps us to amplify, multiply, and

accelerate what we are going to do.”

Spring 2001 Meetings of the World Bank and IMF.

Supporting poverty reduction through debt relief

‘ A total of 13 African countries qualified in fiscal 2001

to receive debt rehef under the enhanced Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative For these

oaepoenaheanns a el countries, debt service will be reduced over time,

important prionty for many African countries from all creditors, by about two-thirds, or over $25
bilhon. Particularly in Africa such debt relief reflects
the coming together of a global and diverse group of
partners The Bank helped achieve consensus on debt
reduction without jeopardizing positive aid transfers.

66 The World Bank Annual Report 2001IDA-eligible African countries became eligible
for debt relief by preparing Poverty Reduction
Strategy Papers (PRSPs), which bring aid agencies
and countries together around common goals
defined by the country. Through the PRSP process,
17 African countnes began to pursue a countrydriven development agenda, underpinned by a
process of domestic consensus building and with
support from development partners. Such support 1s
provided by the IMF's Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility and the Bank’s Poverty Reduction
Support Credht, the first of which was approved for
Uganda in fiscal 2001 (see page 43)

Tackling the HIV/AIDS epidemic and other
communicable diseases

Investing in people—and addressing HIV/AIDS in
particular—has been a key prionity for the Bank,
working closely with UNAIDS and other partners
(see page 103). In September 2000, through a MultiCountry HIV/AIDS Program for Afnca, the Bank
made a regionwide commitment to put all the necessary resources at the disposal of African countries
struck by the pandemic (see page 27). The Bank earmarked an initial $500 million in flexible and rapid
IDA funding for individual HIV/AIDS projects developed by Sub-Saharan African countries, of which

Spurring private sector development

A buoyant private sector—both domestic and
foreign—is critical for sustained growth and generation of jobs and domestic income The Bank continued supporting reforms aimed at improving the
environment for business and investment It also
developed new tools to support the development of
trade, such as the seven-country Regional Trade
Facilitation Project (box 4 2). In response to African
leaders’ requests, the Bank increased its lending for
infrastructure operations (transport, energy, water)—
both to facilitate the development of the private sector and to improve living standards The Bank
committed to further increase its lending in the
infrastructure sectors in the coming years.

Regional Perspectives 6768

Helping empower communities

To ensure that development benefits do reach the
poorest communities, the Bank developed Community
Action Programs, which reflect the CommunityDriven Development (CDD) approach that empowers
communuties by making resources available to them in
support of effective local development programs The
Bank has placed growing emphasis on decentralized
CDD mechanisms to help channel resources to rural
areas, such as the social funds in Malawi and nutrition
programs in Senegal and Madagascar. This effort was
complemented by a focus on strengthening capacities,
in both the public and private sectors. The Bank has
committed up to $150 million to the Partnership for
Capacity Building in Africa (PACT) over five years,
together with the Harare-based African Capacity
Building Foundation. In 2000 PACT funded projects
in 29 countries to help develop skills, knowledge, and
management capacity.

Helping countries affected by conflict

Conflict is increasingly becoming a development
issue in Africa. The Bank has strengthened its
capacity to cooperate with specialized partners,
including United Nations agencies, bilaterals, and
NGOs, in preventing conflict and supporting postconflict recovery. With regard to prevention, the
Bank has worked with others to try to address some
of the root causes that may generate political instability and, eventually, conflict, and in particular
poverty and inequalities. With regard to recovery, the
Bank was active in several countries, both through
project financing and technical advice. In November
2000 the Bank approved a $90 million credit to support Eritrea’s long-term reconstruction and economic
recovery, through complementary actions in agriculture, private sector reconstruction, and social protection. The Bank also approved two credits totaling
$400.6 million to assist the Ethiopian government
with its post-war recovery program. Support
included the emergency demobilization and reintegration of 150,000 veterans of the conflict with
Eritrea, emergency humanitarian needs, and rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure, as well
as stabilization of the economy and restarting the
reform agenda. Other countries in which the Bank
has been active in post-conflict reconstruction operations include Burundi, Guinea-Bissau, Rwanda,
and Sierra Leone.

The World Bank Annual Report 2001

Box 4.1 Rolling Back Malaria

Malaria is on the rise again, killing over a million people a year
worldwide, including an estimated 700,000 children. And the
rising numbers of people affected by malaria are overwhelming
national health services and weakening societies, particularly in
Sub-Saharan Africa, where 90 percent of the cases occur.

In April 2001 the Bank hosted the Fourth Global
Partnership Meeting to Roll Back Malaria (RBM). Participants
shared experiences on expanding country-level partnerships to
implement national programs to reach the RBM goal of halving
the burden of malaria by 2010. They examined the roles of government, the private sector, and NGOs in working together to
extend malaria programs beyond the public health sector. They
also discussed the challenges faced in mobilizing and effectively
employing external resources, and the opportunities provided
through the PRSP and HIPC initiatives to scale up successful
malaria programs.

 

 

Box 4.2 Stimutating Africa’s Productivity by Facilitating
Regional Trade

Financing for productive activities in Africa is severely con
strained by a percoption that the region is highly risky. in many
countries, however, this perception is not justified by circumstances. The (DA-supported Regional Trade Facilitation Project
(RTFP, $110 million) tackles this problem by bringing together
countries that are willing to acidress the market's perception by
setting up a credible insurance mechanism against losses
caused by political risks, These ceurtrles’ governments would
be the ultimate risk takers in the Insurance mechanism, creating
a strong disincentive te cause claims, Private insurers, while not
currenily able to assume the high political risi in cross-border
transactions involving African countries, would with the public
sector's assumption of risk—be able to extend activities in the
region.

The RTFP will benefit commercial firms involved tn trade, by
extending the maturities at which credit is available and creating a more stable business environment. Seven countries will
initially benefit (Burundi, Kenya, Ma awl, Rwanda, Tanzania,
Uganda, and Zambia); the project could tater be extended to all
African countries.Table 4.1 World Bank Lending to Borrowers in Africa, by Sector, Fiscal 1992-2001

to encompass global good practices. In fiscal
2001, $2.1 bilhon in new lending, covering 30
projects (excluding 3 with special trust fund
financing), supplemented the Bank's policy
advice and technical support The strategic thrust
of Bank assistance includes revitalizing the business sector, supporting public sector performance, addressing social risks, and preventing
countries from retreating into environmental
neglect.

Delivering global and regional experience to
countries and applying resources to local needs
are the driving principles behind the Bank’s strategy in East Asia Nearly half the Bank’s staff in
the region and all its Country Directors are
located in the field to ensure more effective
assistance. Indonesia’s fiscal 2001 CAS, developed 1n a highly consultative manner, links

To promote regional competitiveness, the Bank is
investing in information infrastructure, technology
innovation, and skills development. Thailand's CDPC
is addressing key constraints in these areas, complemented by technical assistance from partners. The
Bank-managed Vietnam Development Information
Center is a multidonor-funded cutting-edge facility
that offers distance learning and public access to
global knowledge; the operation is one of four Global
Development Learning Network centers established
by the Bank in Asia. Through knowledge and country
development partnerships established with countries
such as the Republic of Korea and Thailand, the
Bank is facilitating access to global development
knowledge to reduce vulnerability and strengthen
competitiveness (box 4.4). Work has also advanced
with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) to assess China's knowledge
economy and requirements for technological innovation. The Third Asia Development Forum for regional
policymakers and others, organized jointly with ADB,
the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific, and other partners, also aimed at preparing for the future economy.

Regional Perspectives 71Box 4.3 East Timor: Where Is it Now?

In September 1999, East Timor was devastated by violence after

the East Timorese voted overwhetmingly to break from Indonesia.

Leading the coordination of the international community's
reconstruction efforts, the Bank has, over the last 18 months,
administered the Trust Fund for East Timor. The fund received
pledges of up to $166 million for basic reconstruction and
development works in nearly all sectors.

Progress has been remarkable. Within six months, grant
agreements for projects and programs in all sectors were
signed. By December 2000 economic activity was recovering;
projects supporting agriculture, community recovery, health,
education, sanitation, and infrastructure were under way; a
United Nations (U.N.) agency had set up power-sharing
arrangements with the East Timorese; and a schedule for elections was agreed on. The Bank has developed a Transition
Support Strategy to help East Timor as it moves toward postU.N. independence. The challenges ahead are enormous —
but within reach, if the success of the last two years provides
any indication.

Box 4.4 Innovating with Knowledge and Country
Development Partnerships: The Republic of Korea and
Thailand

Through partnerships established with countries such as Korea
and Thailand, the Bank is facilitating access to global development knowledge to reduce vulnerability and strengthen competitiveness. These have emerged as the central development
concerns in middte-income countries following the crisis.

The knowledge partnership with the Korean government is
contributing to Korea's efforts to become a more competitive,
knowledge-based economy and to transfer Korean development
experience to other countries. In June 2001 the Bank, jointly
with the Korean Development institute, organized a workshop
on business innovation systems, providing insights that can be
applied to other developing countries.

In Thailand, the Bank Is assisting the government via country development partnerships centered on technical assistance
and capacity-building needs, private sector and civil society
Involvement, and grant resource mobilization. The partnership
‘on competitiveness focuses on completing the reform agenda
and implementing the forward-tooking agenda—deepening
skills, strengthening innovation capabilities, and improving
logistics.

The World Bank Annual Report 2001

 

ment, improved social and infrastructure services,
and better environmental safeguarding. Bank assistance thus continues to emphasize public sector
transparency and accountability, and greater stakeholder participation in project design and implementation. Initiatives in Indonesia include anticorruption
and civil service reforms. The Indonesian-led Partnership for Governance Reform—a joint initiative with
the United Nations Development Programme—
facilitates a national dialogue on governance and is
funding innovative reform proposals from civil society and government agencies

Bank operations are adopting demand-oriented
and private sector approaches to service delivery,
particularly in infrastructure activities and with
emphasis on cost recovery. Decentralized public
sector decisionmaking and accountability are also
priorities. Indonesia's Provincial Health Project is
delivering services to the poor in the provinces of
Banten, North Sumatera, and West Java in an
increasingly decentralized environment The
Philippines’ Local Government Finance and
Development Project is making cities more livable
by expanding and upgrading basic infrastructure,
services, and facilities, as well as the capacity of
participating local governments In China, the
Economic Law Reform Project 1s financing technical
assistance for preparing economic laws, while the
Accounting Reform Project 1s helping government
auditors curb waste and other misuse of resources,
and strengthen public sector financial management.
In Thailand, Bank-funded surveys to gauge household, private sector, and public sector perceptions of
corruption have raised national awareness of, and
debate on, the problem.

Reducing vulnerability and ensuring that poor
people benefit from growth

Bank strategy has evolved from supporting safety nets
and crisis assessment to strengthening policies and
institutions that help households manage social nsks,
build social policy frameworks, and enable the poor
to participate in the benefits of growth. Social programs in low- as well as middle-income countries
have increasingly emphasized community empowerment and demand-driven approaches. In Cambodia
the Social Fund II Project is financing communitybased subprojects for infrastructure, creating employment opportunities, and strengthening communities
and local governments. Indonesia's KecamatanWorld Bank officials visit a school in Jakarta whose students received
scholarships from the National Scholarships and Grants Program, a
donor-supported program that helped poor families and schools face
the impact of the 1997-98 financial crisis

Development Project is helping 10,000 subdistricts
nationwide fund small-scale infrastructure projects or
income-generating activities; the project is strengthening local capacity, empowering village councils,
and improving community participation.

The Bank has also been supporting areas of
extreme poverty. Mongohia’s rural transport project 1s
improving poor communities’ access to health and
education services and facilitating private enterprise
and trade. In Vietnam, small-scale infrastructure and
hvelthood projects are being planned to tackle
poverty in some of the country’s poorest areas
through participatory, decentralized, and targeted
approaches. China's Tri-Provincial Highway Project
1s helping develop transport in three western
provinces while improving road access to poor counties to reduce income inequalities.

Improving the environment

With urbanization now embracing half the population in the region’s major countries, urban air and
water pollution is an extremely serious problem.
Together with the Ford Motor Company, ADB, and
the governments of Japan and the Netherlands, the
Bank has launched the Clean Air Initiative for Cities
of East Asia as a platform for knowledge sharing
among Asian cities. Assistance to countries includes

 

work with the Bangkok authorities to tackle motorcycle pollution; a multidonor report on China's environment and a report analyzing options for natural
resource management in Indonesia; and support for
projects in China with a strong environmental focus,
which have been the fastest-growing part of the
Bank's loan portfolio for that country ($1 2 billion
approved in fiscal 2000-01). For example, the
Sichuan Urban Environment Project is bringing
cleaner water and a healthier environment to six million low-income people in Sichuan while helping
protect and restore the Grand Buddha of Leshan, a
World Cultural Heritage site.

REGIONAL CONTEXT: GROWING STEADILY,
BUT BELOW POTENTIAL

At 5 8 percent, growth in South Asia in 2000 continued to be robust and sustained compared to the

rest of the world. Long-term growth continues to be
well below potential, however, and the 2000 outcome was also affected by drought that undermined
agricultural output in some parts of the region.
India’s GDP growth led the region at 6 percent,
while Bangladesh’s remained steady, at 5.2 percent
Strength in manufacturing and exports raised
Pakistan's growth slightly, to 3.8 percent.

The stability of South Asia’s growth is impressive, given recurrent natural disasters and continuing
political instability in some areas Drought struck
northern India, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, a massive
earthquake killed thousands in India. Other more
chronic obstacles to growth were poor governance,
cil conflict, and insufficient economic reforms.
The pace of India’s economic reforms has been
slowed by political challenges at the state level.
Pakistan continues to face pervasive, inherited governance problems and economrc distortions, confronting them effectively will be crucial to the
success of its Economic Revival Program introduced
in 2000 In Bangladesh, a sharply polarized political
environment prior to 2001 elections slowed implementation of second-generation reforms necessary to
accelerate growth and reduce poverty. Over the year,
political instability continued in Nepal, and in June
2001 the country suffered the tragedy of the royal
assassinations, Sri Lanka saw a combination of a
deepening of its 18-year conflict, a fragile ceasefire,
and pohttical volatility, and intense fighting continued in Afghanistan.

“We are happy that the World Bank
has come to talk directly to us. We
know what we need and we know how
to solve our problems better than anyone else. Come back again and keep

talking to us.”

Strategy consultations in Kohat district, Pakistan

South Asia's poverty continues to present a
profound development challenge Half a billion
people hve on less than $1 a day, accounting for 44
percent of the world’s poor. The illiteracy rate is the
world’s highest, and women have only about half as
many years of education as men. Lack of access to
health care, the continuing acceleration of HIV
infection, and environmental degradation are only a
few of the problems that threaten the region's prosperity and undermine the quality of hife for all, especially poor people

WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE: STRENGTHENING
PROSPECTS FOR LASTING DEVELOPMENT

The Bank's central goal in South Asia 1s reduction
of poverty and vulnerability, which it pursues by
promoting country and community ownership of
development efforts; responding quickly to crises;
supporting increased investment in human development, especially for marginalized groups; and
encouraging private sector—led and equitably
shared economic growth.

Box 4.5 Deepening the Development Dialogue In Pakistan

in preparing a new CAS, the Bank’s Pakistan team conducted consultations from the village to the national level, talking to farmers,
women’s groups, NGOs, trade unions, academia, media, government officials, and politicians. The team heard vorces of deep concern about widespread corruption, and despair about the lack of
economic opportunities, fair access to justice, education, and
health services, But it also heard creative ideas from people with a
great desire to make a difference in their own lives.

The CAS consultations helped the Bank identify local development needs and priorities as determined by the citizens themselves. It is hoped that the opening of this dialogue will lead to a
more inclusive development process in Pakistan,

consultations and interactive workshops that allowed
the Bank to bring its global development experience
to client countries while seeking local perspectives
on development priorities.
In India, over 300 politicians, civil servants, and
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) met at a
workshop on state-level reforms in December
2000—sponsored by the Bank, other donors, and
the Ministry of Finance—to exchange ideas with
global fiscal and governance experts, while a
number of large workshops at the federal level
also helped to examine fiscal, privatization, and
business-climate issues
Support for sector-level dialogue included a workshop in Pakistan on the sustainable provision of
water and sewerage services in Karachi, and a
series of consultations to help national and provincial authorities and other stakeholders better
understand the needs and concerns of road users.
Two journalism workshops aimed at strengthening
the media were sponsored by the World Bank
Institute’ one on economic reporting and one,
offered with support from the Commonwealth
Press Union, on corruption and journalism ethics.

The Bank is helping increase local ownership of
development efforts by empowering communities to
design and implement projects. For example, India’s
District Poverty Initiatives projects (in Andhra
Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan) and Rural

Water Supply and Environmental Samitation Project

closely involve rural communities in efforts to
increase their access to resources and improved serv-ices. Sri Lanka’s pilot Village Self-Help Learning
Initiative, meanwhile, includes a Village Community
Telecenter that relies on information technology
and communications to help reduce poverty in
remote villages. The project is funded by a Japanese
Social Development Fund Grant administered by
the Bank.

Working together to respond to crises

Bank assistance in fiscal 2001 helped address
needs arising from natural disaster- and conflictrelated crises, recognizing their devastating
impact on poor people. Response to India’s earthquake was quick, collaborative, and multidimensional (box 4.6). In drought- and conflict-ridden
Afghanistan, the Bank 1s helping the efforts of the
United Nations and other agencies to alleviate
famine and malnutrition among an estimated 12
mullion Afghanis (including those in refugee centers in neighboring Pakistan).

In Sri Lanka, the Bank-financed North-East
Irngated Agricultural Lands Project continues to
make progress amid the challenges of conflict. The
project aims to re-establish at least a subsistence
level of production and basic community services
through agricultural and small-scale reconstruction
activities. Partners include the government of Sn
Lanka, the focal communities, local NGOs, the
United Nations High Commission for Refugees,
and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Both parties to the conflict have been appreciative
of this work to assist some half a milion people in
the conflict zone.

Investing in people

The Bank’s support to South Asia recognizes the
centrality of education and health in poverty reduction. A new project in Bangladesh will strengthen
literacy programs and help the newly literate utilize
their skills, benefiting some 1 6 million of the
country’s poorest people, half of them women. Also
in Bangladesh, a new Legal and Judicial Capacity
Building Project will help improve access to justice, especially for the poor and women (see page
62). A distance-learning project—the first of its
kind in South Asia—offers videoconference and
Internet-based training opportunities to political
and business leaders in Sri Lanka, expanding their

access to global development knowledge. In
Pakistan, Bank participation in policy dialogue has
helped the government prepare a national education sector strategy.

In fiscal 2001 the Bank continued its strong
support for the region's health programs—which are
showing results A second project to deepen
HIV/AIDS prevention efforts 1s under way in India,
the first helped to launch a national control program, increase blood safety from 30 percent to
nearly 100 percent, sigmficantly reduce risky behavior, and raise condom use in high-risk groups.
Another follow-up project in India, this one
approved in fiscal 2001 to fight leprosy, will help
move India toward elimination of this disease; under
the first project, 4.4 milhon patients received treatment, and registered leprosy cases fell from over 1
million in 1993 to 500,000 in 2000. In fiscal 2001
the Bank also approved an HIV/AIDS Prevention
Project in Bangladesh, targeting high-risk groups

In addition, the Bank 1s helping combat tuberculosis (TB) in South Asia, which has 3 of the 10
countries with the world’s highest TB incidence In
India the Bank supports a revised national TB control program, which treated 1.] million patients in
1999 and nsing in 2000 under DOTS (Directly

Box 4.6 Disaster Response: Multidimensional
Assistance, Partnership, and Participation

On january 26, 2001, a severe earthquake hit India’s Gujarat
state, leaving over 20,000 people dead, nearly a million
families homeless, social infrastructure destroyed, and a
government suddenly faced with an immense chatlenge.

The Bank quickly made $400 million available for emergency
rehabilitation and partnered with counterparts from the Asian
Development Bank to prepare a comprehensive damage
assessment (http://www.worldbank.org/gujarat “8 ),
crucial to shaping a recovery plan and guiding cooperation
among all parties.

Reconstruction needs are estimated at a staggering $2.3
billion. The Bank’s emergency assistance of $400 million provides short-term financing for temporary shelter, rubble
removal, health and education services, rehabilitation of
basic infrastructure, community capacity building, and establishment of disaster management capabilities. A longer-term
reconstruction credit is under preparation. in close consultation with Indian authorities, the Bank is urging the active participation of affected communities in all reconstruction
efforts.

sion). The Bank is also supporting efforts to expand

DOTS in Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Promoting private sector growth

A dynamic private sector 1s crucial for growth—and
thus central to the Bank’s country programs. India’s
Rajasthan Power Sector Restructuring Project,
approved in fiscal 2001, continues the Bank's
support for private provision of infrastructure in the
region It will help advance the privatization of distribution firms and promote small-scale power generation as well as renewable energy production for
remote locales The Pakistan Trade and Transport
Facilitation Project, also approved in fiscal 2001,
will help the country modernize and reform its transport sector. Lower transport costs will help
Pakistan’s industries become more competitive in
international markets.

In fiscal 2001 the IFC, the Bank Group’s pnvate investment—promotion arm, continued to complement Bank assistance for the region’s private

Europe and Central Asia

REGIONAL CONTEXT: GROWING ECONOMIES,
NEED FOR STRONGER BUSINESS CLIMATE

The year 2000 marks the first year in the past
decade when all transition countries experienced
positive growth Growth in Central Europe and the
Baltics averaged 4 percent, the highest during the
last five years. The Baltic countries, Croatia, the
Czech Republic, and Romania started to grow again
after having stabilized their economies in the previous year. Overall, growth in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) countries reached a
record high of 7.4 percent, led by the Russian
Federation’s strong economic recovery fueled by
higher energy prices and the post-1998 currency
depreciation.

Barring a sharp decline in growth in Western
Europe, economic growth 1s expected to remain
strong in most of the region into 2001. Many of the
new administrations in Central Europe and the
Baltics are accelerating reforms, and the European
Union (EU) accession process has become an
important catalyst. Continued growth in the Russian
Federation and Ukraine will depend crucially on
improving the environment for business and private
investment. Such improvement could not only raise
the present low levels of domestic and foreign direct
investment but also spur growth of new small- and
medium-size firms—a major factor in the growth of
the Baltics and Central Europe

Major developments have occurred in Turkey
and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia In late 2000,
the new administration of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia embarked upon a reform program to facilitate the transition to a market economy, and reestablished links with the international community

The World Bank Annual Report 2001

“In Poland I turned to the World Bank with
which we had already established a good working
relationship through the transition years. Because
it is independent, the Bank can help give a
credible start to anticorruption initiatives. It
helped us with the analytical work and advised
us on the policy and technical reforms that can
help to minimize corruption.”

Leszek Balcerowicz, op-ed in Segodnya (Russian Federation
newspaper). September 2000.

In Turkey, the macroeconomic stabilization program
suffered a major setback in February 2001, and output is expected to decline this year The currency
depreciated sharply and major losses occurred in the
banking sector. A comprehensive structural reform
of the pubhc and financial sectors accelerated in the
spring, alongside implementation of agricultural
reform.

WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE: CREATING JOBS,
PROTECTING THE VULNERABLE, FIGHTING
CORRUPTION

Poverty has increased substantially in the Europe
and Central Asia (ECA) region over the last decade,
resultung from the deep economic recessions imitiated by the transition process Helping countries

to move to a sustainable growth path—and to
ensure that growth translates into jobs and improved
living standards—continues to be a major component of the Bank’s poverty reduction strategy, with
efforts to help improve the business climate A
second component is support for realigning public
expenditures to protect extensive achievements in
education and health, and improving the targeting of
social protection programs toward the most vulnerable. Improving governance and institutional
structures to serve the broader public interest, with
a strong focus on anticorruption and communitydriven development, marks a third component of the
Bank's strategy. This strategy incorporates lessons
learned from the past decade of transition experience (see http:/Awww.worldbank.org/eca/
publications @ )

The Bank continues to play a key role in supporting peace and economic recovery in South East
Europe. With other partners, it has helped the new
government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
prepare an Economic Recovery and TransitionProgram, and cosponsored a donor conference to
raise funds for this Program. The Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia became a member of the World Bank
in May, after agreement was reached on a plan to
resolve its arrears to the IBRD The Bank prepared
a Transitional Support Strategy, and start-up activities are being financed by a $30 million trust fund
The Bank is also helping Kosovo rebuild its economy and 1s continuing its support for regional initiataves in South East Europe, including the Trade and
Transport Facilitation Program. Under this program,
Bank-financed projects in six South East European
countries will help reduce nontanff transport costs
and reduce smuggling and corruption at border
crossings by supporting reforms and financing cnitical infrastructure and equipment needs.

The Bank moved rapidly to support the new
economic program of Turkey by preparing a series
of adjustment loans to accelerate structural reform
and mitigate social risks. A loan supporting the initial phase of financial sector reforms was approved
in December 2000.

Improving the business climate

Growth and job creation have been much stronger
in countries experiencing rapid growth of new small
and medium enterprises (SMEs). Improving the
business climate, especially for SMEs, has become a
key focus of adjustment operations. The Armenia
Fourth Structural Adjustment Credit, for example,
aims to improve the business climate by rationalizing
the system of business inspections, streamlining
business registration and licensing procedures, and
reforming the tax and customs administration as
well as the public procurement system, to create a
level playing field, especially for new businesses.
Armenia, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine are
initiating a series of regular business surveys to monitor progress on efforts to reduce public interference
in business activity

Ensuring essential social services

The Bank continues to help countries reform their
safety nets to ensure greater financial sustainability
and better targeting For example, a new IDA credit
to Bosma and Herzegovina supports pension reform,
while an IBRD loan will help Turkey finance severance payments and labor redeployment services as
the economy restructures. Loans to Azerbaijan,
Bulgaria, Georgia, and Moldova are helping governments undertake major restructuring in their health

Box 4.7 Promoting Community-Based Services for
Vulnerable Children

Today nearly a million children live “lives of quiet desperation” in
institutions across the region, according to a report of the joint
United Nations Children’s Fund-World Bank project “Changing
Minds, Policies and Lives.” The project aims to promote systemic
change in the region from reliance on state institutions to strengthened family and community-based services for vulnerable children.
Over the past three years the Bank has supported efforts in
Armenia, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Moldova, and Romania to establish
viable alternatives to institutionalization.

Romania has pioneered community-based alternatives to institutionalization with the help of a $5 million Learning and Innovation
Loan as part of a larger $29 million program supported also by the
EU, U.S. Agency for international Development, Council of Europe
Development Bank, and some international NGOs. This support has
enabled the government to close down large institutions, prevent
abandonment, and move children to family-friendly environments.
Bulgaria’s Child Welfare Reform Project follows a similar approach,
benefiting 40,000 institutionalized chitdren. Partnering with police,
who are usually the first to come into contact with problematic
family situations, marks an innovative feature of the project.
Preventive actions include working with disadvantaged ethnic
communities (such as the Roma who account for the majority of
institutionalized children) to improve basic preschool education
and day care.

cial reform, and building public oversight, transparency, and accountability in the use of public
resources. In the past year the Bank has assisted
Bosma and Herzegovina, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz
Republic, Romania, and the Russian Federation in
carrying out corruption surveys, which provide the
basis for devising country-specific anticorruption
strategies. Support to Ukraine has helped the government take steps to eliminate nontransparent netting
operations between government entities, streamline
hcensing procedures, and reduce the number of
inspections, while promoting the adoption of
improved accounting standards and disclosure procedures, as well as civil society involvement, in the
budget process. Projects under development in FYR

REGIONAL CONTEXT: IMPROVING
MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS, BUT
INEQUALITIES PERSIST

In 2000 most Latin American and Caribbean (LAC)
economies were on the path of recovery after the
shocks triggered by the 1998-99 crises in Asia and
the Russian Federation. The region’s GDP grew by
3 8 percent over the year, responding to stabilized
global financial markets and 13 percent growth in
world trade. Most macroeconomic indicators
improved Inflation fell or remained stable in most
countries, allowing interest rates to continue falling.
Unemployment dropped in Brazil, Chile, and
Mexico, it remained high, however, in Argentina,
Colombia, and Peru, where political problems contnbuted to slowing growth Slower growth in the
United States could affect prospects for the region’s
sustained recovery.

Strong trade—at 51.5 percent of LAC’s GDP,
nearly double the proportion of a decade ago—and
high oil prices eased balance of payments pressures
in the region High oil prices helped Colombia,
Ecuador, Mexico, and the Republica Bolivariana
de Venezuela but increased the burden on oil
importers, particularly in Central American and
Caribbean countries, which already faced price
declines for their commodity exports. Oil exporters’
higher surpluses narrowed the region's current
account deficit from $55 billion in 1999 to $47 billion in 2000—about 2.5 percent of GDP. The oil
price boom prompted a temporary dip in the need
for foreign savings and, accordingly, a drop in net
resource flows to the region. Net foreign direct

“Perhaps one of the most important
aspects of our partnership with the

project cofinanced by the government and
the World Bank is the integration of drug
users into public health interventions.
The financing shows the Bank's recognition of the importance of the work we do
with drug users, and not just for them.”

Domiciano Siquiera of ABORDA, an NGO working

investment dropped from a historic high of $90 bilhon in 1999 to a still significant $76 billion in 2000
Despite economic growth, about a third of the
region's population still lives on less than $2 a day,
and deep inequalities persist in most countries
Expanding poor people’s access to health, education, and water services remains a priority, particularly for countries hit by severe natural disasters
In addition, a continentwide trend toward decentralization of powers and responsibilities 1s creating
an urgent need for the region’s state, provincial,
and municipal governments to build their capacity
to deliver quality public services, especially to
poor people.

WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE: INVESTING IN
PEOPLE, MANAGING DISASTER RECOVERY,
SUPPORTING DECENTRALIZATION

In fiscal 2001 the Bank helped LAC countries
reduce poverty by supporting human development
and disaster reconstruction programs and, in the
poorest countries, providing debt relief In the
region's larger countries, it helped strengthen the
public sector and reform governance systems, often
to accommodate the shifting of responsibilities from
central to decentralized authorities. The Bank also
participated in a major multilateral effort to help
Argentina address its recession by indicating readiness to commit up to $2.4 billion over 2001 and
2002 as part of a $39.7 billion IMF-backed package.
Throughout the region, wide consultations with
stakeholders are a priority to ensure ownership—and
therefore greater sustainability—of development
efforts (box 4.8).

Box 4.8 Wider Consultations: The Bank’s New Approach to
Developing Strategy

With globalization, and civil society deeply engaged in public
policy debates, the Bank is consulting with stakeholders more
than ever in developing assistance strategies for LAC countries.
In Argentina, a new Country Assistance Strategy drew perspectives from over 4,000 representatives from nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), unions, companies, religious groups, and
academic institutions who attended Bank-organized meetings
across the country. Participants discussed studies on topics
ranging from education and judiciat reform to transportation and
the financial sector. Similar processes have been completed, or
are under way or planned, in several other countries.

In Mexico, the July 2000 election that resulted in a change of
government was followed in October by a Bank-sponsored policy
seminar attended by decisionmakers from the outgoing and
incoming teams. The seminar focused on analyses and recommendations prepared by Bank staff in 36 areas ranging from
macroeconomic policy to human development.

Investing in people

Support for investing in people is a priority in IBRDas well as IDA-eligible countries. New Bank assistance was approved in fiscal 2001 for vulnerable
children’s education and health in Colombia, basic
education in Brazil and Panama, water and sanitation in Ecuador, and social protection in Argentina
and Colombia—raising the Bank's regional portfolio
of ongoing projects in health, education, and social
protection to $7.2 billion. The portfolio includes
efforts to address inequalities. As part of an overall
strategy to focus efforts in Brazil's poorest region, for
example, the Bank is supporting a government initiative to provide land and capital to about 50,000
farmers in the northeast.

The Bank’s $2.6 billion health care portfolio in
LAC includes Mexico's five-year-old program to
expand health-care coverage; 8.1 million poor people, mostly in small communities with no previous
coverage, now have access. In the Caribbean, the
Bank is helping attack the world’s highest HIV
prevalence rate outside Sub-Saharan Africa, with a
$155 million program to support HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment programs in several countries,
starting with Barbados and the Dominican Republic.
Support for Brazil's efforts to curb the spread of
HIV/AIDS has yielded good results, with a halving
in the number of such deaths since 1993 (box 4.9).

The Bank has provided over $2 billion since
1998 to improve education for poor people, with
projects ranging from primary education in rural
areas of Brazil, E] Salvador, and Nicaragua, to postsecondary student loan programs in Mexico. In El
Salvador, three loans totaling $148 million have supported a community-managed schools program
(EDUCO) to strengthen preschool and primary education, as well as a program for secondary education.
EDUCO, which brought schools and teachers to
many poor rural areas for the first time, has raised
the country’s primary enrollment to almost 85 percent, up from 78 percent in 1996. The EDUCO
model has been used to develop similar projects in
Guatemala and Honduras, also with Bank support.In some of

The agreements will reduce, over time and from all
creditors, Nicaragua's debt service by $4.5 billion,
Honduras’s by $900 million, and Guyana’s by $590
million, in addition to the $1.3 billion debt service
reduction for Bolivia approved in fiscal 2000.

Supporting natural disaster recovery and
preparedness

Recovery from natural disasters remained a high
priority in Central America. The Bank helped
Belize, Honduras, and Nicaragua continue to
rebuild after the devastation of Hurricane Mitch in
1998. In El! Salvador, $33 million in education loans
were reprogrammed to finance reconstruction of
schools damaged in the two earthquakes of January
and February 2001 The Bank is also supporting
prevention efforts in Domimeca, Grenada, Mexico,
St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and
the Grenadines to reduce loss of life and material
damage caused by natural disasters A $60 million

HIV/AIDS

Two Bank loans totaling $325 miltion—approved in fiscat 1994
and fiscal 1999—have helped Brazit reduce the spread of
HIV/AIDS, and enabled Brazilians with AIDS to live longer. The
first $160 million loan supported over 400 grassroots projects
run by 175 NGOs in cooperation with state and municipal governments. They distributed over 180 million condoms, raised
HIV/AIDS awareness among over half a million people at risk,
and trained 3,800 teachers and 32,500 students in promoting
HIV/AIDS and drug abuse prevention.

The project, now in a second phase and supported by a
$165 million toan, has helped reduce the number of deaths
due to AIDS by 50 percent since 1993. Persons living with
HIV/AIDS also receive care through the project, because it supports AIDS care units and home-care teams throughout the
country, But prevention remains the project's focus. It has
helped finance a nationwide network of 170 HIV/AIDS testing
and counseling centers and 800 diagnostic and treatment centers, and in partnership with the National Business AIDS.
Council, it enabled 3,000 companies to offer HIV/AIDSawareness training to three to five million workers,

Benefiting poor people in Pompoa, Honduras, this subproject is one of
over 15,000 small-scale, community-driven public investments financed
since 1990 by the Honduras Social investment Fund. A fifth IDA credit

of $60 million was approved in fiscal 2001, bringing the total value of

the programs to $300 million.

Strengthening the public sector

Lending to subnational governments emerged as a
major new Bank activity in LAC in 2001. The Bank
is helping Argentina’s Catamarca and Cérdoba
provinces, for example, to reform public finance and
administration to ensure that decentralized health
care, education, and public safety services are of
high quality and accessible to the poor.

In Mexico, the Bank has supported the federal
government's efforts to facilitate structural reforms
in the country’s states, including a $505 million fastdisbursing loan to the Estado de México (the country’s largest state) in fiscal 2001. Support to Mexico
has included a study of the challenges inherent in
devolving responsibilities to state and municipal governments, including analysis of taxation, transfer
payments, and dispute settlement mechanisms.

Two projects are helping Brazil’s state governments in Bahia and Cear4 improve basic education
systems. Also in Brazil, the Bank is supporting the
government's fiscal stability program with a $758
million loan focused on fiscal discipline by states
and municipalities, federal debt management, and
public expenditure management.Table 4.5 World Bank Lending to Borrowers in Latin America and the Caribbean, by Sector, Fiscal 1992-2001

REGIONAL CONTEXT: IMPROVING
PERFORMANCE, STILL FACING SERIOUS
CHALLENGES

Starting in the late 1980s many of the economies
of the Middle East and North Africa (MNA)
region committed to far-reaching economic
reforms to restore macroeconomic balances and
promote development led by the private, rather
than the public, sector Economic performance
improved annual GDP growth increased from
2 4 percent in 1981-90 to 3.1 percent in the
1991-2000 period, as well as over the past year
Despite the improved performance, the
region faces serious economic and social challenges.
The break in the peace process, resulting in border
closures, has posed severe problems in the West
Bank and Gaza. Unemployment rates, averaging
over 15 percent regionally, are of mounting concern
Much of the region is still characterized by large
public sectors, with centralized governments, overstaffed civil services, and weak systems of accountability Several countries continue to be extremely
vulnerable to weather and commodity price shocks
due to their hmited economic resource base. Basic
infrastructure and services vital for private sector
growth remain weak. Integration with the rest of
the world still lags behind other developing
economies in Asia and Latin America Poverty,
though relatively low by some income measures,
persists in large pockets throughout the region.

WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE: SUPPORTING THE
PRIVATE SECTOR, PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, AND
HUMAN RESOURCES

The diversity of the MNA region's challenges calls
for customized Bank assistance. Fiscal 2001 was
marked by continued support for chent-driven services to alleviate poverty, rapid response to severe
economic shocks in the West Bank and Gaza
(through grant and concessional financing provided
by the Bank's Trust Fund for Gaza and the West
Bank), and reimbursable technical assistance to the
Gulf Cooperation Council countries as well as
Malta and Libya—whose incomes make them ineligible for IBRD lending but which benefit from advisory services 1n a wide range of areas

The Bank's assistance strategy to MNA countries
focused on three priority areas in fiscal 2001. The
first was helping strengthen the overall climate for
investment and private sector—led growth—cntical
for employment generation—by maintaining macroeconomic stability and pursuing efficiency-enhancing
policy reform A second priority was support for
strengthening public sector management and
institution building through more efficient use of
budgetary resources and enhanced mechanisms for
participation. Bank assistance also focused on social
protection and human resource development by
helping countries improve the quality and coverage of
education and health-care services, reduce disparities
in incomes and access to services through targeted
community-based development, and protect the vulnerable with effective social policies In addition,
support for knowledge sharing through the Global
Development Learning Network (GDLN) strengthens prospects for empowerment of people and
increases the region's productivity (box 4.10).The Bank increasingly depends upon partnerships in the development process. Broad consultation with civil society and the poor is essential to
better understanding their needs and helping them
plan and implement their own development strategies. In Morocco, for example, the Bank organized
consultations with over 55 civil society representatives to inform the preparation of its Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS). Partnership with other
development organizations is equally vital, to share
knowledge and avoid gaps and overlaps in activities.
For example, the Bank-sponsored Palestinian nongovernmental organization (NGO) project (Phase II
approved in fiscal 2001), designed to strengthen
NGOs’ capacity to deliver improved services to the
poor, has drawn international attention to the
approach of relying on NGOs’ comparative advantages in addressing the needs of poor people.
Partnership has also helped Egyptian women obtain
identification cards (see box 4.11).

North Africa region in the fiscal 1992-2001 period.
Table 8.7 (see About the World Bank) compares commitments, disbursements, and net transfers to the

Strengthening the climate for investment and private sector—led growth

Sustained growth that raises incomes and extends
benefits to the poor is critical for poverty reduction
and job creation. Helping countries pursue faster,
sustainable growth is a defining theme of Bank support to the MNA region, both through CASs
(Djibouti and Morocco, and an interim assistance
strategy for the Islamic Republic of Iran) and
sources of growth studies (Jordan and Lebanon). To
promote private sector development, the Bank

Box 4.10 MNA Joins the Global Development Learning
Network (GDLN)

With some 25 countries around the world connected to the
GDLN, this year saw the opening of the first two GDLN centers in
the MNA region, in Jordan and Egypt (with Egypt’s GDLN soon to
become fuily operational). Plans are under way for a center in
Saudi Arabia. Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and the Republic of
Yemen have also expressed interest in being connected.

The GDLN provides a platform for developing countries to
exchange information. As other MNA economies link to the
GDLN, the network offers great potential to become a powerful
facility for collaborative information-sharing on issues common
to the region, with substantial benefit for effective policymaking.
At the country level, sharing of information among the government, civil society, and interested parties also promotes participation in the development process. By enabling the exchange of
experience among countries, the GDLN offers a potentially
important vehicle for finding common solutions to problems facing the MNA region.

Public sector management and institution building

Institution building, to improve public sector
accountability and efficiency, is a key theme of Bank
assistance to the MNA region. In fiscal 2001 the
Bank helped strengthen the public administration's
ability to provide basic social and infrastructure services through, for example, support for long-term
education strategies in Djibouti, Morocco, and the
Republic of Yemen, and for pension system improvements in Dyibouti and the West Bank and Gaza.
Other new operations reinforced local public institutional capacity (Morocco and the Republic of
Yemen), making public expenditure more efficient.
They also pave the way for greater decentralization
as well as reliance on civil society and the private
sector in planning and dehvering public services.
The Bank also supported budgetary systems in
Algeria, Jordan, and the Republic of Yemen, for an
innovative and comprehensive public sector reform
credit Important capacity-building activities were
initiated in Egypt in the area of project appraisal,
monitoring, and evaluation.

Social protection and human resource
development

Although MNA‘s poverty rates are relatively low,
other social indicators signal a more serious poverty
problem In fiscal 2001 the Bank continued to build
knowledge on poverty, through reviews and assessments (Egypt, Morocco, and the West Bank and
Gaza). Helping countries address the survival needs
of those in society who are unable adequately toThrough the joint efforts of the World Bank and a focal civil society
organization, women in Egypt are finally getting registered, and gaining access to important social and education services.

Box 4.11 Helping Alleviate Poverty among Egyptian
Women: The Power of Partnership

In many of the poorer communities In Egypt, people— particularly
women—are not registered at birth, making it impossible for
them to access basic rights and services. tn fiscal 2001 the
Bank’s MNA staff teamed up with an Egyptian civil society organization, the Egyptian Center for Women’s Rights, to support
women’s access to identification cards and birth certificates,
through the Bank-sponsored Development Marketplace. The project funded some of the costs of issuing identification cards in the
Greater Cairo area and raised awareness among other NGOs, the
media, the general public, and the government. As a result of the
campaign, women who have received Identification cards are filing for and receiving inheritances, registering for literacy classes,
voting, and receiving pensions,

 

 

help themselves has also been a priority. An
Emergency Response Program 1n the West Bank and
Gaza, for example, created labor-intensive emergency employment activities for thousands of persons facing severe economic hardship. The Bank
also helped countries design and implement safety
nets in fiscal 2001, with an assessment of social protection in Egypt and preparation of a comprehensive
regional study of social protection schemes

Rural and community development have
emerged as important areas of Bank support, with
targeted community development (Lebanon and the
West Bank and Gaza), and support for rural infrastructure (Morocco and the Republic of Yemen).
Support for expanding access to safe water in the
Republic of Yemen is also allowing tremendous savings of time devoted to collecting water—particularly for women and girls, who can instead pursue
schooling. New Bank operations in MNA, recognizing the vital role of water management, have supported irrigation improvement (Morocco and the
Republic of Yemen), water resource management
(Jordan and the Syrian Arab Republic), and agricultural competitiveness assessments (Egypt and
Morocco). The Bank also sponsored the Nile Basin
Initiative in fiscal 2001 to foster constructive dialogue among the Nile’s 10 riparian states and generate win-win solutions to the problem of Nile
water-sharing. In addition, it chaired an important
meeting of the International Consortium for
Cooperation on the Nile in June 2001.

Helping expand access to education and health
services remains a cornerstone of the Bank’s work in
supporting poverty reduction. In fiscal 2001 the
Bank continued its long-standing commitment to
education in MNA with support for education projects in Djibouti, the West Bank and Gaza, and the
Republic of Yemen. Responding to the government’s
concern over the implications of fast-growing university enrollments, the Bank also produced an analysis
on rationalizing higher education in the Republic of
Yemen. Support in fiscal 2001 for sanitation and
solid waste management, meanwhile, will help
improve public health and quality of life in the West
Bank and Gaza and the Republic of Yemen

Development Effectiveness

The bottom line for the World Bank 1s its development effectiveness The independent Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) tracks the Bank's
development performance, analyzing the effectiveness of Bank projects, programs, and processes;
draws lessons of operational experience, and provides advice to the Board based on evaluations at
the project, country, and sector levels. OED also
guides evaluation capacity development in chent
countries Each year, evidence from these evaluations 1s marshaled to produce a summary report on
the Bank's development effectiveness.

This year's Annual Renew of Development
Effectrveness (ARDE) confirms that the Bank’s development performance has improved significantly over
the past five years. This improvement is clearly evident at the project level In particular, the quality of
IDAs work in the poorest countnes has improved,
though further gains are necessary

PROJECT PERFORMANCE IS IMPROVING

The performance of Bank-supported projects has
improved markedly and contributed to better development results, as reported in the ARDE. Preliminary
results show an increase from 73 percent of closed
projects with satisfactory outcomes in fiscal 1999 to

Figure 5.1 Trends in Project Outcomes

(percent of projects with satisfactory outcomes)

80

78 percent in fiscal 2000, when weighted by the
number of projects (figure 5 1) In addition, 43 percent of the projects resulted in substantial institutional development impact—an increase from 31
percent in 1990-94—and projects with benefits sustainable over the long term rose to 57 percent from
48 percent just two years earher

The quality of adjustment lending improved
steadily and markedly throughout the 1990s, as measured, inter alia, by OED ratings for outcome, sustainabihty, and institutional development impact (figure
5 2), the poverty and social focus of adjustment lending has also increased substantially over time A retrospective undertaken in fiscal 2001 also found that
adjustment lending has become an important developmental instrument that has evolved in tandem with
countries’ broader reform agendas, focused increasingly on long-run structural, social, and institutional
issues. Further work is under way, including on social
impact, conditionality, and fiduciary framework

Overall, the increased share of closed projects
with satisfactory outcomes reflects the steady
improvement in the quality of ongoing projects, as
reported by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG)
Created in 1996, QAG has played a key role in
improving the development effectiveness of Bank

Box 5.1 Building Partnerships for Project Supervision

Strong partnerships in project supervision pay rich dividends:
greater likelihood of development Impact, better chance for success of complex project designs, and lower cost of supervision
for project financters, Building effective alliances among the
client, stakeholders, and donors has become a growing priority.
In the Peru Rural Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project,
for example, teams from the Bank and the Inter-American
Development Bank (a cofinancier) furnish complementary skills
and coordinate their field visits. The supervision teams also
interact extensively with local government and communities,
which play a significant role in the project’s successful implementation,

Increasing development effectiveness through partnerships
is a process of continuous learning. Key factors are a willingness
to listen, establishment of common goals and roadmaps to
achieve them, and adjustment of work processes in the interest
of compatibility. Greater progress in harmonizing donor procedures remains an important challenge in this regard.

time information on projects’ quality and nsk. With
sustained effort, the Bank's portfolio of active projects is now healthier than it has been since the early
1980s. At the end of fiscal 2001 only 12 percent of
projects were “at risk” of not achieving their development objectives, compared with more than double
that ratio in fiscal 1996. The quality of project
preparation and supervision has also improved significantly, as has the Bank's analytical (economic
and sector) work. The improvements over the fiveyear period, moreover, have been broad-based, and
have benefited from heightened efforts to work in
consultation and partnership with others (box 5.1).
The Bank has made other advances in improving

The World Bank Annual Report 2001

development effectiveness The dollar amount of
active projects supporting public sector governance
and institutional reform—which strongly affect how
aid funds are used—has doubled over the past five
years, about half of all adjustment loans have had
fiscal transparency and anticorruption components
The Bank has also substantially strengthened comphance with safeguard and fiduciary policies—which
promote project sustainability when applied pragmatically—and improved projects’ financial management,
with a near quadrupling of financial management
specialists and substantial reliance on new Country
Financial Accountability Assessments In another
crucial yet difficult area, the Bank has launched new
efforts to improve monitoring and evaluation of
development outcomes; sustained efforts will be
required, over several years, for results to become
evident. Finally, decentralization of Bank staff to the
field is beheved to be beneficial. As the number of
field offices, country directors in the field, and operations being prepared and supervised by staff in the
field have increased, key quality indicators have
improved, with strongly supportive chent feedback.

ASSESSING COUNTRY PROGRAM PERFORMANCE

To ascertain whether the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategies (CASs) have delivered results on the
ground, OED uses three complementary evaluation
methods: aggregating performance information on
individual lending and nonlending activities; relating
the inputs to country assistance programs to their
outputs, outcomes, and impacts; and assessing the
performance of the Bank against its own policy
benchmarks and procedures along with the performance of other actors.

This approach has allowed OED to identify the
most important determinants of country program
outcomes: borrower commitment and the extent to
which Bank strategies, programs, processes, and
partnerships have been adapted to the country setting. These findings demonstrate that instruments
for assessing ownership, such as stakeholder analysis, should be used more widely than they have been
in CAS formulation as well as in the design and execution of policy reforms and development programs.

Analysis of OED data suggests that sound
macroeconomic policies and high-quality institutions
increase the effectiveness of development investments. The Bank's research confirms that countrypolicies have improved during the 1990s, and that
overall bilateral and multilateral aid was better targeted to countries endowed with policies that provide a suitable framework for effective development
assistance. Conversely, countries with poor enabling
environments received less aid (see figure 5.3).

IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN IDA
COUNTRIES

The performance of IDA over recent years has
improved, OED conducted a review of the implementation of undertakings under IDA-10, IDA-11,
and the first year of IDA-12. These undertakings
included (1) sharpening the poverty focus of support for country development, (2) expanding access
to social services, fostering broad-based growth, promoting good governance, and integrating gender and
environmental considerations into development
efforts, and (3) increasing effectiveness through
more selective, more thorough, and better-coordinated CASs

OED’s review found that these undertakings
were highly relevant and tmely They encouraged
IDA to move in step with the evolving consensus of
the international development community. But they
also were extraordinarily demanding for both IDA
and its borrowers. Overall, OED found IDA’s implementation of these undertakings to be satisfactory,
but with qualifications IDA has strengthened the
poverty focus of its analytical work, policy dialogue,
and lending. In countries committed to economic
reform, it has contributed to increased economic
stability, fewer distortions, and improved infrastructure development. But broad-based, job-creating
growth remains a challenge. Moreover, IDA was
slow to comply with its governance undertakings,
although its performance has improved considerably
over the past five years. Progress in mainstreaming
gender, environmental, and private sector development objectives has proven challenging—reflecting a
lack of interest by many countries—and led to the
design of new thematic strategies.

IDA project performance has improved steadily
over the period (see figure 5 4) Outcomes of completed projects have risen to more than 70 percent
satisfactory. Sustainability and institutional development impact also have improved. Much progress can
be seen in project-level outcomes as well as in quality indicators coming from QAG assessments.

Overall, the OED review found the development
outcomes of IDA programs—influenced by exogenous factors and borrower and partner performance,

recent initiatives geared to improving coordination

IDA countries.

SECTOR AND THEMATIC PERFORMANCE IS
STARTING TO SHOW RESULTS

The Bank's move beyond projects toward the higher
plane of country strategy has been paralleled by a
shift toward improving sector and thematic performance, at both the country and global levels The
challenge has been to strengthen the strategic
focus and policy content of services within particular
sectors and to mtegrate crosscutting thematic priorities—including poverty, participation, and gender—
into the range of Bank activities

The ARDE'’s findings suggest that the Bank’s
efforts to improve development effectiveness during
the past five years are starting to show results,
although not uniformly across sectors. OED’s analysis of sector and thematic performance suggests that
four factors are associated with successful sector
strategies a clear policy framework; an action plan
to improve on past performance, a specific program
of development assistance at the country and global
levels, and a definition of the Bank's role taking
account of partners’ activities

OED’s analysis also confirms that the Bank
has strengthened the poverty focus of its operations.
The considerable growth of poverty assessment
activities, the expansion of social sector lending,
the increased decentralization of country assistance
management, and the increased focus on governance concerns have contributed to this wholesome
trend. But more needs to be done to integrate
broad-based poverty reduction strategies into
macroeconomic and sector programs and to
strengthen poverty monitoring and evaluation

THE BANK IS PROMOTING PARTICIPATION AND
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT

The World Bank has made participation a central
feature of its development efforts since the mid1990s. It has expanded its work with regional and
local governments in borrowing countries, cultivated
new development partners and intensified its
engagement with existing ones, and opened dialogue

The World Bank Annual Report 2001

Box 5.2 OED Uses Participatory Approaches in Evaluation

The participatory consultation process for OED’s evaluation products has included sharing design formats, eliciting information on
performance and processes, and disseminating findings to stakehoiders through workshops. Here are the highlights:
A joint workshop with the Bank's research arm, the
Development Economics and Data Group, brought together
donors, country participants, nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs), and partners from borrowing countries to discuss the
approach and design of an evaluation of the CDF.
In conjunction with the initiation of a review of global public
goods, an entry workshop of 50 participants discussed issues
in financing and evaluation in the areas of environment,
health, knowledge, and financial stability.
The Forestry Review conducted workshops at entry, mid-point,
and exit that included a wide range of participants from both
inside and outside the Bank.
The Environment and Soctal Funds Reviews engaged in broad
stakeholder participation at entry and mid-point in their evaluations.
The Gender Review engaged stakeholders from across regions
and numerous partners including bilateral donors, NGOs,
client country representatives, the United Nations, and the
European Union,
The India Country Assistance Evaluation involved stakeholders
across a number of sectors, ministries, and organizations.
Workshops have been part of OED’s dissemination strategy for
the ARDE, Aid Coordination Study, and Forestry Review,
among others.

approaches in evaluation (see box 5.2).

The participatory process has involved a wide
range of interactions, on many fronts, between the
Bank and its chents and partners, but few objectives
are more important than institutional development.
Institutional development has become a focus of
Bank lending in its own right, increasing from 18
percent of total lending in 1996 to 30 percent in
2000

Community participation has become especially
important to the Bank’s efforts to build lasting institutions Since 1992 the percentage of projects with
community participation has increased from 41
percent to 67 percent (see figure 5 5) OED has
found that this participation helped beneficianes tai-Figure 5.5 Percentage of Projects with Community

contracting, fostered cooperation among people who

had not traditionally worked together; and led to
better development results.

MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS

The results of OED’s studies have three implications
for corporate management First, Bank strategies,
programs, and budgeting processes need to be
strongly linked to the achievement of results consistent with the Bank’s mission and comparative
advantage. Second, the Bank needs to strike an
appropnate balance between knowledge management and knowledge creation—at both the country
and global levels—and establish monitoring and
tracking processes to strengthen the quality and
coherence of its knowledge activities Finally, the
Bank must continuously assess its comparative
advantage so as to improve its development effectiveness and to withdraw from activities better
carried out by other development partners

Partnerships for Development

Coming out of the World Bank's renewal since
1997, partnership has become a way of doing business for the Bank The Bank is investing considerably in collaborative efforts, albeit with greater
selectivity over the past year Such investment has
meant intensified relationships with client governments and shareholders—the Bank’s foremost
partners—as well as with the Bank's main institutional partners, and broad efforts to improve collaboration with other actors in development, such as
civil society and the business sector

At the country level, collaboration with highlevel government, parliaments, the private sector,
civil society, and multilateral and bilateral donors has
intensified and broadened. The principles underlying
the Comprehensive Development Framework
(CDF)—a hohstic approach to development,
stronger country ownership, more strategic partnerships, greater accountability, and focus on development results—are guiding the preparation process of
the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in lowincome countries Partnership is key among internal
partners to build national consensus—crucial for
sustainabilty—and among external partners to align
support around the country’s strategy. Alignment is
aimed at reducing wasteful competition and overlap
among donors and at promoting learning, selectivity,
transparency, and accountability

The Bank 1s also entering into global partnership
initiatives to address issues at the transnational level
Provision of global public goods requires the joing
of mandates and capabilities of many organizations.
For example, United Nations (U N ) agencies have a
mandate in several key global public goods areas,
such as communicable disease control, while partnership with the IMF 1s central to the Bank’s role in
public goods related to global economic governance,
trade, and financial stability. Partnership with other
institutions, multilateral and bilateral donors, foundations, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs),
and the private sector 1s also crucial. The Bank’s
Strategic Framework for poverty reduction, articulated in fiscal 2001, emphasizes five areas for Bank
support at the global level communicable diseases,

environmental commons, trade and integration,
international financial architecture, and the information and knowledge revolution

INSTITUTIONAL PARTNERS

International Monetary Fund. Collaboration with
the IMF has assumed new vigor Intense partnership
through a Joint Implementation Committee resulted
in substantial progress on debt rehef and PRSPs in
fiscal 2001, the two Boards approved debt relief for
16 countries under the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative and discussed Full or
Inter PRSPs of 32 countries A first-time joint
visit by the heads of the two institutions to Africa,
where the majority of HIPC-PRSP work has been
concentrated, signaled the same high degree of partnership In another area of momentum, 23 countries
participated in the joint Financial Sector Assessment
Program, which flags vulnerabilities in countries’
financial sectors (see also page 57). In line with the
division of labor between the IMF and the Bank—
and with a view to taking better advantage of the
complementarity between the two institutions—each
institution concentrates on its primary areas of
responsibility and competence. The IMF leads the
dialogue with country authorities on macroeconomic
issues, and the Bank, the dialogue on social and
structural issues

United Nations. Bank cooperation with the U N.,
focused on poverty reduction and investment in people, dates back to the inception of the two institutions The international development goals agreed on
at U.N. global conferences in the 1990s as a frame
of reference for that institution's mission underscore
the all-encompassing nature of the Bank-U N partnership. In fiscal 2001 the Bank helped prepare the
General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS,
and the International Conference on Financing for
Development, a major event scheduled for early
2002. Operational collaboration 1s also significant,
for example on HIV/AIDS projects with the Joint
United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS

Partnerships for Development 1102

(UNAIDS), food security proyects with the Food and
Agriculture Organization, and support for PRSP
preparation with other agencies. A U.N. agency
internal learning group meets regularly with the
Bank on the CDF In the past year Mr Wolfensohn
has also participated in high-level U.N meetings.

Multilateral development banks (MDBs). Also
stronger in recent years has been partnership across
MDBs—the World Bank and the four regional development banks, namely, the African Development
Bank (AfDB), the Asian Development Bank (ADB),
the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), and
the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development. Intensified coordination at all levels
includes regular meetings of MDB presidents, who
in February 2001 agreed on poverty reduction as a
Joint objective and on common development principles echoing those of the CDF A particular challenge for MDBs—often the most important external
partners for poorer countries—is the harmonizing of
pohcies and procedures. Several technical working
groups have been established to work on harmonization and convergence in the way MDBs work To
avoid duplication and enhance effectiveness, the
Bank has signed Memoranda of Understanding with
AfDB and IADB, respectively, while one with ADB 1s
under preparation. A protocol on supporting countres preparing PRSPs was agreed on among MDBs
and the IMF

The European Union (EU). Also strong 1s the
Bank’s partnership with the EU, which accounts for
60 percent of total official development assistance
The EU is a major political player, trading partner,
and source of foreign investment for the developing
world. Cooperation covers support to Central and
East European countries (EU accession), the
Commonwealth of Independent States; Bosnia and
Herzegovina (successfully raising funds for its $5 1
billon economic recovery program); and Kosovo,
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and Balkan
reconstruction through a Joint European
Commission (EC)—World Bank Office for South
East Europe in Brussels The Bank Group has
developed in detail, and expects to sign shortly, a
Framework Agreement with the EC on cofinancing
and trust funds, aimed at streamlining administrative arrangements for a broad range of financial
partnerships in the future. The EC also supports

The World Bank Annual Report 2001

the HIPC Initiative and PRSP Programs, and has
committed to cofinance the new Poverty Reduction
Support Credits and contribute to a new Bank-managed multidonor trust fund on public expenditure
management. Collaboration on global-level issues
extends to the CDF, the Global Environmental
Facihty, the Asia-Europe Meeting Trust Fund, governance, anticorruption, and climate change.

Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), Partnership with the OECD
has strengthened considerably in recent years.
Collaboration with the organization’s Development
Assistance Committee (DAC) has been especially
important DAC provides a forum for OECD members to achieve, as bilateral donors, greater coherence
and convergence in their development programs
DAC members—which together contributed over
$53 billion in bilateral aid in 2000—have significantly strengthened their poverty focus over the past
year (by adopting the DAC Guidelines on Poverty
Reduction). In addition, they have expressed an
intention to align aid programs within the PRSP
framework and to untie their aid to least-developed
countries Beyond low-income countries, the Bank
collaborates with OECD on a broad agenda including trade, environment, corporate governance, anticorruption, and the digital divide Objectives are to
minimize duplication of effort, maximize synergies,
and learn from each other.

THEMATIC PARTNERSHIPS

Communicable diseases. With three million people
a year lost to AIDS, two million to tuberculosis, and
over a million to malana, partnerships to control the
mounting threat to development from communicable
diseases have assumed a heightened urgency As
HIV/AIDS continues to spread, global collaboration
becomes imperative (box 6 1). The Bank has also
been partnering with affected countries, the World
Health Organization (WHO), bilateral donors, and
NGOs through the Stop Tuberculosis Initiative, to
mobilize over $125 million toward research for new
drugs and vaccines and expanded access to existing
drugs Another important initiative is Roll Back
Malaria, an Afmican-led initiative launched by the
Bank, WHO, the United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF), and the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) in 1998 to help mobilizeresources for the fight against malaria. An important
public-private partnership is the Global Alliance for
Vaccines and Immunization, already improving access
to existing childhood vaccines while accelerating the
development of new ones.

Child labor. The International Labour Organisation,
UNICEF, and the World Bank have recently
launched a Cooperative Research Program in the
campaign against child labor. Under this effort the
Developing New Strategies for Understanding
Children’s Work and Its Impact Project aims to
improve child labor data collection and analysis and
to help developing countries design appropriate
interventions. This project allows the three agencies
to collaborate at the technical level to address issues
of common concern and to exploit each agency's
comparative advantage in order to provide sound
advice to countries in the area of child labor.

Trade. Particularly with globalization, partnerships
to help developing countries create—and take
advantage of—new trade opportunities are becoming
crucial. The Bank has been working with many multilateral and bilateral agencies (the World Trade
Organization, IMF, the International Trade Center,
UNDP, and the U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development) under the Integrated Framework (IF)
Program created in 1996 to enhance trade-related
technical assistance to developing countries. The IF
has recently been redefined to ensure better integration of trade with national development strategies.
In addition, the Bank engages in a regular dialogue
with the International Confederation of Federal
Trade Unions on a wide range of issues, including
Bank economic and social policies, core labor standards, and country-level experience with development programs.

Environment. Partners are vital to helping the Bank
meet its environmental goals and commitments to
global objectives such as reducing hunger (box 6.2).
In fiscal 2001 the Bank teamed up with
Conservation International and the Global Environment Facility to launch a Critical Ecosystems
Partnership Fund. The fund will protect highly
threatened “biodiversity hot-spots,” also helping
poor people whose survival depends on the
biodiversity. Also in fiscal 2001, the World Commission on Dams, initiated by the Bank and the

Box 6.1 Partnership against HIV/AIDS

Only with concerted effort can the world hope to win the fight
against HIV/AIDS. Significant as the outstanding agenda is,
there is reason for hope:

0 More governments than ever before have confronted
HIV/AIDS publicly over the past year, displaying leadership
and commitment, followed by action.

O Global support has grown, with front-page coverage in periodicals, targeted campaigns, more resources, and U.N.
General Assembly and Security Council resolutions on
HIV/AIDS.

CO AU.N. General Assembly Special Session held in June 2001
renewed global commitment to cooperation amid a heightened awareness that funding from all sources needs to
increase substantially for the spread of HIV/AIDS to be
halted by 2015—a goal agreed on at the session, to be incorporated into the Millennium Development Goals.

D Following negotiations with UNAIDS cosponsors — including the
Bank—under the Accelerating Access Initiative, manufacturers
of HIV/AIDS drugs have reduced their prices by 90 percent.

D The Bank is a founding member and supporter, through the
Development Grant Facility, of the International AIDS Vaccine
Initiative (IAVI). IAVI is promoting the development of
HIV/AIDS vaccines for developing countries.

O The Bank has worked with UNAIDS and the International
Partnership Against AIDS in Africa to help several African
countries prepare projects under the $500 million MultiCountry HIV/AIDS Program (seven of these projects were
approved in fiscal 2001). Similar support to Caribbean
nations is benefiting from collaboration with UNAIDS, the Pan
American Health Organization, WHO, and other regional partners. The Bank has also worked closely with the IMF and
UNAIDS to help countries integrate HIV/AIDS support into
HIPC and PRSP Programs.

© The International AIDS Economic Network—a partnership of
the Bank, UNAIDS, the U.S. Agency for International
Development, and the EU—provides data, tools, and analysis
for compassionate, cost-effective responses to the epidemic
to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide.

Box 6.2 Consultative Group on International Agricultural
Research (CGIAR)

Since 1971, the Bank has provided strong support for the
CGIAR—a network of 16 international agricultural research centers that mobilize cutting-edge science to reduce hunger and
poverty in developing countries, improve health, and protect
the environment.

in fiscal 2001 CGIAR developed high-protein, miracle corn to
help prevent malnutrition—winning the Millennium World Food
Prize—and a vaccine for East Coast Fever, with spillover benefits

for malaria and cancer research.

Partnerships for Development 103104

World Conservation Union, launched its landmark
report—Dams and Development. A New Framework
for Decision-Making, the Bank is now working with
its chents to see how the report's findings can be
used to improve performance. Other collaborative
efforts in recent years are helping countries save
forests, better prepare for natural disasters, and
address climate change (see page 21 on the
Prototype Carbon Fund).

Governance. The Bank has, since the mid1990s, given high priority to issues of corruption
and governance, which hurt poor people the
most. Collaboration with MDBs takes place
through a Working Group on Governance and
Anticorruption. Partnership with UNDP complements Bank contributions, close collaboration is promoting efficient use of resources and reducing
unnecessary duplication. The Bank has also been
active in promoting corporate governance, particularly
since the 1997-98 Asian cnsis when weak disclosure
practices and shareholder nghts hurt investors A
Global Corporate Governance Forum in March 2001,
established jointly with the OECD, aims to address
countries’ corporate governance weaknesses, and
thereby improve their investment climate

Private sector. The Bank works closely with public
and private partners on programs supporting private
sector investment and infrastructure Resources contributed by partners are approaching $200 million
annually Programs aim to promote an enabling
environment for private sector development and to
empower poor people through improved delivery of
services, for example, in the area of microfinance
{see box 6.3). In one example, the Digital
Opportunity Task Force—a Group of Eight initiative—aims at bridging the digital divide
Governments, international organizations, the pnvate sector, and nonprofit organizations are working
together to improve regulatory and network readiness, connectivity and access, and human capacity
The Cities Alliance offers another example of joint
commitment, the Alhance’s target of improving the
hving conditions of at least 100 million slumdwellers by 2020 was incorporated in the recently
adopted UN Millennium Declaration. Diverse
issues have attracted a coalition of dynamic partners
around the Clean Air Initiative. The effort in Latin
America has come to be seen as a model in mobshz
The World Bank Annual Report 2001

ing sustainable resources from the private sector,
public sector, and local leadership, with plans for
replication in African, East European, and Asian
cities. Another area of public-private partnership
relates to the World Bank Institute’s (WBI’s) efforts
to develop capacity-building programs linked to
lending operations on HIV/AIDS, where companies
are helping to inventory best practices and programs
toward establishing a platform for knowledge sharing.

Knowledge and information. Combined with information and communications technologies, knowledge is a critical engine for development and for
empowering poor people. Low rates of physical connectivity, inadequate skills, and weak policies
sharply constrain access by poor countries, however.
The Bank 1s working with a variety of partners to
help countries develop appropriate legal and regulatory environments, support education through programs that explicitly focus on global knowledge
linkages (see box 6.4); encourage investment 1n
information infrastructure, and support a network
of global knowledge centers, such as the CGIAR.
The Bank’s development research work increasingly
involves partners, for example through extensive
worldwide consultations in preparation of the World
Development Report (WDR) 2000/2001 and the
World Development Indicators. An important knowledge partnership that in fiscal 2001 became an
independent organization 1s the Global
Development Network (GDN), which hnks
research institutes around the world, now with a
self-governing body including representatives from
all regions as well as the Bank and UNDP, GDN is
helping to foster world-class local knowledge for
world-class local solutions. The WBI also helps further the Bank’s knowledge agenda, working with
many partners to develop and deliver learning matenal, and build knowledge networks. Reliance on
local partners is an important feature of the Bank’s
learning and research efforts.

PARTNERSHIP WITH CIVIL SOCIETY

The Bank deepened its commitment to partnerships
with civil society organizations (CSOs) in fiscal 2001.
In particular, the Bank placed an emphasis on working with a wider spectrum of CSOs, including
ternational development NGOs, foundations, community groups, professional associations, tradeunions, and faith-based organizations. Whether to
protect forests and promote new vaccines through
global partnerships or to help dehver basic social
services through specific regional, country, or local
imitiatives, CSOs have become critical allies in
designing innovative operations, implementing solutions, and monitoring results.

The Bank has been consulting widely with
CSOs for many years. In fiscal 2001, through faceto-face consultations in each of the Bank's six operational Regions as well as via the Internet, the Bank
sought the perspectives of CSOs on a forthcoming
environment strategy and on revisions to its information disclosure policy. The NGO-Bank Committee
agreed in December 2000 to create a new
Bank-Civil Society Global Forum, which would
bring together a cross-section of CSOs seeking dialogue and partnership with the Bank on urgent thematic issues The proposed forum would recognize
the growing role and expertise of civil society in
development and the need to engage a more diverse
set of actors

Box 6.3 The Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest (CGAP)

CGAP is a partnership of the Bank and 27 other donors and
practitioners to help build a robust microfinance industry serving
the world’s poor. CGAP builds badly needed institutional capacity
by providing technical tools, research, training, and advisory
services to microfinance institutions, donor agencies, and
governments. CGAP also invests in microfinance organizations.

In fiscat 2001 CGAP stepped up its poverty focus—in part
by researching microfinance innovations that serve the needs of
the poorest clients—and considerably expanded the scope of
its training hubs tn Africa, Asia, and Europe. It also continued to
build its Microfinance Gateway, an Internet-based platform now
offering interactive online services (such as contracting with
auditors) to thousands of stakeholders worldwide.

Na Precise figures not available

a World Bank Atlas methodology, per capita GNI (gross national income, formerly GNP) figures are in 2000 US dollars

b Countries are eligible for IDA on the basis of (a) relative poverty and (b) lack of creditworthiness The operational cutoff for IDA eligibility for fiscal 2002 1s a
2000 GNI per capita of $885, using Atlas methodology To receive IDA resources, countries also meet tests of performance In exceptional circumstances, IDA.
extends eligibsity temporarily to countries that are above the operational cutoff and are undertaking major adjustment efforts but are not creditworthy for IBRD
lending An exception has been made for small island economies (see footnote c)

¢ During the IDA-12 period (fiscal 2000-02), an exception to the GNI per capita operational cutoff for IDA eligibility ($885 for fiscal 2002) has been made for
some small island economies, which otherwise would have little or no access to Bank Group assistance because they lack creditworthiness For such countries,
IDA funding 1s considered case by case for the financing of projects and adjustment programs designed to strengthen creditworthiness

INTERNATIONAL BANIK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
Supplement to the
THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT
A Summary of Bank Activities
from
July 1, 1958 to January 31, 1959
(This statement has been prepared for the use of the Economic ana Social
Council of the United Nations in connection with the Council's consideration
of the Thirteenth Annual Report of the Bank.)
T=ECRSHIP AND SUBSCRIPTION
Since June 30, the end of the Bank's fiscal year, Spain and Libya have
become members of the Bank. Spain subscribed to 1,000 shares of capital stock
with a total par value of $100 million, and Libya subscribed to 50 shares with
a par value of $5 million.
On January 31, there were 68 members and the total of subscribed capital
was $9,556,500,000.
PROPOSED INCREASE OF BANK'S CAPITAL
In response to a resolution of the Bank's Board of Governors at its Annual
Meeting in New Delhi in October calling on the Executive Directors to consider
the question of enlarging the Bank's resources through an increase in capital,
the Executive Directors submitted their Report to the Governors in December.
The Report recommended a major increase in the Bank's capital in order to
strengthen the Bank's capacity to borrow funds for financing economic develop-
ment in member countries.
The Executive Directors were of the opinion that the proposed increase
should be sufficiently large to avoid the necessity of seeking frequent changes
in the Bank's capital structure in the future, and emphasized that the respon-
sibility for strengthening the Bank's resources should be shared generally by
the members. Accordingly, they recommended that authorized capital should be
increased by 100% from $10 billion to $20 billion, conditional on the actual
subscription of at least $7 billion by September 15, 1959. Each member wishing
to subscribe to the additional capital must subscribe in an amount equal to its
subscription as of January 31, 1959. No cash payments on the new subscriptions
would be made to the Bank as an addition to its lendable funds. The new sub-
scriptions would be left uncalled, and the Report recommended that the Board of
Governors decide that calls shall be made only when needed to meet obligations
arising from the Bank's borrowings and from its guarantees of loans made by other
investors.  The Directors also recommended a further increase of $1 billion, as
a margin of authorized but unsubscribed capital for future members or possible
later individual increases of subscriptions.
Over and above the general 100% increase in members' subscriptions, certain
special additional increases in subscriptions were proposed in the Report for
Canada, Germany and Japan, whose economic strength has grown markedly in the
post-war period.
By February 2, 1959, the Board of Governors had voted unanimously in favor
of a preliminary resolution which approved the recommendations of the Report



and recommended that member countries take such action as might be necessary
to give effect to the proposals. A further vote is required to authorize the
increase and the Governors have until September 1, 1959 to complete this
vote, thus allowing sufficient time for legislative action which is required
in the case of some members.
LENDING ACTIVITIES
Between July 1, 1958 and January 31, 1959, the Bank made 17 loans
totaling the equivalent of $441 million in 12 countries. The loans were made
in Austria, Brazil, Ceylon, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, India, Japan,
Malaya, Peru, South Africa and Sudan. This brought the gross total of Bank
lending to $4,260 million made up of 221 loans in 49 countries and territories.
A F R I C A
UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA
Railway Loan
$25 million 10-year 5-3/4% loan of December 2, 1958 to the
Union of South Africa
The Bank loan was made concurrently with a public offering of $25 million
of South African bonds by an underwriting syndicate in the United States. The
proceeds of the bond issue will be used to meet part of South Africa's general
capital needs, while the Bank loan will help to finance an expanded investment
program of the South African Railways and Harbours Administration.
The Bank has now lent $125.2 million, under five loans, for the Adminis-
trationts expansion program; most of the funds were used for the railways.
Although the capacity of the railways has been greatly increased and they are
now carrying two-thirds more freight than at the end of the war, they have
not been able to meet the demands of the economy. The Government is now
accelerating its already large railway investment program with the objective of
enabling the railways to handle all freight offered by 1962. This involves
completion of a major part of the program four years earlier than was originally
scheduled. The current loan will cover part of the foreign exchange costs of
the program in the two-year period ending March 31, 1960. The work to be
undertaken includes the improvernent of some 410 miles of line, the electrifica-
tion of 640 miles of track, and new construction of 160 miles of branch and
suburban lines. Some 530 locomotives -- electric, diesel and steam -- and a
large quantity of rolling stock, principally freight cars, will also be
purchased.
SUDANT
Transportation Loan
$39 million 20-year 5-3/8% loan of July 21, 1958 to the
Republic of the Sudan
The loan will cover the foreign exchange costs, during 1958-60, of a
development program being carried out by the Sudan Railways. Rail and river
transport services and the facilities of Port Sudan, all operated by the Sudan
Railways, are of crucial importance to the country's economy. Virtually all



- 3 -
freight and passenger traffic moves by rail or river, in some cases by a slow,
complicated and seasonally interrupted combination of the two, and almost all
the country's foreign trade passes through Port Sudan. The port is several
hundred miles from the principal centers of production and consumption, so
that exports and imports must be carried over great distances inland.
To improve railway services, the Sudan Railways are purchasing diesel
electric locomotives and new rolling stock to replace obsolete units and
provide additional capacity, are improving one of the key lines to the port to
accommodate heavier and faster trains, and are building two new railway
extensions into productive zones, now difficult to reach, in the South and
West. At Port Sudan two new cargo berths will be built and equipped to
replace inefficient pontoon moorings. Some of the river craft are also being
dieselized.
A S I A
CEYLON
Electric Power Loan
$7.4 million 20-year 5-3/8% loan of September 17, 1958
to Ceylon
The loan will finance the foreign exchange costscf building a 25,000-
kilowatt thermal electric power plant in the capital city of Colombo and
of extending transmission and distribution facilities. The project forms
part of an integrated power system serving southwestern Ceylon, which is
the center of economic activity and contains nearly half the population.
Power demand in Ceylon has been growing rapidly in recent years, with
pover sales increasing at an average yearly rate of 15S%.  Industries pro-
ducing consumer goods for the domestic market, together with growing urban
centers, account for a large proportion of the demand. MAost of the remainder
comes from the chief export industries -- tea, rubber and coconut. More
hydroelectric capacity is projected for the system serving the southwest;
meanwhile, the new thermal plant will solve the immediate problem of
increasing power supplies and later will supplement hydroelectric facilities
in times of low water supply.
INDIA
Electric Power Loan
$25 million 20-year 5-3/8% loan of July 23, 1958 to India
The loan will help to finance projects which will add 225,000 kilowatts
of thermal generating capacity to the power system of the Damodar Valley
Corporation (DVC).  The DVC was established in 1948 to execute a scheme for
the unified development of the Damodar Valley, the heart of India's heavy
industry. The DVC will use the current loan for the installation of an
additional 75,000 kilowatts of generating capacity at the Bokaro thermal
plant, which was built with the help of a previous Bank loan; for the con-
struction of a new 150,000-kilowatt thermal power station to be adjacent
to the Government's new steel mill now being built at Durgapur; and for
additional transmission facilities.



-
Power from the DVC system is transmitted over a 1,000-mile network
throughout an area extending 125 miles on each side of the Damodar River.
Its chief customers are four large utilities, two state agencies which sell
power for rural and urban electrification in Bihar and Bengal, two railways
and a number of large industries including the Tata Iron & Steel Company,
the Indian Iron & Steel Co.mpany, and the Chittaranjan locomotive works.  By
1962 DVC must increase its generating capacity by about 700,000 kilowatts
if it is to meet the expected demand of this rapidly growing industrial area.
The projects for which this loan was made will partially meet this need
by increasing the capacity of DVC's system to 480,000 kilowatts.
Railway Loan
$85 million 20-year 5-3/4% loan of September 16, 1958 to India
The loan will pay part of the cost of rolling stock, locomotives and
other equipment required for the expansion program of the Indian Railways.
The Railways are by far the most importart form of transport in India, and
carry large volumes of long-haul traffic that highways, river and coastal
shipping do not handle.  Improvement and expansion of the railways has
progressed satisfactorily in the Second Five-Year Plan.
Adjustments in the railway program are continually made to meet needs of
traffic as they develop; during the Plan period, it is now intended to increase
freight capacity of the Railways from 114 million tons annually to 168 million
tons, instead of the 162 million tons previously planned. This increase should
be attained without adding substantially to the original cost estimates of the
railway program in the Second Five Year Plan and with an actual reduction in
the foreign exchange costs.  This will be achieved by improved operating
efficiency and the postponement of certain less essential parts of the railway
program.
JAPAN
Loans for Steel Production
Since July 1 the Bank has made three loans to increase steel production
in Japan. The loans were made to the Japan Development Bank which is re-
lending the proceeds to privately-owned companies.  These companies are among
the six largest steel producers in Japan and, like the rest of the Japanese
iron and steel industry, are modernizing and expanding their plants to meet
the increasing demand for steel products.  By increasing crude iron and steel-
producing capacity the industry will reduce its dependence on imported scrap,
while the modernization of facilities will improve efficiency and reduce
production costs.
$33 million 15-year 5-3/8% loan of July 11, 1958 to Japan
Development Bank for the Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd.
This loan is helping to finance work being undertaken to expand iron and
steel production at Sumitomo's Wakayama plant in central Honshu. The project
includes constructionof-harbor installations, a-blast furnace, 57 c6ke
ovens and a by-products plant, the remodeling of three open-hearth furnaces,
a blooming mill and auxiliary facilities for all these plants. The project



-5 -
is part of a program being carried out by Sumitomo to increase its annual
productive capacity to about 825,000 tons of pig iron, 1,450,000 tons of
steel ingots and 1,334,000 tons of finished and semi-finished steel products.
$10 million 15-year 5-3/8% loan of August 18, 1958 to
Japan Development Bank for the Kobe Steel Works
In 1957 the Kobe Steel Works began a three-year construction program
designed to increase its annual productive capacity of steel ingots to
about 700,000 tons and of saleable steel products to about 600,000 tons,
as well as to raise its non-ferrous metal and machine-making capacity.
The project for which the Bank's loan was made will help to finance the most
important feature of the program: the construction of a new blast furnace
and related facilities at Nadahama, about 1 miles from the Company's main
steel plant at Kobe. The furnace will have an output of 288,000 tons of
pig iron a year, and will provide the Kobe Company with its own source of
pig iron. The project also includes the construction of harbor installa-
tions at Nadahama, unloading and yard facilities for iron ore and coke,
a sintering plant and a power plant. Bank funds will also help to finance
the remodeling of open hearth furnaces at the Kobe plant and a new mixer there
to receive pig iron from Nadahama.
$22 million 15-year 5-3/4% loan of September 10, 1958 to Japan
Development Bank for the Japan Steel and Tube Corporation Ltd.
This loan will cover the cost of imported equipment for the construction
of new strip mills and related facilities, and for the expansion of a seam-
less tube mill at the Corporation's Mizue steel works near Tokyo. The new
strip mills will replace obsolete equipment and will enable the Corporation
to produce higher quality products at lower cost. The seamless tube mill
being expanded was built with the assistance of an earlier Bank loan. The
project is part of a four-year program which the Corporation began in 1957
to increase its output of pig iron from 1,125,000 to about 1,500,000 tons
and of ingot steel from 1,700,000 to about 2,300,000 tons, with a corres-
ponding expansion of finishing facilities.
Electric Power Loan
$29 million 25-year 5-3/4% loan of September 10, 1958 to
Japan Development Bank for the Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc.
The loan will help to finance the construction on the Ohi River in
Honshu Island of two new hydroelectric power stations having a combined
generating capacity of 170,000 kilowatts. The area served by the Chubu
Power Company encompasses -mid-eastern Honshu and its chief industrial city,
Nagoya. The Nagoya area has long been one of the most important industrial
regions in Japan. In the past five years many new industries have moved
into the area and existing industries have expanded. The demand for power
from the Chubu system has shown an average yearly increase of between 11 and
12%, as against the national average of 8 to 9%. In 1957 the Chubu company
undertook an expansion program designed to add 1,600,000 kilowatts of new
capacity to its system by 1964. The project for which this loan was made is
part of the program and has been given first priority among the new power
facilities being built by the company.

FEDERATION OF MALAYA
Electric Power Loan
$35.6 million 25-year 5-3/4% loan of September 22, 1958
to the Central Electricity Board
The loan will cover the foreign exchange costs of the first stage of
a scheme to develop the power potential of a group of streams on the
Cameron Highlands Plateau, aLout 100 miles north of the capital, Kuala
Lumpur. The project consists of works to bring together the waters of
four rivers on the Plateau and to use the hydraulic head thus developed
in two power stationsj one to be built with 4,300 kilowatts of capacity
and the other with 75,000 kilowatts.
The Central Electricity Board (CEB), the borrower, operates all
federal power plants and distribution facilities, and regulates electri-
city supplies generally in the Federation. CEB's central network now
supplies Kuala Lumpur and the States of Selangor, Negri Sembilan and
Malacca, an area where power demand has been rising at a rate of about 15%
annually, due largely to the expansion of commerce and industry. When com-
pleted, the Cameron Highlands project will increase the capacity of CEB's
network by about 50%, which will enable CEB to satisfy the demand of its
present service area and also to extend the network to other areas.
E U R O P E
AUSTRIA
Power Loan
$25 million 25-year 5-3/4% loan of December 2, 1958 to the
Verbundgesellschaft and Donaukraftwerke as co-borrowers
The Bank loan was made simultaneously with a public offering of $25
million of Austrian bonds by an investment banking group in the United
States. The Austrian Government will lend about half the proceeds of the
bond issue to the two corporations which received the Bank loan; the
remainder will be applied toward financing capital expenditure programs
of the Republic.
The Verbundgesellschaft is a government corporation which operates
most of Austria's transmission system and controls the operations of four
public power generating companies, of which the Donaukraftwerke is one.
The Verbundgesellschaft and its affiliated companies are engaged in a
construction program which will add 1,097,000 kilowatts of new capacity
by the end of 1963. The Aschach project, for which this loan was made,
is the largest undertaking in the program. It will be a run-of-the-
river hydroelectric project on the Danube about 19 miles from the city of
Linz. Units having a total capacity of 264,000 kilowatts will be installed
in the powerhouse, and a 21-mile transmission line will be built to connect
the Aschach plant with the Verbundgesellschaft network.

WEST ER N  HEM IS P HERE
BRAZIL
El'ectric Power Loan
$73 million 25-year 5-3/4% loan of October 3, 1958 to
Central Eletrica de Furnas, S.A.
The loan will cover the foreign exchange costs of building the first
stage of the Furnas project, the largest hydroelectric power installation
ever undertaken in Latin America. The project will be located at Furnas
Rapids on the Rio Grande, 200 miles north of Sao Paulo. In the first stage,
to be completed by mid-1963, the power plant will be installed with 460,000
kilowatts of generating capacity. Since this power is likely to be needed
at once, it is planned that the second stage, under which capacity will
be expanded to 1,100,000 kilowatts, will follow quickly and be completed by
1965. The completed project will bring an increase equal to 50% of the
capacity now available in south central Brazil, where four-fifths of Brazil's
industry and much of its agricultural activity is concentrated.
The Furnas project is the first in which private companies have joined
with official Brazilian agencies to carry out a large power development.
The Central Eletrica de Furnas, which was formed to construct, own and
operate the new power plant, is a joint enterprise of government-owned
and private power companies. All power from the plant will be sold in
bulk to private and public suppliers serving the States of Minas Gerais and
Sao Paulo and the Federal District if Rio de Janeiro.
COLOMBTA
Electric Power Loans
$2.8 million 20-year 5-3/4% loan of December 15, 1958 to the
Central Hidroelectrica del Rio Anchicaya, Limitada (CHIDRAL)
The loan will help to finance facilities to increase the supply of
electric power in Cali, the main city of the Cauca Valley and one of Colombia's
most important industrial cities. With the help of two earlier Bank loans,
CHIDRAL has increased the supply of power in the Cali area sixfold in the
past three years. However, because of population growth and rapid indus-
trialization, there is a continuing need for more electricity. The earlier
loans helped toward the construction of a hydroelectric plant on the Anchicaya
River and of a steam plant at Yumbo near Cali. The current loan will be used
for the installation of a second 10,000-kilowatt unit at Yumbo, for improve-
ment of the distribution system in Cali and for the purchase of dredging equip-
ment for the Anchicaya Reservoir.
$4.6 million 20-year 5-3/4% loan of January 30, 1959 to the
Central Hidroelectrica de Caldas, Ltda. (CHEC)
This loan is for a project to increase the supply of power to Manizales,
the center of Colombia's coffee trade, and to neighboring towns. The 26,000-
kilowatt La Esmeralda power plant to be builtu as part of the project is the
second stage in the development of the Chinchina and Campoalegre rivers in the
Department of Caldas; the first, carried out with the help of an earlier Bank



- 8 -
loan, was the construction of the 16,000-kilowatt La Insula plant.  The second
stage also includes the construction of 76 miles of transmission lines which
will enable CHEC to extend its services to 19 additional towns. In 13 of the
towns, CHEC will acquire the distribution systems, which it will rehabilitate
and operate. The power from the new plant will more than double present capa-
city in the Manizales area, where industrial and commercial growth has been
hampered by a shortage of electricity.
ECUADOR
Port Loan.
$13 million 25-year 5-3/4% loan of October 9, 1958 to the
Guayaquil Port Authority
The loan was made for the construction of a new port at Guayaquil,
Ecuador's largest city and main port. At present Guayaquil has no docking
facilities; small vessels that can come up the Guayas River have to anchor
midstream and use lighters for loading and unloading and larger ships have
to anchor near the mouth of the river and transport their cargo by lighter
some 40 miles to Guayaquil.
The new port will be located six miles from Guayaquil at the head of
the Estero Salado, a salt-water arm of the Gulf of Guayaquil. A new concrete
wharf 3,000 feet long, with a 35-foot depth of water at low tide, will be
built to accommodate five ships at a time, and transit sheds and other
buildings will be erected behind the w'harf on land which will be reclaimed.
A barge canal about a mile long will connect the Estero Salado with the
Guayas River, and a four-lane highway, already under construction, will link
the new port with the city.
The new port will be able to accommodate large ocean-going vessels and
on the basis of present traffic alone, it is estimated that handling charges
will be reduced by the equivalent of more than $500,000 annually. The
reduction in turn-around time of vessels will result in a further annual
saving of about $1.5 million.
EL SALVADOR
Road Loan
$5 million 15-year 5-3/4% loan of January 7, 1959 to El Salvador
The loan was made for the construction of 21 feeder roads which will
form part of an all-weather road network throughout the Pacific coastal plain
of El Salvador, and for additional work on the Coastal Highway, the main
artery of the system. The feeder roads will have a total length of 230 miles
and many of them will replace existing tracks and earth roads which in the
rainy season are passable only by ox-cart. The Coastal Highway, now under
construction, is being partly financed by an earlier Bank loan.
The Pacific coastal plain is suitable for crop cultivation, livestock
raising and dairy farming, and much of it has been inaccessible. The road
network now being built will greatly improve communications in the southern
half of El Salvador and will open up the region to denser settlement and
more intensive cultivation.



- 9-
PERU
Port Loan
$6, 575,000 20-year 5-3/4% loan of September 17, 1958
to the Port of Callao Authority
The loan will help to finance expansion and improvement of the Port of
Callao, which handles about 60% of Peru's foreign trade and a considerable
volume of coastal traffic. The improvements to be undertaken consist mainly
of a new petroleum pier; a new berth equipped with mineral loading plant to
move up to 14,000 tons daily, compared with the present loading rate of
between 500 and 850 tons; two new general cargo berths; new storage sheds
and maintenance shops; and the acquisition of tugs and a dredge. The new
facilities will provide better accommodation and service for ships calling
at Callao. This should improve the competitive position of Peruvian
products, and particularly of important mineral exports, in world markets.
SURVEY MISSIONS
Libya
A general survey mission organized by the Bank at the request of the
Government arrived in Libya in late January for a stay of about two months.
The mission will appraise Libya's economic situation and potentialities and
propose objectives which Libya can expect to achieve in economic development
over the next five years or so and recommend specific and practical measures
for reaching these objectives. The 11-man mission includes economists and
advisers on agriculture, water resources, transportation, communications and
public utilities, industry, education and public health. The Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, World Health Organization
and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization pro-
vided assistance to the Bank in connection with the recruitment and briefing
of the mission members.
Peru
The agricultural survey mission, sponsored jointly by the Bank and
FAO, completed its studies in Peru in September 1958. The report of the
mission, which contains recommendations for a comprehensive agricultural
program for Peru, was informally presented to the Government for comment in
January 1959.
Tanganyika
In January 1959 the Bank completed the organization of a general survey
mission to Tanganyika which had been requested by the Governments of the United
Kingdom and of Tanganyika. The mission is scheduled to arrive in Tanganyika
in early June 1959.
Thailand
The report of the general survey mission, which spent the fiscal year
1957-58 in Thailand, was informally presented to the Government for comment
in December 1958.

Earnings and Reserves
Net earnings in the seven months ending January 31, 1959 amounted to
$25 million, all of which was credited to the Supplemental Reserve against
losses on loans and guarantees.  In addition, the Bank's Special Reserve
grew by $13.5 million during that period.  On January 31, 1959 the total
of these reserves amounted to $388 million.
Funded Debt
The funded debt of the Bank was increased by a net amount of $194 million
during the seven-month period, bringing the total outstanding funded debt of
the Bank to the equivalent of $1,852 million on January 31.
In this period new bond issues and private placements of Bank obliga-
tions amounted to the equivalent of $344 million.  These consisted of a public
issue of $100 million of bonds, part of which is subject to delayed delivery;
and five private placements of obligations totaling the equivalent of $244
million, including $47.6 million in Deutsche Marks some of which still remain
to be drawn down by the Bank.  Outstanding debt was increased a further $25
million as a result of the delivery of bonds of five earlier issues, which
had been subject to delayed d.elivery arrangements.  Repayment of debt through
bond maturities and regular purchase fund and sinking fund transactions
amounted to $152 million.
Sales of Borrowers' Obligations and Joint Operations
Private investors participated directly in 14 of the 17 loans that were
made between July 1, 1958 and January 31, 1959, and two loans -- those to
Austria and South Africa -- were made simultaneously with a public offering
of the country's bonds on the United States investment market. The direct
participations amounted to the equivalent of $11.4 Imillion and took place
in connection with loans in Ceylon, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, India,
Japan, Malaya, Peru, South Africa and Sudan. In all cases the participations
were undertaken without the guarantee of the Bank.
Including these participations, the Bank sold or agreed to sell the
equivalent of $55 million principal amounts of loans between July 1, 1958
and January 31, 1959. At January 31, the total amount of such sales was
$475 million, of which all but $69 million were sold without the Bank's
guarantee.
AN NU AL  MEET ING
The 1959 Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors will convene in
Washington, D.C. on September 28, 1959.

FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
WASHINGTON, D. C.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements and related notes present
fairly, in terms of United States currency, the financial position of International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development at June 30, 1958, and the results of
its operations for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding
year. Our examination of these statements was made in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the account-
ing records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary.

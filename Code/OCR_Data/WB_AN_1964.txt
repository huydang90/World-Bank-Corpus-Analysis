* The year’s 18 IDA Credits were made in 8 countries and territories, andHE WORLD BANK GROUP OF INSTITU
TIONS has sought to attack the stubborn
problems of economic devclopment on a number
of fronts: providing finance in increasingly flexible ways, furnishing technical and planning assistance to member countries, building up local
institutions to mobilize and channel capital for
productive purposes, and forming international
consultative groups to coordinate the provision
of external aid. On all these fronts the Bank and
its affiliates have continued to broaden and intensify their efforts during the year just past. For
the second year in the history of the group, its
loans, credits and investments exceeded $1,000
million: World Bank loans and investments by
the International Finance Corporation (described in IFC’s own Annual Report) were near
previous maximums; development credits from
the International Development Association
reached a record total.

The Bank’s financial strength continued to
grow; its reserves reached more than $845
million. The Executive Directors initiated steps
which in future would free more of the Bank’s
income for use in its operations, and made proposals intended to enlarge still further the usefulness of IFC and IDA. In the case of IFC, the
proposal was to amend the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and IFC so as to authorize
Bank lending to IFC. In the case of IDA, the
proposal was that the Governors approve the
transfer to IDA of $50 million of the Bank’s net
income for the fiscal year. In the meantime, a
group of IDA’s member governments took action to assure that their own contributions to the
replenishment of IDA’s resources would become
effective.

The Bank made its first loans in eight countries:
China, Liberia, Malta, Mauritius, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain and Tunisia; there were
four new borrowers from IDA: Ecuador, Niger,
Syria and Tanganyika; and IFC made its first
commitments in Honduras, Malaysia, Nigeria,
Sudan and Turkey. Altogether, projects in 80

countries have now received financial assistance
from the Bank and its affiliates.

The Bank group supported projects of new
kinds in a number of the commitments they
undertook during the year. The Bank made a
loan (in Algeria) for the first large-scale commercial plant for the liquefaction of natural gas;
it provided funds for a sea water distillation
plant as part of a loan to Malta. Vor the first
time, IDA extended a credit for a range of important capital goods manufacturing industries
{in India); it made its second credit for the expansion of education (in Tanganyika), soon followed by a third and fourth (both in Pakistan).

It was a highly active year for the Bank and
IDA; but it was also an introspective year. The
President and the Executive Directors began a
thoroughgoing review of the policies and practices of the two institutions. It resulted, among
other things, in a resolve that the institutions
should try to increase the effectiveness of their
activities in agriculture, industry and education.

AGRICULTURE: Post-war experience has
shown that progress in agriculture is essential to
economic development. Agriculture is the chief
economic activity in almost all of the underdeveloped countries; a high proportion of their
employment is generated in this sector, and export earnings in a number of countries are almost entirely dependent on it. An unduly slow
increase in agricultural output and income imposes severe constraint on the growth of the
economy as a whole. But the best available information indicates that agricultural output in
the developing countries has done little more
than keep pace with population growth in the
last decade; and for some underdeveloped countries, the cost of importing food is a heavy burden
on the balance of payments. Clearly, the stimulation and guidance of more rapid improvements
in agricultural techniques and organization constitute a key to the achievement of a satisfactory
rate of development.Bank Loans and IDA Credits 1963/64 by Area

15% of IDA’s are for agricultural and forestry
projects, mainly for irrigation and flood control.
In addition, there are many transportation projects which benefit agriculture by improving
access to markets. Nevertheless, the Bank and
IDA are convinced of the need to broaden and
intensify stiil further their activities in support of
agriculture.

In the year just past, the amount of Bank and
IDA lending for agricultural projects, while not
large, compared favorably with that of previous
years, and included a variety of unusual undertakings: The Bank made a loan in the Republic
of China for the purchase of fishing vessels, and
lent in Chile for the improvement of pastureland
and the acquisition of breeding stock. IDA lent
for livestock production in Paraguay and to
strengthen an agricultural credit institution in
Jordan. The Bank and IDA are hopeful that
their assistance to agricultural credit institutions
can be extended; these institutions should become progressively more important channels for
other international sources of funds as well, and
can serve as focal points for a wide range of
domestic measures to raise agricultural production. By combining technica! advice and supervision with the provision of finance, they can
often greatly enhance the effectiveness of both.

Agricultural projects, especially those designed
to have a broad impact, present especially difficult problems of organization and direction, and
generally require a long gestation period. Indeed,
the critical bottleneck in development of the
agricultural sector continues to be the dearth of
adequately studied, economically promising projects. As one method of attacking this problem,
the Bank has negotiated an agreement, on behalf of itself and IDA, with the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization to initiate a
jointly financed cooperative program to improve
the quality and increase the number of proposals
for agricultural financing. Under the agreement,
the institutions would work together in the identification and preparation of projects for potential
financing and in appraising such projects; if the
Bank or IDA then agreed to finance them, the
organizations would cooperate in supervising
their execution and operation, and in arranging
necessary technical assistance. The agreement,

already approved by the Governors of the Bank
and IDA, will be acted on by the Governing
Council of FAO in October 1964. Meanwhile,
pending such approval, the two organizations
already have begun informal cooperation in line
with the agreement. During the year, in addition, a mission organized by the Bank began field
work on a long-range study of the problems of
agriculture in Africa south of the Sahara.

INDUSTRY: The relatively rapid growth of
industry in the underdeveloped countries is a
favorable aspect of their development, and the
Bank, IDA and IFC believe that they can give
additional encouragement to this sector. During
the year, IFC and the Bank continued their support of industrial development finance companies, and committed more than $50 million to
create or strengthen companies of this kind. The
industrial financing activities of the World Bank
group as a whole continued at a high level,
amounting during the fiscal year to more than
$180 million in all. IDA extended an industrial
credit of a new kind: It was not extended for a
new project, but was made to help manufacturers in selected Indian capital goods industries
to make fuller use of already existing capacity, by enabling them to import components
and materials on a scale not possible up to now
because of a scarcity of foreign exchange.

Soon after the end of the fiscal year, the
Executive Directors made a recommendation to
the Governors which, if adopted, would create
the possibility of a still greater flow of capital
from the World Bank group to industry. Under
the recommendation, the Articles of Agreement
of both the Bank and IFC would be amended
to enable the Bank, under appropriate limitations, to make loans to IFC, as it does to private
development finance companies, for re-lending
to private companies.

World Bank loans to private companies require a government guarantee of repayment; but
frequently private enterprises are reluctant to
seek such guarantees, and many governments
find it politically or constitutionally difficult to
extend them. IFC, on the other hand, does not
seek or accept government guarantees. Loans
from the Bank to IFC, therefore, would provide
additional resources for the financing of privateindustry without the need of a host government
guarantee, Bank loans would enable IFC to
make larger commitments than its present resources allow it to do, and would provide it with
funds so that, in appropriate cases, it could finance enterprises with fixed-interest loans not
carrying equity or other special features.

EDUCATION: It is generally recognized that
economic growth in all sectors requires an adequate supply of basic skills at every level of
activity, from the effective use of planning techniques in business and government to the proper
use of tools in workshops and on farms. Education, therefore, is basic to economic development.
This hardly requires illustration, but it is well
exemplified in an objective of IDA’s two credits
for education in Pakistan during the year: They
will help not only in the direct training of
agricultural experts, but will also prepare
teachers to train experts.

IDA now intends to increase its support for
educational projects, and the Bank also is prepared, in appropriate circumstances, to enter
the field. Both institutions, however, will currently limit their operations to projects in technical education (at all levels) and sometimes
general secondary education of high priority in
terms of economic development. To identify and
prepare such projects, they afe working in
cooperation with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
under a cost-sharing agreement formally approved in June 1964. In 1963, Unesco sent
educational investment programing missions to
five countries, and others are now being prepared
within the framework of the cooperative program. The purpose of the forthcoming missions
is to help in the choice and preparation of projects as a basis for requests to the Bank and IDA
for financial and technical assistance. Where
Bank or IDA financing results, Unesco’s help
may be enlisted in supervising the execution of
projects and in providing technical assistance.

LOCAL EXPENDITURE FINANCING: Experience has demonstrated the need in all economic
sectors for the provision of external finance for
local expenditure. Having reviewed past practice, the Executive Directors have confirmed the
principle that the Bank and IDA should be pre
pared to provide finance for local expenditure
on high-priority projects in cases where lending
only funds needed for direct imports would not
provide adequate support.

THE NEW INITIATIVES undertaken during
the year, however, do not mean that the Bank
and IDA are changing the basic directions of
their activity. They will continue to be concerned primarily with basic projects, especially
in the fields of transportation and electric power,
which require large amounts of capital and have
a broad impact throughout the economy. More
than half of Bank and IDA transactions during
the year were for projects of this kind, and more
than 70% of the money lent was for infrastructure. (See Table on page 9.)

RISING LEVELS OF DEBT and of debt service
payments are a normal accompaniment of the
process of development. For many countries,
however, debt service has risen much faster than
earnings from exports; and some countries have
assumed obligations which, although not necessarily excessive in total amount, are concentrated
too heavily in the short term.

The heavy debt burden that weighs on an increasing number of its member countries has
been a continuing concern of the World Bank
group. This concern has been expressed at meetings of consortia and consultative groups of
capital-exporting countries, chaired by the Bank,
at which amounts and terms of aid to the developing countries have been discussed. There
are two consortia, dealing with assistance to
India and Pakistan; the consultative groups are
concerned with Colombia, Nigeria, the Sudan
and Tunisia. In these meetings, the Bank was
gratified to note a continuing trend during the
year toward more appropriate terms of financing. Also, the Executive Directors have decided
that the Bank itself may vary some terms of its
lending to lighten the service burden in cases
where this is appropriate to the project and to
the debt position of the country. It may, for
instance, agree to an extended grace period, as
it did in a road loan made to Liberia in January
1964; or it may set a longer term, as it did in
February 1964 for a 35-year loan made in
Colombia for the big Nare power project.Bank Loans and IDA Credits 1963/64 by Purpose

The World Bank group’s chief means of helping to alleviate the problems of debt service,
however, are the long-term, low-cost credits
extended by IDA, and the replenishment of
IDA’s resources was assured by action of member
governments during the year. In 1963, the
Executive Directors had proposed that IDA’s
resources be increased by $750 million of contributions from 17 governments, including
$8,625,000 in the form of initial subscriptions by
Belgium and Luxembourg, which had indicated
their intention of joining IDA. At the same time,
it was proposed that no country’s agreement to
contribute would become binding until 12
countries with prospective contributions of at
least $600 million had formally notified IDA
that they would provide the amounts proposed
for them. This condition was met on June 29,
1964. As the fiscal year ended, the remaining
five governments were in the process of completing action required for their participation in the
replenishment. The new contributions will be
available for commitment in development credits
until at least June 30, 1966, and payment is to
be made in three equal installments beginning
in November 1965, one year after the final payment on subscriptions to IDA’s initial resources.

The 17 governments expected to assist in the
replenishment of IDA’s resources, together with
their proposed contributions, are as follows:

The Government of Kuwait also has decided
to participate in the replenishment of IDA resources, with a contribution of $3.36 million.
This will bring the total of replenishment resources to $753.36 million. Another commitment
in favor of LDA was undertaken by the Government of Sweden, which, over and above its
participation in the general replenishment of
IDA resources, offered to make its third special
supplementary contribution, amounting to
$5,045,000 in convertible kronor,

The Executive Directors have recommended
to the Governors that the Bank itself become an
important contributor to IDA’s resources. In a
report to be considered by the Governors at their
Annual Meeting in September 1964, they propose that the Bank transfer as a grant to IDA
the amount of $50 million—the balance of the
Bank’s net income for 1963/64 remaining after
the allocation of $47 million to the Supplemental Reserve, and thus available for distribution as a dividend or for other disposition (sce
page 17).

THE BANK CONTINUES TO PLACE A HIGH
VALUE on soundly conceived national development programs which can serve as frameworks
for investment and for the evolution of policy
and administrative measures conducive to economic development. As detailed later in this
Report (see page 17), it is continuing to assist its
member countries to formulate development
programs. In some cases, this assistance is given
by general survey missions which make an inventory of a country’s economic resources,
analyze its needs and problems, and sketch the
general lines of a development program. In
others, the Bank provides resident advisers to
help the planning authorities.

The usefulness of development planning by
now is generally recognized, and hardly any developing country is without a plan. National

The Island Bend Dam is one of nine large
dams being built in the Snowy Mountains
scheme for producing electric power and
providing irrigation water in southeastern
Australia. The Bank made a loan of

$100 million for the scheme in 1962.12

planning, however, has run ahead of the preparation of projects, and in many underdeveloped
countries, there is still a shortage of well conceived and well prepared high priority projects
available for financing. The shortage is critical,
for neither general plans nor supplies of capital
will accomplish much until the right techniques,
competent management. and manpower with
the proper blend of skills are brought together
and focused effectively on projects of high economic value. The need, moreover, is urgent, for
the failure to set projects in motion today will
handicap development far into the future.

To help remedy the lack of project planning,
the Bank is taking and intensifying measures to
assist its members in the preparation of projects,
apart from the arrangements with Unesco and
FAO already mentioned. In appropriate cases,
the Bank finds the necessary experts, draws up
an outline of work and pays the foreign exchange
costs of studies designed to produce viable projects of high economic priority; it also plays a
similar supervisory role in cases where it acts as
Executing Agency for studies financed by the
United Nations Special Fund (see page 17).

The work of the Bank’s Economic Development Institute to improve the quality of projects also continues to expand. This year, EDI
gave its first project evaluation course in Spanish,
for participants from 16 countries, and conducted
its first course to be concerned primarily with the
evaluation of industrial projects, attended by
participants from 19 countries. In cooperation
with the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, EDI also has arranged for a course in
project evaluation to be held in Jaipur, India,
for participants from eight Asian countries.

THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND STAFF
of the Bank continued work on the proposal to
establish a center for the conciliation or arbitration of investment disputes arising between foreign investors and governments.

During the year, the proposal was given the
form ofa preliminary draft Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of Other States. The draft was considered at four regional consultative meetings of
legal experts, held in Addis Ababa, Bangkok,
Geneva and Santiago and attended by experts

designated by 86 governments in all. The Executive Directors are now examining the results of
the regional meetings in order to determine what
further steps should be taken toward preparing a
final text of a Convention for consideration by
governments.

The Convention would make facilities available to which foreign investors and governments
could have access on a voluntary basis for the
settlement of investment disputes through conciliation, arbitration, or conciliation followed by
arbitration. The Convention would provide a
mechanism for the selection of conciliation commissions and arbitral tribunals and for the conduct of the proceedings.

The initiative for such proceedings might come
either from a State or from an investor. But no
State by the mere fact of accepting the Convention would be bound to resort to the facilities of
the Conciliation and Arbitration Center, and no
foreign investor could initiate proceedings against
a signatory State unless both had previously
agreed to have recourse to the Center. Once
they had so agreed, however, both parties would
be irrevocably bound to carry out their undertaking. The heart of the Convention, in fact, is
the assurance which it provides that if the parties
agree to resort to the facilities available under it,
their agreement wil! be given full effect. This, it
is hoped, will create an element of mutual confidence that, in time, will contribute to a healthier
investment climate and a larger flow of international private investment.

AN EVENT OF OUTSTANDING SIGNIFICANCE
for the international development effort was the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in the spring of 1964. In twelve
weeks of deliberations it ranged over the whole
panorama of issues relating both to international
trade and to the financing of economic development.

The President of the World Bank group addressed the Conference, and the Bank and IDA
were represented throughout the proceedings.
The President transmitted to the Conference a
report on ‘Trade, Development and the World
Bank Group”; and two Bank staff studies—
“Economic Growth and External Debt” and
“The Commodity Problem’’—were prepared forthe Conference as background for its deliberations.

At the request of the Conference, the Bank
agreed to undertake several studies of problems
and proposals in the field of development finance:
of a plan by which increased funds for development would be raised in private capital markets
and lent to the developing countries at long term
and low interest, with the governments of the
developed countries guaranteeing the borrowing operations and subsidizing the difference
between the cost of borrowing and the loan
charges; of the feasibility of establishing a system, administered by IDA but with funds supplementary to its own, for assisting countries whose
development programs are threatened by a decline in export earnings below reasonable expectations, due to long-term factors beyond their
control ; of the use and terms of suppliers’ credits,
and of possible ways of financing exports from
developing countries; and of multilateral investment insurance. The Bank’s undertaking these
studies implies no conclusion about the merits of
the specific proposals involved.

THE BANK CONTINUED during the year its
studies of the prospects for the principal commodities moving in world trade, which are so
crucial to the investment and growth potential
of the less developed countries. It made available
to the International Cotton Advisory Committee
a study of prospects for extra-long staple cotton.
In addition, at the initiative of the International
Coffee Council, the Bank agreed to take part
with the Council and the Food and Agriculture
Organization in a long-range study of the coffee
problem, directed in part to seeking alternative
production and investment opportunities for the
countries concerned.

Some developing countries face difficulties in
mobilizing local capital for productive invest
High-grade manganese ore is an important

ment partly because of investor fears of inflation.
The Bank has begun an examination of this
problem, and is studying the feasibility of measures that might be taken to assist in creating and
maintaining domestic markets for bonds issued
by the governments of less developed countries
in their own currencies.

THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE BANK continued to
rise rapidly during the year. Seventeen countries
joined, including 16 in Africa, bringing total
membership to 102. Several members increased
their capital subscriptions to the Bank: Ecuador
from $12.8 million to $17.1 million, El Salvador
from $6 million to $10.7 million, Israel from
$33.3 million to $66.6 million, and the Syrian
Arab Republic from $20 million to $33.3 million.
At June 30, the subscribed capital of the Bank
was $21,186 million. To enable the Bank to
accept additional capital subscriptions, authorized capital had been increased on December 31,
1963, to $22,000 million.

New Members

The membership of IDA also rose by 17, to 93.
Including subscriptions of new members, initial
subscriptions to IDA rose to $987,445,000. A list
of new members of the Bank and IDA, together
with their subscriptions, is given below.

THE REGULAR STAFF of the Bank and IDA
grew during the year to a total of 975. The
number of nationalities included was 62.

Mr. Orvis A. Schmidt was appointed to be
Special Adviser to the President, on matters
concerning Latin America; Mr. Gerald Alter
succeeded him as Director of the Department of
Operations, Western Hemisphere. Mr. Bernard
Chadenet, a former Bank staff member and
more recently general manager of a French
group of industrics, was appointed Associate
Director of the Department of Technical Operations. Mr. Dragoslav Avramovic was appointed
Assistant Director of the Economic Department,
and continues in charge of that Department. Mr.
Federico Consolo rejoined the Bank’s staff as

Mr. George Martin, who had been Director
of the Marketing Department since 1950, retired
from the staff; Mr. Howard C. Johnson, who
had been Manager of Portfolio Sales and Participations, was named Director of the New York
Office. Mr. Donald D. Fowler of the staff was
appointed Assistant Secretary.

General R. A. Wheeler retired in February
after 15 years of highly distinguished service. He
had served successively as Engineering Adviser,
the first Director of the Department of Technical
Operations, and consultant. He played a highly
significant role in the development of Bank
policies, and undertook a number of special
assignments of unusual importance. He departs
with the good wishes of his friends in the Bank
and throughout the world.

The first two groups of appointees under
the Junior Professional Recruitment Program
entered the Bank during the fiscal year, and the
third group was appointed. This program brings
young university graduates of outstanding ability
into the career staff through a two-year period
of in-service training, upon completion of which
it is expected that they will be given regular staff
assignments. The 33 appointees average 28
years of age, ranging from 24 to 31, and come
from 20 countries: Argentina, Austria, Belgium,
China, Colombia, Cuba, France, Germany,
Greece, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, Philippines, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey,
the United Kingdom and the United States.

 

The Bank and its affiliates suffered a tragic loss through
the sudden death of Mr. William F. Howell, Director
of Administration, on July 9, 1964. Mr. Howell
joined the Bank in 1946, and was one of its earliest
employees; he had served as Personnel Manager and
Assistant Director of Administration before becoming
Director in 1952. He played a leading role in building
the international staffs of the Bank and its affiliates;
his outstanding professional and personal qualities had
won him universal high regard and warm affection.
He will be sorely missed.

 

The Bank’s Finances

INCOME + Net income reached $97 million and
loan commissions amounted to $33 million.
Both were record figures.

Gross income for the year, excluding loan
commissions, was $219 million, a gain of $15
million over the previous year. Bond and Note
interest and issuance expenses were $103 million,
a decline of $1 million. Administrative costs rose
by $1 million, to $14.6 million. Additional
expenditures, for services to member countries,
amounted to $4.3 million, an increase of about
$1.5 million; the total was spent on comprehensive economic survey missions, project and
sector studies, training programs for officials of
the underdeveloped countries, and other technical and advisory services.

SPECIAL RESERVE » Commissions were added
to the Special Reserve and raised it to $288
million. Funds in this reserve are invested in
short-term government obligations, and can be
used solely to meet the Bank’s obligations arising
from borrowings and from its guaranteeing of
loans.

After duc consideration of the reserve requirements of the Bank, the Executive Directors
concluded that it was no longer necessary to
automatically segregate a substantial portion of
income in a form in which it was not available
for the general operations of the Bank. They
therefore adopted a change in policy affecting
commissions and the Special Reserve. Heretofore, the Bank has treated a portion of its loan
charges, amounting to 1% per annum of outstanding loans held by the Bank, as commission,
and has automatically allocated the proceeds to
the Special Reserve. Effective July 1, 1964, this
practice will be discontinued, with the minor
exception of approximately $87 million of old
loans outstanding at June 30, 1964, for which
the loan agreements state the commission separately or mention “interest (including commission).”” With this exception, the Bank will now
consider all income from loan charges as part of
its regular income; and net income will thereby
be increased by the equivalent of what otherwise
would have automatically gone into the Special
Reserve. The action will not affect the level of

1516

loan charges; nor will it affect the amount of the
Bank’s income which would be available in
future for reserves (either the Special Reserve or
the Supplemental Reserve) whenever such use
of income is thought desirable.

ALLOCATION OF NET INCOME »* From the
fiscal year 1950/51 to 1962/63, the Bank’s net
income was allocated automatically to the Supplemental Reserve Against Losses on Loans and
Guarantees. In September 1963, the Executive
Directors adopted a resolution discontinuing
this automatic allocation, retroactive to July 1,
1963, and the resolution was noted with approval
by the Board of Governors.

During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1964,
net income was credited to Net Income Account,
and on July 30, 1964, the Executive Directors
approved the transfer of $47 million of net income
to the Supplemental Reserve. The addition
raised the Reserve to $605 million. Amounts
corresponding to the Reserve are mingled with
general funds and used in the operations of the
Bank.

The Executive Directors decided that the
financial position of the Bank made it unnecessary to transfer the balance of the year’s net
income to reserves or otherwise retain it in the
Bank’s business; and they have recommended
to the Board of Governors that this balance,
amounting to $50 million, be transferred to the
International Development Association as a
grant. Concurrently, the Directors recommended
the following statement of policy by the Bank:
“Any transfers to the Association will be made
only out of net income which (i) accrued during
the fiscal year in respect of which the transfer
is made and (ii) is not needed for allocation to
reserves or otherwise required to be retained in
the Bank’s business and, accordingly, could
prudently be distributed as dividends.” Both
recommendations will be placed before the
Board of Governors at its Annual Meeting in
September 1964.

DISBURSEMENTS, REPAYMENTS AND SALES
OF LOANS + Total loans (including loans yet to
become effective) held by the Bank at June 30,
net of exchange adjustments, were $5,192 million, a gain of $480 million for the year.

Disbursements amounted to $559 million, as
compared to $620 million in the previous year.

Borrowers repaid $117 million to the Bank
and $150 million to investors holding maturities
of Bank loans. The total of $267 million compared to $244 million of repayments the year
before.

Sales of loan maturities declined from the
$273 million of a year earlier. They amounted
to $173 million, of which $126 million was in
sales from portfolio and $47 million in participations by investors who agreed to take up parts
of Bank loans at the time of the signing of the
loan agreements. In Europe, sales appear to
have been affected by rising yields on other
securities. In the United States, an important
factor was pending legislation which, retroactively to July 19, 1963, would impose an

investors of securities of 22 countries classified
as developed. Although participations in Bank
loans would be exempt, it was decided as a
matter of policy not to sell to investors in the
United States loans made in any of the designated
countries.

With the sale to the Banque de France of
$58.6 million of the loan of 1947 to Credit
National of France, the Bank disposed of all of
its holdings of its first and largest loan. The loan
amounted to $250 million, and the proceeds
were used to help France maintain a flow of

imports essential to its post-war recovery.

LOAN CHARGES + The rate of interest on loans
by the Bank remained unchanged at 514%
throughout the year. Effective from July 1, 1964,
however, the annual commitment charge of 34%
on the undisbursed part of Bank loans will be
reduced to 34%. The reduction will apply to
existing as well as new loans.

FUNDED DEBT + The Bank continued in a
liquid position that made it unnecessary to raise
new money during the year. The funded debt
declined for the second consecutive year; it was
reduced by $27.4 million. An increase of $4.5
million, arising from issuance to investors of
bonds which were sold on a delayed delivery
basis in previous years, was more than offset by
the repayment of $7.8 million of maturing
obligations and by the Bank’s purchase and
redemption of $24.1 million of bonds to meet
purchase fund and sinking fund requirements.

One refunding issue was placed during the
period. It consisted of $100 million of Two-Year
4% U.S. dollar bonds, and was placed entirely
outside the United States, with central banks
and governmental accounts in 29 countries. It
replaced an equal amount of bonds of the same
interest and term, also held entirely outside the
United States, that matured on September 15,
1963.

IDA’s Finances

The amount of new IDA credits approved
during the fiscal year was $283 million, bringing
total IDA commitments on June 30, 1964, to
$778 million. Disbursements during the year

were $124 million, as compared to $56 million in
the previous year. The cumulative total of IDA
disbursements stood at $193 million on June 30,
1964.

Before the action for the replenishment of
IDA resources became effective on June 29,
1964, IDA had committed almost all the resources
which were available to it up to that time,
totaling $782 million. This figure rose to $1,450
million when the replenishment action became
effective for twelve Part I Governments on June
29, 1964, and will rise to $1,540 million with the
completion of the replenishment formalities by
the remaining Part I Governments, including
Kuwait, and with the actual receipt of Sweden’s
third special supplementary contribution (see
page 10). With the completion of these formal
actions, IDA will have available $762 million
for new commitments in the period subsequent
to June 30, 1964.

Technical Assistance

PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS + The Bank’s technical assistance to its member countries continued
to widen both functionally and geographically
during the year. Bank missions were concerned
with advice on national! development programs
in ten countries; the Bank was helping to carry
on a score of studies designed to further the
development of particular economic sectors or to
advance the planning of specific projects; and
help was being given in a growing number of
special assignments. Specific details of the Bank’s
technical assistance are given, for each country
concerned, in the Annex beginning on page 21.

Two teams were at work during the year on
comprehensive economic surveys and recommendations for development programs: the
mission to Morocco finished its field work just
before the cnd of the fiscal year; the mission to
the Territory of Papua and New Guinea also finished its field work, and its report was nearly
completed. Members of the Bank staff served as
economic or planning advisers to the Governments of Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic,
Ghana, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, the
Philippines, and the Sudan. Similar assignments
in Guatemala, Honduras and Thailand were completed during the year.

418

The Bank agreed to organize and help finance
a study of transportation in Northern Rhodesia.
As Administrator of the Indus Basin Development Fund, the Bank organized a study of the
water and power resources of West Pakistan, to
be financed by the Fund. Studies were continued
of problems of coal transport in Jndia, of electric
power development in Ecuador, and of school
design and construction methods in Tunisia.
The Bank provided technical assistance to the
Iranian Electricity Authority. Studies were completed of the transport needs of the Republic of
China and of Ecuador, as were studies of the
development of secondary roads in Northern
Nigeria and of water and sewerage for the
Manila area of the Philippines. Field work was
completed in connection with a proposed new
crossing on the Hooghly River in Calcutta,
India. Altogether, the Bank has financed or is
helping to finance 14 project and sector studies
in 12 member countries; the estimated cost to
the Bank is approximately $3.8 million.

The Bank also continued to act as Executing
Agency for project and sector studies financed by
the United Nations Special Fund, drawing up
the plan of operations for the studies, recruiting
the necessary expert assistance and otherwise
supervising the work done. During the year,
field work was begun on three projects: a study
of the technical feasibility and economic implications of a railway to transport iron ore in
Gabon, a survey of the road requirements for the
agricultural development of southern Paraguay,
and a study looking toward port and railway
development in Costa Rica. Field work was completed on the Costa Rican study and on a
survey of coal deposits in Colombia. A study of
port facilities in Thailand was being extended to
include consideration of the possibility of expanding port capacity at Bangkok. Final reports
were completed on power requirements in the
Sudan, power and irrigation projects in Guatemala and a regionally integrated telecommunications system in Central America and Panama.
The Bank has agreed to act as Executing Agency
for two new Special Fund studies: a survey of
telecommunications needs in Pakistan and a
transportation study in Surinam.

Among special assignments undertaken or
carried forward during the year, studies of capital

markets predominated. The team that has been
studying the capital market in Chile completed
field investigations and its report is now in
preparation; a consultant finished a report on
measures for improving the mobilization of domestic savings in Tunisia; and the Bank retained
experts to make preliminary surveys of capital
markets in Pakistan and Peru. A mission to offer
advice on the financing of development in
Portugal was composed in part of staff members
of the Bank and the International Monetary
Fund. In another special assignment a staff
member continued to advise the Finance Ministry of Malaysia on the organization of economic
data. An adviser on agriculture completed his
assignment in Panama.

THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE
conducted its ninth general course in English
and its third in French. So far, 317 officials from
84 of the less developed countries have participated in the courses of EDI. During the year
EDI began to distribute the first items of a
Spanish-language library on economic development. The library is being donated to central
banks, finance ministries, planning organizations and other institutions. It contains some
400 books, studies and articles; for Portugucsespeaking areas, items in Portuguese are being
substituted when possible. The cost of this
project is being shared by the Inter-American
Development Bank. EDI also continued its own
contribution to the literature of economic development. A monograph on planning in Pakistan,
the third in a series of case studies, was published
by The Johns Hopkins Press during the year.
The monograph is one of a series produced on
the experience of many of the Bank’s member
countries in the organization and implementation of development programing. The study
ultimately will appear in book form.

With the help of a Bank loan, Israel has
been building a new port at Ashdod on the

NOTE: Detail may not add to totals because of rounding. Detailed Statements of Bank Loans and IDA Credits are available on request.ANNEX The information in this section describes
Bank loans, IDA credits and other activities of both
institutions during the fiscal year. Money amounts are
usually expressed in United States dollar equivalenis.

Bank loans to borrowers other than member governments carry the guarantee of the governments concerned,
and the participations of financial institutions in the
loans were all without the Bank’s guarantee.

All IDA credits were made to the governments concerned, on identical terms: No principal repayments are
to be made for the first 10 years; thereafter 1% per
annum is repayable for the next 10 years and 3%
per annum is repayable for the final 30 years. The
credits are free of interest, but a service charge of
34 of 1% per annum is payable on the amounts withdrawn and outstanding, to meet the administrative
costs of IDA.

This Annex also records commitments during the
year by the Bank’s other affiliate, the International
Finance Corporation. Fuller descriptions of those commitments are given in the Annual Report of IFC,
which is published simultaneously with the Bank/IDA
Report.

A four-man mission was organized by the Bank
to study the special problems of agriculture in
Africa south of the Sahara. The group began its
field work in Kenya, and will next visit
Tanganyika.

ALGERIA
INDUSTRY

$20.5 million 12-year 54% Bank loan of May 14, 1964,
to the Compagnie Algerienne du Methane Liquide
(CAMEL).

This loan will help to finance a natural gas
liquefaction plant at Arzew on the Mediterranean coast of Algeria. The plant will produce
2.4 million cubic meters of liquefied natural gas
annually for sale in England and France. It will
be the first large-scale commercial installation
of its kind. Gas will be supplied through an
existing pipeline from the Hassi R’Mel field in
the Sahara. The liquefied product will be transported by special tankers to England and France.
Other major installations at Arzew will be a

2110,600-kilowatt power plant, four storage tanks,
and port facilities for the berthing and loading
of tankers. The total cost of the project, including start-up expenses, is estimated at $89 million.

CAMEL is owned 40% by Conch International Methane Ltd., an international group,
40% by a French-Algerian group, and 20% by
an agency of the Algerian Government. The
project represents the first major industrial investment by foreign capital in Algeria since the
country became independent. It will make
possible the economic utilization of an important natural resource, assure the profitable operation of an extensive pipeline and increase
Algeria’s royalty and tax receipts. The Government also will benefit as a shareholder in
CAMEL.

The term of the Bank loan has been set at
12 years, but provision is made for accelerated
amortization under certain conditions depending on the level of profits. The Bank loan is
guaranteed by the Algerian Government and,
subject to certain conditions, by Conch International Methane Ltd. and three shareholders
in the French-Algerian group.

ETHIOPIA
ELECTRIC POWER

$23.5 million 25-year 514% Bank loan of May 8, 1964,
to Ethiopian Electric Light and Power Authority
(EELPA).

All public power in Ethiopia is supplied by
EELPA, except supplies to Asmara, which is
served by a private company. Consumption of
power in Ethiopia is still very low but has been
increasing substantially; between 1959 and 1963,
the number of customers served by EELPA rose
from 28,000 to nearly 50,000. Power sales during
the past five years have been growing at a rate

of 30% annually and are expected to increase
by as much as 20% a year for a number of years
to come.

The loan will assist in financing the second

and third stages of the Awash River hydroelectric development southeast of Addis Ababa,
They will provide 64,000 kilowatts of new capacity to augment the 23,000 kilowatts already
available from the first stage. The program also
includes the expansion of transmission and distribution facilities in EELPA’s main interconnected system which extends from Addis Ababa
eastward some 220 miles to Harar, as well as 22
diesel units with a combined capacity of 5,800
kilowatts in areas remote from the main system.
The total cost of these projects is estimated at
$34.9 million.

GABON

The Bank is acting as Executing Agency for a
UN Special Fund project begun in Gabon this
year. It comprises (a) surveys of the technical
and economic feasibility of a railway to transport iron ore from the Mekambo mines to a
seaport near Libreville and (b) studies of the
impact the railway would have on the economic
development of Gabon.

GHANA

A member of the Development Advisory Service continued to serve as Resident Representative and was available to advise the Government
on economic and financial matters. He was
assisted until August 1963 by a staff member
who worked primarily with the National Planning Commission of Ghana, advising on methods
for mobilizing internal and external financial
resources for development.

KENYA

In November 1961, the Bank made a loan of
$8.4 million to Kenya, with the guarantee of the
United Kingdom, for a project to develop farmlands for the settlement of African families on

2324

180,000 acres in the highlands formerly reserved
for Europeans. The Bank loan, together with a
loan of $4.2 million from the Commonwealth
(then Colonial) Development Corporation, was
to be used for farm development purposes, such
as water supply, fencing, access roads, farm
buildings and the planting of cash crops. Implementation of the project was delayed partly by
changes in the organization of settlement affairs
in Kenya and partly by changes in the prospects
for some of the crops to be developed under the
project. These developments required alterations
in the original loan documents, and a Supplemental Agreement was drawn up and signed on
April 2, 1964 by the Bank, Kenya and the
United Kingdom.

The character of the original scheme remains
essentially the same, but under the new arrangements, the average size of the farms has been
enlarged so that the number planned has been
reduced from 7,800 to 5,744, and greater emphasis has been given to the raising of dairy cattle.
The total estimated cost of the project has been
reduced because of the less expensive type of
development. Consequently the amount to be
drawn from the Bank loan may be less. The
guarantee of the loan by the United Kingdom
continues in effect.

LIBERIA

TRANSPORTATION—HIGHWAYS

$3,250,000 18-year 514% Bank loan of January 8,
1964, to Liberia.

This is the Bank’s first loan to Liberia. It will
help to build two new roads totaling 62 miles
and will pay for equipment and materials to
improve maintenance of the country’s entire
road system. Most of Liberia’s road network has
been built in the last 10 years, during which road
mileage increased from 300 to 1,700 and the
number of motor vehicles rose from 650 to about
10,000. The development of roads has stimulated economic growth; because travel time
from production to consuming centers has been
cut from weeks to hours, outlying districts now
provide foodstuffs to the capital city of Monrovia
and other population centers, and the production
of rubber, cocoa, coffee and other cash crops
has increased considerably.

Since the road network is still small, however,

for the country’s size and population, the project
being assisted by the Bank is an important step
in further road development. Initially, one of the
new roads will be an access route to a planned
logging and sawmill operation in virgin forests.
Ultimately it should help promote agricultural
as well as timber development and bring an
entire region in western Liberia within economic
reach of Monrovia and of two of the country’s
large iron-ore mining complexes. The second
road is part of a new 35-mile road being built to
replace a long roundabout route from Monrovia
to Robertsfield, the center of rubber production
and the site of Liberia’s international airport.
Better road maintenance will restore Liberia’s
main trunk roads to good condition and keep
them operable thereafter. The total cost of the
construction and maintenance projects is estimated at $4.5 million.

Because of Liberia’s difficult financial position
over the next few years, and the recent action
of other foreign creditors in accepting a rearrangement of Liberia’s external debt, the
Bank set the commencement of amortization of
its loan for June 1972—a longer grace period
than is usual in Bank loans.

LIBYA

A member of the Development Advisory
Service continued to serve as Economic Adviser
to the Prime Minister. In October 1963 another
member of the DAS began a two-year assignment as Principal Adviser on Planning to the
Ministry of Finance and Development.

MAURITIUS

ELECTRIC POWER

$7 million 20-year 514% Bank loan of September 23,
1963, to Mauritius.

Mauritius, a British colony in the Indian
Ocean, has an area of 720 square miles and a
population of 691,000, making it one of the
most crowded areas of the world. Public power
on the island is supplied by the Central Electricity Board (CEB), which now serves about
half the population. The generating capacity of
CEB’s power plants is approximately 30,000
kilowatts, which it supplements in the dry season
by power bought from private plants on sugarestates. Two severe cyclones in 1960 damaged the
system and curtailed sales of power.

With the rehabilitation of the system, the
extension of service to new areas, probable
industrial expansion, and the growing population, annual power sales are expected to grow at
a rate of 11% through 1970. The project being
assisted by the Bank loan should enable CEB to
meet the island’s requirements until that time.
It includes the first stage of the Fort Victoria
diesel power station at Port Louis with an initial
capacity of 12,000 kilowatts. In addition, transmission facilities will be reinforced in the area of
heaviest electricity consumption, the distribution
system will be reconstructed and expanded in
the towns to provide better service, and the
service area will be extended. The total cost of
the project is estimated at $8.6 million. The loan
is guaranteed by the United Kingdom.

NIGER
TRANSPORTATION--HIGHWAYS
$1.5 million IDA credit of June 24, 1964.

Niger, a landlocked country, has to rely on
the transport systems and ports of neighboring
Nigeria and Dahomey for its foreign trade.
Because of the long distances to ports—over
800 miles—the high transport costs of Niger’s
overseas trade has a detrimental effect on the
economy.

Groundnuts, the chief export, are grown
mainly in the southeastern part of the country,
where the IDA credit will finance two small,
high priority road projects. A 21-mile earth road
from Damthiao to Dungass will be improved
and a new laterite-surfaced road of about the
same length will be built from Dungass to
Maigatari on the Niger-Nigerian border. On its
side of the border, the Government of Northern
Nigeria intends to complete the paving of a road
which links Maigatari with the railhead at
Kano. The project roads will reduce the cost of
transporting groundnuts from the Dungass area
by nearly half and should also attract additional
settlers to the area and stimulate increased
agricultural activity.

The amount of Government revenues which
can be spared for road expenditures is needed to
finance essential maintenance operations, and
almost all new construction is being financed
wholly by external aid. In these circumstances
the IDA credit will cover the total cost (excluding import taxes) of the Dungass roads, most of
which is foreign exchange.

NIGERIA

ELECTRIC POWER

$30 million 20-year 514% Bank loan of March 12,
1964, to the Electricity Corporation of Nigeria.

The Electricity Corporation of Nigeria, which
is responsible for providing electric power
throughout the country, is carrying out a sixyear expansion program designed to establish
a national power grid and to provide enough
thermal capacity to meet requirements until
1969, when the hydroelectric power project at
Kainji in the Niger River should be in operation.
The Corporation now operates thermal plants
with a combined capacity of 216,700 kilowatts.
The program contemplates the addition of
220,000 kilowatts of new thermal capacity, 840

miles of transmission lines, and extension of
distribution systems. The Bank loan will finance
the foreign exchange costs of the transmission
and distribution facilities to be built during the
first 314 years of the program at an estimated
total cost of $42.3 million. These include about
640 miles of high-voltage transmission lines,
extensions of the existing systems at Port Harcourt, Lagos and Ibadan, and the expansion of
distribution facilities at various centers to be
served by the new power network. These works
will create three transmission systems—one each
in the Eastern and Northern Regions and the
third in the Western and Mid-West Regions—
which subsequently will be part of the national
grid.

NORTHERN RHODESIA AND
SOUTHERN RHODESIA

Prior to the dissolution of the Federation of
Rhodesia and Nyasaland on December 31, 1963,
the Bank had made five loans totaling $146.6
million for electric power, railways and agriculture, and a total of $125.4 million was still
outstanding on that date. The loans had been
made directly to the Federation or carried the
guarantee of the Federation. The Bank undertook negotiations with Northern Rhodesia,
Southern Rhodesia, the Federal Power Board
(now the Central African Power Corporation),
the Rhodesia Railways and the United Kingdom (which guaranteed all the loans), so that
the loan documents could be altered to take into
account the new political situation. As a result
of the negotiations, effective January 1, 1964,
Southern Rhodesia assumed a total obligation of
$69.8 million and Northern Rhodesia assumed
an obligation of $55.6 million. The United
Kingdom guarantec of the five loans continues
in effect.

TANGANYIKA
EDUCATION
$4.6 million IDA credit of December 19, 1963.

The expansion of secondary schools is vital
to the economic development of Tanganyika.
There is an urgent and increasing demand for
secondary school graduates, both for direct
employment and for further training in the
administrative and professional fields, private
and public. The need is all the more pressing
as expatriate civil service officials depart. In
five years, Tanganyika will need to have trained
and available twice the number now employed
in such careers as teaching and engineering, as
well as a wide range of technicians in other
fields.

In 1962 the Government began a program to
expand the secondary school system which will
increase the number of places for students to
24,300, The IDA credit is assisting this program
and will be used for the construction of two new
schools and the extension and equipment of 53
others, providing in all nearly 6,900 additional
places for students. Because of Tanganyika’s
scattered population, boarding facilities are
necessary in some cases to enable pupils to
attend regularly. The two new schools to be
built with IDA assistance will be government
boarding schools; the 53 schools to be enlarged
include 12 government and 27 voluntary agency
boarding schools, and 8 government and 6
yoluntary agency day schools. The total cost of
construction, improvement and equipment is
estimated at $6 million. The program is already
well under way, and student enrollment in the
new facilities commenced this year.TRANSPORTATION~HIGHWAYS
$14 million IDA credit of February 5, 1964,

The road system in Tanganyika is of primary
importance, since the railways serve only parts
of the country and the population, widely dispersed over a large area, requires an extensive
transportation network. There are some 10,000
miles of main roads which serve as trunk routes
between provincial centers and with neighboring
countries. Their quality, however, is very uneven, with paved sections near the towns and
long stretches between towns with only earth
surfacing. The project being assisted by the IDA
ercdit is a step toward the construction of an
interconnected all-weather highway system. It
consists of the construction or improvement of
eight main roads in various parts of the country,
totaling 734 miles. All the roads are important
to production and trade, as they serve areas now
producing cash crops or with a potential for
agriculture.

Three of the roads are part of the main system
which radiates from the capital, Dar es Salaam,
and serves most of the major towns and some of
the most productive lands in the country. A
fourth road also runs from Dar es Salaam
through an area of established agriculture with a
large capability for increased production of foodstuffs for the fast-growing population of the
capital. A fifth road serves an agricultural
region in the south, near the Mozambique border: and a sixth extends from Mbeya to the
northern end of Lake Nyasa, The other two are
in northern Tanganyika in the vicinity of Lake
Victoria, The improved roads will result in
better routes for growing traffic, lower transport
costs, faster transportation of agricultural produce to consuming centers and ports, and savings in road maintenance costs.

TUNISIA
TRANSPORTATION-~PORT
$7 million 25-year 514% Bank loan of June 5, 1964,
to Tunisia.

This loan will assist in creating a modern port
for Tunis, which handles over half the country’s

foreign trade and serves an area containing more
than half Tunisia’s population of four million.
The volume of traffic, nearly 2.4 million tons a
year, is beyond the capacity of the port to handle
efficiently, and is expected to increase by a
quarter in the next decade. Most of the general
cargo is now handled at the old port of Tunis
at the landward end of a six-mile canal across
the Lake of Tunis. Since there is no room for
expansion at Tunis and the approach is difficult,
the Government intends to transfer port operations progressively to the new port of La
Goulette at the seaward end of the canal, where
conditions are more favorable.

The project consists of the construction of two
new, fully equipped berths at La Goulette, a
passenger terminal and office buildings, and the
equipping of five existing berths with transit
sheds and warehouses. It also includes the relocation of the access road and of the breakwater
at the harbor entrance, and the extension of the
road and rail network within the port area. The
total cost of the works to be undertaken is estimated at $11.4 million. The project will enable
La Goulette to handle a total of about one
million tons of general and bulk cargo annually.
Passenger liners and cruise ships will also be
diverted to La Goulette where the new terminal
will replace old, inadequate facilities at Tunis.

CHINA
AGRICULTURE—FISHERIES

$7.8 million 15-year 514% Bank loan of September 27,
1963, to the Republic of China.

This, the Bank’s first loan to China, will
finance the foreign exchange costs of building
and equipping 16 modern deep-sea fishing
vessels to expand the country’s tuna fishing fleet.
It is estimated that a total of $9.4 million will be
invested in the project. Population pressure on
Taiwan’s limited arable land has brought about
an acceleration in the development of the fishing
industry in the last 10 years. As a result, the
fishing fleet has grown to some 5,800 powered
vessels, the annual catch has increased to well
over 300,000 metric tons, and the industry
employs about 300,000 people, providing support for over twice that number.

The catch of tuna has increased substantially
with the introduction of deep-sea fishing vessels.
When the new vessels join the fleet, the value of
Taiwan’s annual catch of fish is expected to
increase by the equivalent of over $4.5 million.
The expansion will provide more employment,
augment domestic food supply and, since twothirds of the catch will be exported, will substantially increase foreign exchange earnings.

INDIA
INDUSTRY
$90 million IDA credit of June 9, 1964.

Within the last decade there has been considerable development in India of manufacturing firms capable of producing sizable quantities
of capital equipment. This has shifted part of the
import demand from finished goods to components and materials for inclusion in domestic
products. Because of the shortage of foreign
exchange, however, manufacturers have not
been able to purchase all their import requirements, with the result that plant capacity has not
been fully utilized.

The IDA credit will enable companies in
three major industries—commercial vehicles, industrial machinery and construction equipment
—to import components and materials on a
larger scale than has been possible up to now and
thus to make fuller use of existing capacity and
to produce more capital goods. In the industries
directly affected, it should make possible an
increase of output averaging as much as 30%
in the year ending March 31, 1965.

The construction industry, which has been
handicapped by a scarcity of spare parts for its
equipment, will also benefit from the IDA credit.
Funds are provided for the import of spare
parts for heavy earthmoving and construction
equipment already in India, of additional supplies of such equipment, and of transporters to
move the equipment from one project site to
another. Furthermore, the Government is taking
measures to ensure the maintenance in India of
adequate stocks of spare parts and to expedite
their delivery. This should speed up the execution of various development projects throughout
India, particularly in the fields of irrigation and
electric power.

The proceeds of the credit will be made available to participating firms and agencies through

the import licensing procedures of the Government of India; the procedures will be streamlined
to ensure an expeditious use of the credit.

OTHER ACTIVITIES + The Bank continued to
maintain a Resident Representative in New
Delhi. Two meetings of the Consortium on Aid
to India were held during the year. Participants
were Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the United

In August 1963, the Consortium pledged the
equivalent of $1,052 million, subject as appropriate to legislative or other necessary authorization, to assist the third year (April 1, 1963 to
March 31, 1964) of the current Indian FiveYear Plan. Of this amount, the Bank and IDA
share was $245 million. In May 1964 the
equivalent of $1,028 million was pledged for the
fourth year of the Plan, again subject as appropriate to legislative or other necessary authorization; the Bank and IDA share was $245 million.

The Bank agreed to make an additional allocation of $100,000 to expand the scope and
complete the study of India’s coal transport
problem. This brought the Bank’s total allocation to $850,000. Field work on a study looking

TRANSPORTATION—HIGHWAYS,

$18.5 million 20-year 514% Bank loan of June 10, 1964,
to Iran.

Roads are the principal means of transport in
Tran. The Government is carrying out a continuing program of construction and improvement to provice paved roads for the movement
of freight and passengers between important
centers of industry, commerce and agriculture,
and to accommodate the country’s rapidly growing volume of traffic. There are now some 4,000
miles of paved main roads in Iran; a Bank loan
of $72 million in 1959 financed a third of the
cost of building 1,560 miles of these roads.

The Government now has under way the
construction or improvement of a further 770
miles of main roads. This year’s Joan will assist
in financing five sections of these roads totaling
425 miles. It will also finance a survey and
preliminary engineering of roads selected for
future improvement. The work being assisted by
the Bank loan is expected to cost a total of
$44.2 million.

The project will extend the benefits already
obtained from the earlier road program. It
resulted in better access to semi-isolated regions
in many parts of the country, a drastic reduction
in the time and cost of moving people and
freight, and a great increase in the frequency of
service of public carriers. Of particular importance was the improvement of the north-south
artery from the Caspian Sea through the Tehran
area to the Gulf ports, on which the volume of
traffic has doubled since 1959.

$75 million 26-year 514% Bank loan of September 27,
1963 and

$50 million 25-year 514% Bank loan of April 22, 1964,
to Nihon Doro Kodan.

Both loans will help finance the construction
of additional sections of the toll expressway
which will eventually extend 333 miles from
Tokyo to Kobe. ‘The $75 million loan was for
the 100-mile section between Tokyo and
Shizuoka, and the $50 million loan was for the
49-mile section between Toyokawa and Komaki
in the Nagoya area. The total cost of the
Tokyo-Shizuoka section, including construction,
land acquisition, and engineering, is estimated at
$628 million; the cost of the Toyokawa-Komaki
section is expected to be $202 million. Two earlier
Bank loans totaling $80 million helped to finance
114 miles of the expressway from Nagoya to
Kobe, of which 88 miles are already open to
traffic. With the exception of a section extending
about 23 miles from the suburbs of Tokyo,
which will be six-lane, the Tokyo-Kobe expressway will be a four-lane, limited-access, highspeed, divided highway with interchanges, service areas, bus stops, toll stations and traffic
control facilitics.

The expressway, when completed, will be the
most important highway in Japan. It will traverse the most highly industrialized and populated area of the country, and will link five of
Japan’s six largest cities: Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka,
Kyoto and Kobe. It will relieve the acute shortage of transportation capacity in this area,
providing for the safe and rapid movement of
freight and passenger traflic at reduced cost.

JORDAN
WATER SUPPLY

$3.5 million IDA credit of December 12, 1963.

One of the most pressing problems for municipal authorities in Jordan has been the provision
of water. The large influx of people into the
towns has put a strain on existing supplies and,
despite rationing, the chronic water shortage
seriously affects living conditions. The Government therefore has given high priority to improv-ing water supply systems. An IDA credit of
$2 million was made in 1961 to improve the
system in Amman, the capital, and this year’s
credit will assist similar projects in the four next
largest urban centers: Ramallah in the Jerusalem
area, Zarga, Irbid-Mafraq, and Nablus. None
of these centers has a sizable source of usable
surface water nearby, and the projects involve
the development of new sources. New well fields
will be developed for Zarqa and Nablus; water
for the Irbid-Mafraq area will be pumped 85
miles through a salvaged petroleum pipeline,
serving numerous towns and villages en route;
and a pipeline about 16 miles long will bring

water from a large spring to Ramallah .The main
components of the projects in each case involve
collection works, transmission mains, pumping
facilitics, reservoirs and related facilities and
improvement or expansion of distribution systems. The total cost of the works being undertaken is estimated at $5.2 million.

The projects will be carried out by the Central
Water Authority to which the proceeds of the
IDA credit will be relent initially by the Government of Jordan. After the works are completed
the new facilities as well as the Authority’s
financial liabilities will be transferred to operating agencies. The funds will be repaid to the

three years of grace, with interest at 4% per
annum.

AGRICULTURE
$3 million IDA credit of December 12, 1963.

Most of Jordan’s land area is desert, and only
about 10 % is cultivated at any one time. Despite
unfavorable climatic conditions, agriculture is
the mainstay of the economy. Output can be
increased both through intensification of production and through expansion of agricultural
area. If sustained agricultural growth is to be
achieved, however, the Government’s efforts to
improve agricultural research, extension services
and marketing facilities must be accompanied
by an expansion of credit facilities. The IDA
credit will help to fill this need by providing

 

additional resources for the lending program of
the Agricultural Credit Corporation (ACC), the
largest institutional source of agricultural investment credit in Jordan. To make its operations
more effective, ACC will also receive technical
assistance in accounting and lending procedures,
and the IDA credit will include funds to cover
the foreign exchange costs of experts and
accounting equipment.

ACC will make loans for the reclamation and
improvement of land, the establishment of permanent plantations, some irrigation, and onfarm development. There will also be modest
investments in farm mechanization, livestock
production, and farm and storage buildings.
These measures are expected to bring about an
increase in food crops and dairy products for
domestic consumption—thus lessening Jordan’sdependence on imported foodstuffs which accounted for nearly a third of all imports in 1961
—and in export crops, mostly olives and
vegetables.

The Government of Jordan will relend the
proceeds of the IDA credit to ACC which will
repay the Government over a period of 10 years,
after a 10-year period of grace, with interest at
34% per annum. ACC will in turn relend the
funds to farmers and agricultural enterprises at
an interest rate of not less than 514 % per annum
at maturities appropriate to individual projects.

MALAYSIA
INDUSTRY—DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANY
$8 million Bank loan of July 15, 1963, to Malaysian
Industrial Development Finance Limited (MIDFL).
MIDFL was established in 1960 by Malayan
and foreign investors to assist in the expansion
of private industry. The Bank loan, together with
an investment by the Bank’s affiliate, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), are part
of a series of measures taken to strengthen the
organizational and capital structure of MIDFL
to enable it to make a larger contribution to the
industrial development of Malaysia. The immediate financial resources available to MIDFL
rose from M$10.5 million (US§3.5 million) to
about M$62 million (US$20 million), as the
result of a M$7.5 million increase in share
capital—of which the IFC has subscribed
M$2.5 million (US$817,917)—a long-term,
interest-free loan from the Government of
Malaysia, and the Bank loan. Malaysian interests, together with the IFC, now hold just over
50% of MIDFL’s share capital, and the remainder
is held by financial institutions in France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Thailand, the
United Kingdom and the United States.
Although still at an early stage, industrial
development in Malaysia has shown a marked
upsurge in the past few years. Malaysian enterprises, however, have often been handicapped
by the inability of the local capital market to
channel an adequate share of domestic savings
to productive industrial ventures, in suitable

form and on suitable terms. MIDFL is designed
to meet this need by providing investment
capital in any form appropriate to its clients. It
can undertake equity participation, make medium and long-term loans, or provide other
financial and technical assistance to industry.
It will sell its equity participations as soon as is
practicable, so as to expand the ownership of
industrial securities and to recover its own
resources for additional investments.

The Bank loan will be committed, in parts,
for individual projects to be agreed upon from
time to time by the Bank and MIDFL. Each
part committed for a particular project to be
financed by MIDFL will be repaid according to
a schedule to be determined at the time of the
commitment, subject to a maximum term of
15 years. Interest will be applied to each part
of the loan at the Bank’s then current rate.

ELECTRIC POWER
$51.9 million 25-year 514% Bank loan of August 7,
1963, to the Central Electricity Board of Malaya (CEB).

The Central Electricity Board is the largest
supplier of electric power in Malaysia. The biggest project undertaken by CEB is the Cameron
Highlands scheme for developing the hydroelectric power potential of groups of streams on
the Cameron Highlands Plateau, about 100
miles north of Kuala Lumpur. A Bank loan of
$28.6 million made in 1958 is assisting the first
stage of the scheme which will provide 106,800
kilowatts of capacity. This year’s loan includes
funds for the second stage, the Batang Padang
project, which will add two more plants with a
combined capacity of 102,800 kilowatts. In addition, the loan will assist the construction of the
Prai thermal power station, with an initial
capacity of 60,000 kilowatts, on the west coast
in northern Malaya. Both projects are designed
for increases in capacity at a later date.

CEB’s transmission network is being expanded
to connect the new plants with existing facilities
and to interconnect all major power plants and
supply systems operated by CEB and other
utilities on the western side of Malaya. This will
increase firm generating capacity and realize
considerable savings in generating costs by using
both hydroelectric and thermal plants to their
best advantage. The total cost of the generating36

and transmission projects is estimated at $75
million.

PAKISTAN
AGRICULTURE
$9 million IDA credit of July 26, 1963.

This credit will assist in financing a flood
protection, drainage and irrigation project in
East Pakistan. About 95 miles of embankments
will be built around the project area, which lies
to the north and south of Chandpur on the
Meghna Estuary, to protect the land from flood
and tidal waters of the adjoining rivers. Two
dual purpose pumping stations and one small
drainage station will be built to drain an area of
some 135,000 acres and to provide irrigation
for 109,000 acres within this area. Other works
include irrigation canals, drainage channels and
necessary appurtenances. The total cost of the
project is estimated at $18.2 million. The Provincial Government of East Pakistan will provide agricultural extension services to farmers,
including guidance in the adoption of suitable
farming and irrigation practices; credit facilities
will be made available also. When the project
is in full operation, crops can be grown throughout the year and the increase in the net value of
farm production should be equivalent to more
than $6 million annually. This would double

farm incomes in one of the most densely populated agricultural districts of the world.

The project will be built and operated by the
East Pakistan Water and Power Development
Authority. The credit will be relenton IDA terms
by the Central Government of Pakistan to the
Province of East Pakistan, which will relend an
equivalent amount to the Authority for repayment over a period of 20 years, after a five-year
grace period, with interest at 4% a year.

WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE

$26 million IDA credit of August 16, 1963, for the
Dacca project and

$24 million IDA credit of August 16, 1963,

for the Chittagong project.

These credits will be used to provide adequate
and safe water supply and sewerage services in
Dacca and Chittagong, the two most important
cities in East Pakistan. Dacca is the capital and
leading commercial center, and Chittagong is
the main port. With the rapid growth of population in both cities since 1951, water supply and
sewerage services have become increasingly inadequate: in Dacca less than a third of the
population of 555,000 is directly served by the
public water systems and only about a tenth
have sewer connections. In Chittagong the water
systems serve just over a third of the population
of 365,500 and there is no public sewerage
system.

The water supply installations being assisted
by the IDA credit are designed to meet the
expected water requirements up to about 1978.
As part of the project the distribution systems
will be extended until about 70% of the populations of both cities are served directly in 10 years.
‘The sewerage schemes for the two cities will be
the first phase of long-range programs which
ultimately will provide facilities for the entire
municipal areas. When this phase is completed
in about six years, approximately half the people
who have water connections will be served by
the sewer systems and connections will continue
to be expanded thereafter. Public sanitary structures will be built in both cities for those who
cannot afford individual water and sewerage
connections. The total cost of the Dacca project
is estimated at $50 million and of the Chittagong
project, $43 million.The Government of Pakistan will relend the
proceeds of the IDA credits to the Province of
East Pakistan on IDA terms, and the Provincial
Government will relend an equivalent amount
to the Dacca and Chittagong Water Supply and
Sewerage Authorities for repayment over 20 and
25 years respectively, after 514-year grace
periods, with interest at 314% a year.

EDUCATION

$8.5 million IDA credit of March 25, 1964, for West
Pakistan project and

$4.5 million IDA credit of March 25, 1964,

for East Pakistan project.

These credits will assist the expansion and
improvement of two agricultural universities,
one at Lyallpur in West Pakistan and the other
at Mymensingh in East Pakistan, six technical
institutes in West Pakistan and eight in East
Pakistan, and Technical ‘Teacher Colleges at
Karachi, Rawalpindi and Dacca.

Although Pakistan has made considerable
progress in the past 15 years in expanding and
modernizing its educational system, facilities are
still far short of the country’s requirements. ‘The
shortage of professionally trained personnel for
agriculture and industry is particularly acute.
Consequently, the Government is taking measures to increase the number of university-trained
agriculturists to 840 annually by 1970 and of
trained technicians in industry to 7,000 by the
same year. The projects assisted by IDA will
help to attain these goals.

At the Lyallpur and Mymensingh agricultural
universities, IDA funds will be used for the construction of academic and other buildings, for
site development and for the procurement and
installation of teaching equipment. At the 14
technical institutes, IDA funds will be used for
the procurement and installation of equipment
for classrooms, laboratories, libraries, workshops,
student hostels and administrative offices. Since
the success of the technical institutes depends on
the supply of qualified teachers, training programs are being expanded at the three Technical
Teacher Colleges. IDA funds will cover the
entire cost of a three-year program for the employment of expatriate teaching personnel in
certain specialized fields and for the overseas
training of Pakistani teachers who will replace

them. The cost of the project is expected to
total $26 million.

The Government of Pakistan will relend the
proceeds of the credits to the Provincial Governments of East Pakistan and West Pakistan on
IDA terms.

TRANSPORTATION—PORT
$17 million 25-year 519% Bank loan of May 14, 1964,
to the Trustees of the Port of Karachi.

This is the second Bank loan for expansion and
improvement of the port of Karachi, the only
deep-water port in West Pakistan. Since the
time of the first loan in 1955, traffic has exceeded
forecasts, rising from about 3 million tons to 5.6
million tons in 1963. This has overtaxed berthing
and cargo-handling facilities and resulted ina
chronic congestion of ships. The improvements
now being undertaken will relieve this situation
and provide enough capacity to handle part of
the increased traffic, which is expected to reach
about 8 million tons by 1970.

The loan will assist the reconstruction of four
berths at the East Wharves, the construction of
three new berths at the West Wharves, the construction of a new oil pier to replace an old,
dilapidated one, the widening and deepening of
the navigable channel to improve access to the
oil berths and reduce the risk of collision, and
the rehabilitation of the Manora breakwater at
the harbor entrance to help maintain the hydraulic regime and so ensure access to the port.
The berths at both Wharves will be provided
with transit sheds, passenger terminals, roads
and railways, electricity, water, bunkerage and
cargo-handling facilities. Since these measures
are the maximum that can be undertaken within
the present physical layout of the port, Bank
funds will be used also for the preparation of a
master plan for future port development. The
total cost of the project is estimated at $37.5
million.

TRANSPORTATION—NATURAL GAS PIPELINE
$15 million 20-year 514% Bank loan of May 14, 1964,
to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited.

The utilization of natural gas from the Sui
field in West Pakistan, one of the largest in the
world, began with a 346-mile pipeline from Sui
to Karachi which was built by the Sui Gas
Transmission Company with the assistance of a
Bank loan of $14 million made in 1954. Sui gas
has been an important element in the growth of
industry in Karachi, Hyderabad and other areas
in the south, as it provided ample supplies of
indigenous fuel.

 

Subsequently, natural gas became available
in northern parts of West Pakistan with the
completion of a 300-mile pipeline from Sui to
Multan and a limited pipeline system from the
Dhulian oil fields to the Rawalpindi area. Sui
Northern Gas Pipelines Limited, to which this
year’s loan was made, was formed in 1963 to be
responsible for the distribution of Sui gas in the
north. It has already taken over the Multan and
Rawalpindi systems, which it will improve and
expand. It will extend distribution of natural
gas from the Sui field farther into the north by
the construction of about 370 miles of pipeline
from Multan to Lyallpur, Lahore and the
Gharibwal/Dandot area. The total cost of new
construction is estimated at $35.5 million; the

The Bank, IDA and 6 cooperating governments
are financing a complex system of canals to
distribute irrigation waters in West Pakistan.
Shown here: a canal near the lower Ravi River.Bank loan will cover part of the foreign exchange required for this purpose. The gas will
provide an economical and dependable supply
of fuel to the expanding industries of the northern
region, and will accomplish substantial savings

TRANSPORTATION~~ HIGHWAYS
$22.5 million IDA credit of June 11, 1964, for East
Pakistan project and

$17 million IDA credit of June 11, 1964, for

West Pakistan project.

The credit of $22.5 million will assist the construction of a 150-mile two-lane, paved highway
between Dacca and Chittagong in East Pakistan.
The $17 million credit will assist the construction
of a 90-mile limited access, two-lane toll highway between Karachi and Hyderabad and three
bridges, over the Jhelum, Ravi and Sutlej Rivers,
in West Pakistan. Both credits include funds to
finance the services of consultants to advise and
assist the highway departments of the Provinces
and to undertake feasibility studies of road access
from the terminal points of both highways, which
extend only to the outskirts of the cities concerned, to the industrial and commercial areas
of the cities. Both roads will be the first designed
and built to modern standards in each of the
Provinces. The total cost of the East Pakistan
project is estimated at $45.5 million and of the
West Pakistan project, $35.5 million.

East Pakistan has only about 3,500 miles of
roads, which for the most part are unconnected
stretches, Railways and waterways are the chief
modes of transport. With an all-weather highway, a substantial volume of through and local
traffic should develop between Dacca and Chittagong. While bulk freight will continue to be
carried by rail and to some extent by river craft,
the highway will be used to transport high-value

freight, manufactured goods and foodstuffs between the two cities and intermediate towns. It
should also stimulate the development of local
agriculture and industry.

West Pakistan, with 21,000 miles of roads, has
a much more extensive network, but the roads
are not designed to meet the demands of modern
traffic. The Karachi-Hyderabad road will be the
first section of a projected national highway
which would extend from Karachi northward to
Lahore, Rawalpindi and Peshawar. Since the
new road will reduce the distance between
Karachi and Hyderabad by about 30 miles,
cutting the traveling time from five to three
hours, the volume of commercial and passenger
traffic is expected to increase rapidly.

‘TRANSPORTATION—RAILWAYS
$10 million IDA credit of June 24, 1964, for

Pakistan Eastern Railway and

$25 million IDA credit of June 24, 1964,

for Pakistan Western Railway.

The two credits will help to finance completion of the railway programs in East and West
Pakistan under the Second Five-Year Plan which
ends June 30, 1965. The Eastern Railway will
use the $10 million credit to finance signaling
equipment, plant and machinery for workshops,
equipment for ferry operations, special type
freight cars, and equipment and materials for
the double-tracking of the most heavily traveled
sections of the Dacca-Chittagong line. The
Western Railway will use the $25 million credit
to finance railcars and trailers, plant and machinery for workshops, track maintenance equipment, rails, sleepers and miscellaneous equipment. These credits, together with five earlier
World Bank loans totaling $93.7 million, make
the railways the largest single beneficiary of
Bank/IDA lending in Pakistan.

By June 30, 1963, freight traffic on the Eastern
Railway was nearly 7 million tons annually and
the number of passengers carried was 72 million,
reflecting increases of 77% and 40%, respectively,
over a 7-year period. Freight traffic on the
Western Railway was 11.3 million tons and the
number of passengers carried 123.4 million,
showing increases of 36% and 41%, respectively,
over'a 7-year period. In both Provinces there is a
growing demand for all modes of transport. To

3940

assure priorities of investment among the alternative means of transport, the Provincial
Governments have recently reconstituted their
Transport Coordination Boards to advise on all
matters relating to transportation investments
and policy.

The Government of Pakistan will relend the
proceeds of the credits to the Provincial Governments of East and West Pakistan on [DA terms.
The Provincial Governments will in turn make
the proceeds available to the two Railways. The
parts of the credits used for replacements of
equipment and facilities will be repaid by both
Railways to the Provinces over a period of 20
years, including 314 years of grace, with interest
at 516%. On funds used for additions, the
Railways will pay interest of 4% annually.

INDUSTRY—-DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANY
$30 million Bank loan of June 30, 1964, to the
Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment
Corporation Limited (PICIC).

Since its establishment in 1957 by Pakistani
and foreign investors, with the assistance of the
World Bank, PICIC has become one of the leading institutions in Pakistan for the provision of
medium and long-term finance for private industry. It has been an effective channel for the
allocation of scarce foreign exchange to sound
industrial projects in the private sector, and the
projects it has financed have brought about
appreciable foreign exchange earnings or savings. Furthermore, its industry surveys and
market studies have broadened the range of
potential investment by private industrialists.

The loan made this year will provide PICIC
with about half the foreign exchange it will require until the end of 1965 for loans to new and
expanding industries. It increased PICIC’s resources to the equivalent of over $155 million.
Including earlier loans, the Bank has now lent
PICIC a total of $79.2 million, and the International Finance Corporation holds 5% of PICIC’s
paid-in share capital. Although PICIC takes
direct participations in share capital and underwrites new offerings of securities, lending has
been its main activity thus far. By the end of
December 1963 it had approved 361 loans
amounting to Rs. 551 million ($115.7 million) to
a variety of industries. Of the total, all but Rs.

35 million were foreign exchange loans and more
than three-fifths were to new enterprises.

Each part of the Bank loan committed for a
particular project will be repaid in semi-annual
installments according to a schedule determined
at the time of the commitment. Interest will be
applied to each portion of the loan at the Bank’s
rate prevailing when that portion is committed
for one of PICIC’s projects.

OTHER ACTIVITIES « The Bank continued to
maintain a resident mission, with offices in
Rawalpindi and Karachi, headed by a member
of the Development Advisory Service.

An expert engaged by the Bank to carry out a
preliminary survey of the capital market is
preparing his report.

The Bank is organizing a study of the water
and power resources of West Pakistan, financed
by the Indus Basin Development Fund, to assist
the Government in planning development of the
water and power sectors.

In April 1964 the Indus Basin Development
Fund (Supplemental) Agreement came into
force. Under it, the Governments of Australia,
Canada, Germany, New Zealand, the U.K., the
U.S., and the World Bank agreed to contribute
an additional amount of $315 million in foreign
exchange to be applied toward the cost of the
works to be constructed by Pakistan in the Indus
Basin. Of this amount, $58,540,000 was to be in
the form of a contribution by the Bank or IDA,
or both. The Bank and IDA decided that because of Pakistan’s heavy burden of external
debt, this contribution should be in the form of
an IDA credit.

The Bank has agreed to act as Executing
Agency for a UN Special Fund survey to determine the future telecommunications requirements of the country and to recommend measures

SYRIA
TRANSPORTATION—HIGHWAYS,
$8.5 million IDA credit of December 24, 1963.

Although Syria’s network of main roads has
been extended by nearly a third in the past
decade, it has not been adequate to mect the
requirements of rapidly increasing traflic. Many
sections of road have deteriorated badly and will
have to be reconstructed to bring them up to
suitable standards.

This credit will be used for the improvement
of two of the country’s most important highways:
the road from Damascus to Aleppo, the principal
north-south trunk highway, and the road from
Aleppo to Ragga, the transport route for produce coming from the main agricultural areas
in the east. The improvements should reduce
vehicle operating costs, achieve substantial savings in road maintenance expenditures, and
expedite the movement of goods between Syria’s
largest cities and between producing and marketing centers.

IDA funds will also finance consultant services for a program to reorganize and strengthen
the Department of Highways and Bridges, and
for an overall survey of the country’s roads to
assist in the formulation of a sound highway
investment program for the future. On the basis
of the survey, the consultants will prepare the
final design of about 375 miles of roads to be
constructed or improved in the next phase of this
program. The total cost of the project, including
improvement works, consultants’ fees and maintenance equipment, is expected to be $14 million.

THAILAND

INDUSTRY—DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANY
$2.5 million Bank loan of March 11, 1964, to the
Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand (IFCT).
IFCT, a private company, is the main institutional source of medium and long-term finance
for private industry in Thailand, The Bank loan,
together with an investment of 4 million Baht
($193,108) by the International Finance Corporation, were part of a series of measures taken
to increase the financial resources of IFCT to
B 187 million ($9.13 million), and thereby enable
it to make a more significant contribution to
industrial growth in Thailand. Paid-in share
capital, originally B 6.1 million, has been increased to B 30 million, while B 157 million of
loan capital is available to IFCT through the
Bank loan (B 52 million equivalent), B 48 million
in loans from the Government of Thailand and a
loan equivalent to B 57 million in foreign exchange from the Kreditanstalt fiir Wiederaufbau,
of Frankfurt, Germany. Four foreign investment
and banking institutions made their first investments in IFCT and seven of the existing 12
foreign shareholders increased their holdings in
the company. With the completion of the expansion, Thai investors, together with IFC, hold
approximately 59% of IFCT’s share capital.
The Bank loan will provide foreign exchange
for the purchase of imported equipment, materials and services. It will be committed in parts
for individual industrial projects to be agreed
upon from time to time by the Bank and IFCT.
Each part committed for a particular project to
be financed by IFCT will be repaid over a
period not exceeding 15 years, according to a
schedule to be determined at the time of the
commitment. Interest will be applied to each
part of the loan at the Bank’s then current rate.

NEW ZEALAND

TRANSPORTATION—PORTS

$7.8 million 25-year 514% Bank loan of November 12,
1963, to New Zealand.

This, the Bank’s first loan to New Zealand,
was for the improvement of five ports, Auckland,
Napier and Whangarei on the North Island, and
Timaru and Lyttelton on the South Island. The
projects are part of a continuing development
program being carried out at the larger ports to

modernize and expand facilities to handle traffic
more expeditiously and to provide for future
growth.

At Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city, quay
cranes, cargo-handling and dredging equipment
are being purchased and one of the wharves extended. At Lyttelton, the port of Christchurch,
the third largest city, quay cranes are being
provided at a new wharf. At Napier, a new finger
pier will be built, adding two berths to the six
now available. At Whangarei, the site of New
Zealand’s only oil refinery, tugs, a tug jetty, a
pilot launch, a slipway, navigational aids, a
workshop and offices are being provided. At
Timaru, which handles a growing volume of
meat exports, the main item is a mechanical
meat-loading installation; a transit shed will
also be built and cargo-handling equipment provided. The total estimated cost of the projects
being assisted by the Bank is $12.5 million.

The projects are being carried out by local
Harbour Boards to which the Government will

ELECTRIC POWER
$32.5 million 20-year 514% Bank loan of March 12,
1964, to New Zealand.

This loan was for the construction of an electric power transmission link to carry power from

43the Benmore station now under construction on
the South Island to the North Island, which
contains the greater part of New Zealand’s population and economic activity.

Until the mid 1950’s demand for power was
met almost entirely by the development of hydroelectric sites, mainly on the North Island. Most
of the economically attractive hydroelectric resources of the North Island have now been
largely developed, while large potential sites
remain unexploited in the South Island. Although thermal capacity has been installed on
the North Island, the prospects for its development on a large scale at costs comparable to
those of hydroelectric power are not promising.
The New Zealand Electricity Department has
therefore undertaken the construction of a highvoltage, direct-current transmission line to transfer up to 600,000 kilowatts of power from the
South Island to the North Island. The line will
be 350 miles long overland and submarine cables
will be laid for the crossing of the 25-mile wide
Cook Strait. The total cost of the transmission
facilities is estimated at $50 million. The successful operation of this link will open the way to
further developments of this kind to meet the
country’s power needs.

of Papua and New Guinea completed its field
work, and its draft report has been sent to the
Australian authorities for review.

The Bank’s $100 million loan for the Snowy

DENMARK
ELECTRIC POWER
$25 million 20-year 514% Bank loan of July 24, 1963,

to Denmark.

The loan will assist five utilities to expand
their generating capacity by 477,000 kilowatts of
thermal power and to construct 400 miles of new
transmission lines and associated facilities. The
projects, which will cost a total of $81 million,
will increase generating capacity in Denmark by
nearly a quarter. This will help Danish power
undertakings to keep abreast of industrial requirements and other power demand which is
increasing at a rate well over 10% a year.

The service areas of the five utilities are on the

Jutland Peninsula and the islands of Zealand and
Bornholm. Three of the utilities are expanding
existing plants in Esbjerg, Aarhus and Rgnne;
these plants also supply steam for district heating
purposes in the cities in which they are located
and these facilities will be extended. The other
two companies are building new thermal power
stations, one near Aalborg in the northern part
of Jutland, and the other near Skaelskgr in the
southwestern part of Zealand.

FINLAND
INDUSTRY — DEVELOPMENT FINANCE GOMPANY

$7 million Bank loan of September 18, 1963, to the
Teollistamisrahasto Oy (Industrialization Fund).

The Industrialization Fund, established in
1954 to provide finance for small and mediumsized industries in Finland, has been reorganized
to enable it to provide a wider range of financial
and technical assistance. Its financial resources
have been increased five-fold to a total of 62

 

4546

million markkas ($19.34 million) through
Fmk 14.5 million in new share issues and
Fmk 35.5 million in new borrowings.

The Bank joined with its affiliate, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), in providing part of this loan and share capital. IFC
subscribed Fmk 512,040 ($159,279), and the remaining shares were taken up by Finnish shareholders and by investment and banking
institutions in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the
United States. In addition to the Bank loan, the
new borrowings include new debenture issues
purchased by the Bank of Finland and the Post
Office Savings Bank, and a long-term loan from
private Finnish shareholders.

The Industrialization Fund’s financial operations will include loans, loans with equity features, equity investments, underwriting of new
issues and loan guarantees. A major objective
will be to aid the development of the capital
market in Finland by such means as underwriting operations and sales of equity participations.
The participation of foreign investors in its share
capital serves not only to increase the total resources of the Fund, but also to link the Fund
with foreign financing and business enterprises.

The Bank loan will be used to finance qualified
industrial projects to be agreed upon from time
to time by the Bank and by the Industrialization
Fund. Each part of the loan committed for a
particular project will be repaid according to a
schedule to be determined at the time of the
commitment, subject to a maximum term of 15
years. Interest will be applied to each part at the
Bank’s then current rate.

MALTA

ELECTRIC POWER AND WATER SUPPLY

$7.5 million 20-year 514% Bank loan of September 6,
1963, to Malta.

This loan, the Bank’s first to Malta, was for a
combined thermal electric power and sea water
distillation project. Malta is in the process of
building a diversified economy based on new
industries and expanded tourism, and additional
electric power and water are essential to the success of these efforts.

All of Malta’s water supply comes from underground sources, Since consumption is likely

to reach the maximum that can be obtained
from these sources—4,300 million imperial gallons annually—by 1965, the only practical way
of meeting future demand is through the conversion of sea water to fresh water. The distillation
plant will be a multi-stage “flash” type and will
be operated by steam supplied from the new
power plant. The power plant will have an initial
capacity of 25,000 kilowatts, or double the present capacity of Malta’s public electricity system,
and the distillation plant will have a capacity of
one million imperial gallons a day. The new
station is designed for an ultimate capacity of
100,000 kilowatts of power and water production
of six million gallons a day. The total cost of the
project is estimated at $10 million. The Government of Malta will relend the proceeds of the
Bank loan to a new public authority, the Malta
Electricity Board, which sells power to the public
and will supply water at cost from the new distiller to the Government’s Water Authority. The
loan is guaranteed by the United Kingdom.

ELECTRIC POWER

$25 million 25-year 514% Bank loan of October 15,
1963, to Norway.

The loan was for the construction of the
230,000-kilowatt Rana hydroelectric power station in northern Norway, the 110,000-kilowatt
hydroelectric power station at Trollheim in central Norway, and 130 miles of high-voltage
transmission lines with related facilities to link
the Rana station with the Trgndelag grid in
central Norway. The projects, which will cost a
total of $68.6 million, are part of a continuing
program being carried out by the Norwegian

A chief object of 15 years of Bank lending
in Finland has been io provide more electric

Norway’s large supplies of low-cost power
have constituted the basis for important electrochemical and electrometallurgical industries.
Economic development will continue to rely

heavily on the expansion of power-based industries during the present decade. The largest expansion is planned for aluminum. Present plans
call for a tripling of the capacity for aluminum
production to a level of about 600,000 tons annually by 1970. This should result in a corresponding increase in foreign exchange earnings.About 65% of the output of the two power plants
financed will be used by aluminum smelters.

PORTUGAL
ELECTRIG POWER

$7.5 million 25-year 514% Bank loan of November 6,
1963, to Hidro-Electrica do Douro and

$5 million 20-year 514% Bank loan of November 6,
1963, to Empresa Termoelectrica Portuguesa.

These were the Bank’s first loans in Portugal
and will assist two power projects which will add
260,000 kilowatts of generating capacity to the
national power network. The $7.5 million loan
was to partly finance a 210,000-kilowatt plant at
Bemposta which is the last of three hydroelectric developments on Portugal’s stretch of the
International Douro River. The $5 million loan
was for the installation of a third 50,000-kilowatt
unit to complete a thermal plant near Oporto.
Part of this loan is also financing preliminary engineering studies for another thermal plant to be
built near Lisbon. The total estimated cost of the
Bemposta project is $35 million, and of the installation at the Oporto plant, $9 million.

The expansion of manufacturing in Portugal
during the past decade has been accompanied
by a rapid growth in the use of electricity, with
industrial consumption quadrupling. Per capita
consumption, however, is still among the lowest
in Europe, and high priority has been given to
power development, particularly to an increase
in thermal capacity to firm up the predominant
hydroelectric capacity of the system.

SPAIN
TRANSPORTATION—HIGHWAYS

$33 million 20-year 514% Bank loan of October 25,
1963, to Spain.

Spain has a very extensive road network but a
large part of the system was built some 40 years
ago and design and maintenance methods are
inadequate for the volume and type of today’s
traffic. Despite a considerable increase in road
traffic due to economic growth and increased
foreign tourism during the past decade, motor
transport in Spain is still at an early stage of
development. Rapid expansion is expected as
the economy grows, and the Government has
embarked on a 16-year program to provide an
adequate road network.

This loan, the Bank’s first in Spain, will assist
high priority projects included in the first stage
of the program. These consist of the improvement or relocation of 460 miles of roads forming
the Madrid-Barcelona-Alicante triangle, including a new bridge across the Ebro River; the
construction of a 15-mile highway between
Oviedo and Figaredo in one of the most industrialized and important agricultural regions of
Spain; and a new 6.6-mile freeway between
Palma and the airport on Mallorca. Bank funds
will also be used for the establishment of two
pilot road-maintenance divisions in the Madrid
and Lerida areas as a first step toward a complete reorganization of highway maintenance
operations throughout the country. The total
cost of the improvement and maintenance works
is estimated at $91.5 million.

YUGOSLAVIA
TRANSPORTATION—-RAILWAYS

$35 million 25-year 514% Bank loan of October 28,
1963, to the Yugoslav Investment Bank.

This loan will assist the building of a 121-mile
standard-gauge railway between Sarajevo and
the port of Ploce, to replace a narrow-gauge
line. The new line will be electrified and
equipped with central traffic control.

The mountains of Yugoslavia obstruct access
to the sea except at a few gaps and the SarajevoPloce railway is one of the few routes to the
coast. It links the industrial centers of Bosnia
directly with the sea, and provides the only rail
link to Dubrovnik , the leading tourist attraction
on the Adriatic, to Niksic, the site of new steel
mills, and to Titograd, the capital of Montenegro.
It is also the most direct connection between the
Vojvodina, Yugoslavia’s most important agricultural area, and the coast.

Because of the limited capacity of the narrow
gauge line, over 214 million tons of freight annually have had to travel by more circuitous
routes to and from the coast. The new line will
be able to handle this additional tonnage, thereby freeing a very substantial amount of railway
capacity for other uses. It will also lower transport costs, speed up travel and stimulate industrial
and agricultural expansion in the areas served.
The Yugoslav Investment Bank will transfer the
proceeds of the Bank loan to the Community of
Railway Enterprises in Sarajevo which is building the Sarajevo-Ploce railway at a total estimated cost of $96 million.

AGRICULTURE AND PROCESSING

$19 million 15-year 514% Bank loan of December 18,
1963 and

$5 million 15-year 514% Bank loan of December 18,
1963, to the Corporacion de Fomento de la
Produccion (CORFO).

The $19 million loan was for a project which
provides for the improvement of 825,000 acres
of pastureland, together with the acquisition of
machinery, materials and breeding stock. Its
purpose is to increase Chile’s production of dairy
products, meat and wool by increasing the number of productive animals which can be carried
on pastures and by improving the average productivity per head through better feeding and
management. The total cost of the livestock
development program over three years is estimated at $58.6 million. The $5 million loan will
assist a related project for the modernization and
expansion of milk plants, slaughtcrhouses and
associated facilities, which will cost a total of
$8 million. The project will result in rationalization of the meat processing and distribution
system and nearly double the quantity of milk
processed through dairy plants.

CORFO will extend credits to farmers and
cooperatives for these purposes on terms ranging
from three to 12 years. This type of operation
has been one of CORFO’s activities for some
years. The loans will enable CORFO to expand
this phase of its operations to make it more consistent with the targets of Chile’s Ten-Year
Development Plan. High priority has been given
to the projects since Chile now imports substantial quantities of dairy products and meat, and a

reduction of these imports would save foreign
exchange expenditures.

OTHER ACTIVITIES - The Bank continued to
maintain its resident mission in Santiago.

A technical representative of the Bank continued to act as liaison with the Chilean authorities for the purpose of assisting in the execution
of highway construction and maintenance projects financed by an IDA credit and a Bank
loan made available in 1961.

Field work was completed for a study of ways
to make the Chilean capital market a more efficient instrument in the mobilization of domestic
savings for development. The study was directed
by a member of the Development Advisory
Service, and a report is now being prepared.
The Bank’s contribution to the cost of the study
amounted to $122,000.

ELECTRIC POWER

$5 million 20-year 514% Bank loan of July 16, 1963,
to the Electrificadora de Bolivar S.A. (Electribol) and
$45 million 35-year 514% Bank loan of February 7,
1964, to Empresas Publicas de Medellin.

The $5 million loan was for the addition of
25,000 kilowatts of capacity at the Cospique
thermal plant and for the rehabilitation and
expansion of the transmission and distribution
systems serving Cartagena, an important seaport and commercial center in northern Colombia. The project will more than double present
power supplies in the Cartagena area, providing
some standby capacity which is of particular
importance since the Cartagena system is not
interconnected with power sources of other
metropolitan areas.

The $45 million loan was for the first stage of
the Nare hydroelectric development to supply
more power to the Medellin area, where the
population has nearly quadrupled since 1938.
The city of Medellin is the center of Colombia’s
textile and clothing industry and the site of

| 51many other important industries. The Nare development is part of a continuing program being
carried out by Empresas Publicas de Medellin to
strengthen and enlarge its system to meet the
growing requirements of its service area. The
project includes a new power plant with an
initial capacity of 132,000 kilowatts, about 50
miles of double circuit transmission lines with
associated facilities, and an expansion of Empresas’ distribution system; its total cost is estimated at $75.5 million. The loan for the Nare
project, with a final maturity of 35 years, was
the longest ever made by the Bank.

Additional electric power and a modern telecommunications system are of prime importance
in the economic development of Costa Rica
where the Government is encouraging industrialization as one of the principal means of
maintaining a satisfactory growth of national
income.

An amount of $12.5 million of the loan will be
used for the construction of a 56,000-kilowatt
hydroelectric power plant near Cachi on the
Reventazon River and the extension of transmission facilities. This will increase generating
capacity of ICE, which supplies most of the
power in Costa Rica, to 139,000 kilowatts by
1966,

Telephone installations in Costa Rica have
been inadequate to meet the demand for service
for many years. The balance of the loan, $9.5

ECUADOR

TRANSPORTATION— HIGHWAYS

$9 million 25-year 514% Bank loan of May 26, 1964
and

$8 million IDA credit of May 26, 1964, to Ecuador.

This loan and credit were part of a joint transaction whereby the Bank and IDA joined with
the United States Agency for International Development (AID) and the Inter-American
Development Bank to provide the equivalent of
$39 million for a $62.2 million five-year national
highway program. AID financing for the program totaled $16 million, and the Inter-American
Bank, $6 million. The part of the program being
assisted by the four organizations involves the
completion of roads already under construction,
the construction or improvement of 314 miles of
additional roads, and the training and equipping
of a maintenance organization so that it can
provide adequate maintenance of about 3,000
miles of surfaced highways by 1968.

Ecuador’s highway system constitutes the
principal mode of transportation. Some key
roads were built or improved with the assistance
of earlier financing by the World Bank and AID,
and have already had a beneficial effect on the
economy. High priority has been given to the
current program: adequate maintenance is
essential to protect the substantial capital investments already made or to be made in highways; the roads to be built or improved will
make new and productive lands in the coastal
region accessible to efficient transportation, will
establish reliable communications between important urban centers, and will considerably
reduce vehicle operating costs.

PARTICIPATIONS totaling $120,000 in the $9 million Bank loan: by Bank of America National

OTHER ACTIVITIES + A study to help the
Government to formulate a long-range program
of investment for the improvement of transportation in the country was completed. The Bank
contributed $340,000 to cover the foreign exchange costs.

The Bank has agreed to make an additional
allocation of $100,000 for the continuation of
advisory assistance to Ecuador’s National Institute of Electrification in preparing the basis for a
national electrification plan. This brings the
Bank’s allocation to cover the foreign exchange
costs of this advisory assistance to $220,000.

El Salvador is encouraging industrial production, both for the local market and for the
Central American Common Market. Industrial
and business expansion is hampered, however,
by the limited capacity of the present telecommunications system. There are only 16,000
telephones in the whole country, about 6 per
1,000 people; in the capital, San Salvador, alone
there are over 12,000 applicants awaiting telephone service.

The loan will help to finance automatic ex
change equipment for 26,000 telephone lines in
the three principal cities, San Salvador, Santa
Ana and San Miguel, together with the construction of a micro-wave radio system connecting these three cities and several small
communities throughout the country. The total
estimated cost of these installations is $13.6 million. They are the first phase of a long-range
program and will meet the most immediate and
essential needs.

MEXICO

TRANSPORTATION —HIGHWAYS,

$40 million 20-year 514% Bank loan of September 20,
1963, to Nacional Financiera, S.A.

For many years the Mexican Government
has been carrying out a road improvement program and the highway network, although still
small in relation to area, has been nearly doubled
to 30,000 miles since 1955. Two earlier Bank
loans totaling $55.5 million have assisted this
development. This year’s loan will help to finance
the program during the 1963-66 period for which
total costs are estimated at $96 million.

The three-year program provides for the improvement or reconstruction of 1,340 miles of 11
paved roads, completion of 1,256 miles of 20
roads already under construction, and construction of 9 new roads totaling about 493 miles.
Maintenance and laboratory equipment will be

PARAGUAY
AGRICULTURE
$3.6 million IDA credit of December 26, 1963.

This credit will assist a three-year program to
improve and increase cattle production. Although cattle production is Paraguay’s principal
industry and main source of foreign exchange
earnings, the quantity and quality of cattle can
be greatly improved by the application of modern techniques. The primary need now is for
subdivision of pastures by fencing, adequate
water supplies and proper facilities for stock
handling. Under the program, funds will be
lent to ranchers for these purposes. With improved facilities they will be able to reduce costs
and progressively increase production up to
double present levels at approximately 12 years
after the investment is made. The program is
expected to involve approximately 5,000,000
acres now Carrying about 400,000 head of cattle.
It is a pilot operation which, if successful, will
provide the basis for wider application that
could have far-reaching effects on the economy.
Total investment in the program during the

three-year period is expected to be $6 million.
The Central Bank will administer the project
and act as agent for the Government in disbursing the IDA credit. Most of the credit will
be used for loans to ranchers for approved livestock development plans; ranchers will repay the
Central Bank in Paraguayan currency, usually
over 12 years with a four-year grace period and
interest at 9%. A small part of the credit will be
lent to contractors for the importation of machinery for building stock watering facilities,
principally earth tanks; these loans will have a
term of 3 to 5 years with interest at 9%. Repayment of funds from the IDA credit to the Central
Bank will be retained in a revolving fund for a
period of 20 years from the date of the credit and
used for further loans for ranch development.

southern Paraguay to open up virgin land for
settlement and agricultural development.

PERU
ELECTRIC POWER

$15 million 25-year 514% Bank loan of November 22,
1963, to Empresas Electricas Asociadas (Lima

Light and Power Company).

Lima Light and Power Company serves
Greater Lima which has a population of over
two million and is the administrative, commercial and industrial center of the country. To
meet the rapidly rising demand for electricity in
the area, Lima Light undertook an expansion
program in 1960, in which the main items were
the Huinco hydroelectric project about 40 miles
northeast of Lima, and the associated Marcapomacocha water diversion scheme. An earlier
Bank loan of $24 million assisted the first stage
of these projects, which included structures to
collect water from the Marcapomacocha Basin,
a six-mile diversion tunnel through the Andes to
bring waters to the Santa Eulalia Basin on the
western side, and the Huinco plant with an
initial capacity of 120,000 kilowatts.

This year’s loan is financing the second stage
under which additional waters will be diverted
to the tunnel, making possible a substantial increase in the output of existing power plants,more drinking water for Lima and enough
water for the irrigation of some 12,000 acres of
arid land south of Lima. Two more generating
units will be installed at Huinco bringing it to
its full capacity of 240,000 kilowatts. Bank funds
will also be used to strengthen and expand the
distribution system in Lima, connecting up 45,000 new customers. The total cost of these works
is estimated at $30 million.

PARTICIPATIONS totaling $615,000: by Bank of
America National Trust and Savings Association, Girard Trust Bank, Irving Trust Company,
Wells Fargo Bank, Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust
Company, The Bank of California National
Association, The Philadelphia National Bank,
The First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company, Grace National Bank of New York, and
Crocker-Citizens National Bank.

TRANSPORTATION—PORT
$3.1 million 25-year 514% Bank loan of April 22, 1964,
to Peru.

This loan was for the construction of a new
port at Paita, the main harbor of northern Peru.
The project includes the dredging of the port
area, construction of a jetty equipped to berth
four ocean-going ships simultaneously, adaptation of existing sheds, warehouses and other
buildings to port use, a new road approach to
the port, roads and utilities in the port area,
and modern cargo-handling and workshop
equipment.

The new port will speed up the turn-around
time of ships, materially reduce cargo-handling
costs, eliminate the long overland haulage of
certain goods destined for northern Peru which
now have to be imported through Callao some
600 miles to the south, and provide for the efficient handling of up to three times the present
volume of traffic. The Paita project will cost a
total of $5 million. It is part of a long-range
program to improve Peru’s public ports, except
Callao, which is being modernized and expanded with the assistance of earlier Bank
financing.

PARTICIPATIONS totaling $160,000: by Bank of
America, Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company,
Grace National Bank of New York, and The
Royal Bank of Canada Trust Company.

OTHER ACTIVITIES» The Bank’s Resident Representative continued in his post.

The Bank has provided an expert who is
carrying out a preliminary survey of the capital
market.

IFC COMMITMENT + $1,600,000 in a loan to
Compania de Cemento Pacasmayo, S.A., for a
program to expand the company’s production of
cement.

SURINAM

The Bank has agreed to serve as Executing
Agency for a port and transportation study financed by the UN Special Fund. Work continued on a UN Special Fund survey of mineral
resources, for which the Bank is serving as Executing Agency.

VENEZUELA

ELECTRIC POWER

$85 million 25-year 514% Bank loan of September 20,
1963, to C.V.G. Electrificacion del Caroni C.A.
(EDELCA).

The loan will assist construction of the first
stage of the Guri hydroelectric project on the
Caroni River, one of Venezuela’s most important sources of power. The ultimate capacity of
the Guri site is estimated at 6,000,000 kilowatts.
The first stage, which will cost a total estimated
at $137 million, includes the construction of a
dam about 300 feet high, a power plant with
350,000 kilowatts of capacity, and a 50-mile
transmission line to connect the plant with Ciudad Guayana. The initial capacity could be
expanded to 1,750,000 kilowatts in a second
stage by the installation of additional generating units without further increase in the height
of the dam.

The Guri project will help to realize the economic potential of the Guayanas, a region in
eastern Venezuela richly endowed with mineral
wealth. The Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG), a government agency responsible
for promoting development of the Guayanas,
has initiated a number of steps for industrial
development in the region. Industrial power
consumers already include three mining companies and a large steel mill; an aluminum plant
is to be built.

57El Novillo Dam, in

the State of Sonora,
i4exico, nears completion.
It is one of ten hydroelectric installations

being built with the

help of a $130 million
ank loan made in 1962.

58

EDELCA, established in 1963 as a subsidiary
of CVG, will operate Guri and the 365,000-kilowatt Macagua plant downstream. EDELCA
will sell power in bulk to other systems operating in Venezuela. The power requirements of
its combined market area—those of the Guayanas, CADAFE, the national power company,
and Caracas—are expected to increase to 2,720,000 kilowatts by 1979; about 85% of this demand will be met by EDELCA.
PARTICIPATIONS totaling $1,225,000: by The
Marine Midland Trust Company of New York,
The Chase Manhattan Bank, Irving Trust Com
 

pany, New York Agency of The Royal Bank of
Canada, The Meadow Brook National Bank,
The First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company, and Dresdner Bank A.G.

NOTE A
Amounts in currencies other than United States
dollars have been translated into United States dollars:

G) In the cases of 63 members, at the par values
as specified in the “Schedule of Par Values”, published by the International Monetary Fund;

Gi) In the cases of the remaining 39 members
(Algeria, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Burundi,
Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile,
China, Colombia, Congo (Brazzaville), Congo
(Leopoldville), Dahomey, Gabon, Guinea, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Korea, Laos, Malagasy
Republic, Mali, Mauritania, Nepal, Niger, Paraguay, Peru, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanganyika, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia,
Uganda, Upper Volta, Viet-Nam and Yugoslavia],
at the rates used by such members in making payments of capital subscriptions to the Bank; and

(iii) In the case of Swiss francs, non-member
currency, at the rate of 4.2975 francs to 1 United
States dollar.

See also Notes B and C.

No representation is made that any currency held by
the Bank is convertible into any other currency at any
rate or rates.

NOTE B
These currencies of the several members, and the
notes issued by them in substitution for any part of
such currencies as permitted under the provisions of
Article V, Section 12, are derived from the portion of
the subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank which
is payable in the currencies of the respective members
(such portion being hereinafter called restricted currency). Such restricted currencies may be loaned by
the Bank, and funds received by the Bank on account
of principal of loans made by the Bank out of such
restricted currencies may be exchanged for other currencies or reloaned, only with the approval in each
case of the member whose restricted currency is in
APPENDIX G

volved; provided, however, that, if necessary, after
the Bank’s subscribed capital is entirely called, such
restricted currencies may, without restriction by the
members whose currencies are offered, be used or
exchanged for the currencies required to meet contractual payments of interest, other charges or amortization on the Bank’s own borrowings or to meet the
Bank’s liabilities with respect to contractual payments
on loans guaranteed by it.

Under Article I, Section 9, each member is required,
if the par value of its currency is reduced or if the
foreign exchange value of its currency depreciates to
a significant extent in its territories, to maintain the
value of the Bank’s holdings of its restricted currency,
including the principal amount of any notes substituted therefor, and the Bank is required, if the par
value of a member’s currency is increased, to return
to the member the increase in the value of such
restricted currency held by the Bank. To the extent
such restricted currencies are out on loan, the Bank
and the members are obligated to make such payments only when such restricted currencies are recovered by the Bank.

The equivalent of $18,253,358 is due from 2 members
in order to maintain the value of their restricted currencies as required under Article II, Section 9.

Some members have converted part or all of the
Bank’s holdings of their restricted currency into
United States dollars to be used and reused as United
States dollars in the Bank’s operations, subject to the
right of the Bank or the member to reverse the transactions at any time, with immediate effect as to dollars
then held by the Bank, and, as to dollars loaned, upon
repayment of the loans. Such dollars while held by
the Bank or on loan are not subject to the provisions
of Article II, Section 9. Such dollars held by the Bank
or repayable on loans are shown in these financial
statements under “United States dollars” and, where
relevant, as “unrestricted”’.INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT

Notes to Financial Statements

 

JUNE 30, 1964

NOTE A
Amounts in currencies other than United States
dollars have been translated into United States dollars:

(i) In the cases of 57 members, at the par values
as specified in the “Schedule of Par Values”, published by the International Monetary Fund;

Gi) In the cases of the remaining 36 members
[Algeria, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Burundi,
Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile,
China, Colombia, Congo (Brazzaville), Conga
(Leopoldville}, Dahomey, Gabon, Ivory Coast,
Kenya, Korea, Laos, Malagasy Republic, Mali,
Mauritania, Nepal, Niger, Paraguay, Peru,
Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanganyika,
Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Upper Volta, Viet-Nam
and Yugoslavia], at the rates used by such members in making payments of subscriptions to the
Association.

NoTE B

Pursuant to Article IV, Section 1 (a), these amounts
may be used by the Association for administrative
expenses incurred by the Association in the territories
of any Part II member whose currency is involved
and, insofar as consistent with sound monetary policies, in payment for goods and services produced in
the territories of such member and required for
projects financed by the Association and located in
such territories; and in addition when and to the
extent justified by the economic and financial situation of the member concerned as determined by
agreement between the member and the Association,
such currency shall be freely convertible or otherwise
usable for projects financed by the Association and
located outside the territories of the member.

NoTE C

The principal disbursed and outstanding on development credits and the accrued service charge are
expressed in terms of United States dollars of the
weight and fineness in effect on January 1, 1960 and
the equivalent is payable by the borrowers in currencies which the Association determines to be freely
convertible or freely exchangeable by the Association
for currencics of other members of the Association,
except that such amount would be reduced if (a)
there is a uniform proportionate reduction in the par
values of the currencies of all members of the International Monetary Fund or (b) the Association so
decides because of a substantial reduction in the value
of one or more major currencies of members. The
foregoing does not apply to a credit of $9,000,000
which is expressed and is repayable in legal tender
dollars.

Note D

Subscriptions and supplementary resources are expressed in terms of United States dollars of the weight
and fineness in effect on January 1, 1960.

NOTE E

Payment of this portion of the subscriptions of members, with the exception of $375,000, being the subscription of Luxembourg, is due on November 8, 1964
as follows: One and one quarter percent of the
subscription of each member is payable in gold or
freely convertible currency; eighteen percent of the
subscription of each member is payable (a) in gold or
freely convertible currency by Part 1 members and
(b) in the currency of the subscribing member by
Part II members. ‘The amount due from Luxembourg,
a Part I member, is payable in gold or freely convertible currency in three equal instalments on or
before November 8 in each of the years 1965, 1966
and 1967. In July 1964, Belgium became a Part I
member with a subscription of $8,250,000 payable on
the same terms and timing as the subscription of
Luxembourg.

NOTE F

These supplementary resources are to be paid by the
members in freely convertible currencies in three equal
instalments on or before November 8 in each of the
years 1965, 1966 and 1967. In July 1964, Belgium, in
addition to its subscription described in Note E,and
Kuwaitagreed to make supplementary resources available of $8,250,000 and $3,360,000 respectively, payable on the same basis as the above. The Board of
Governors has authorized the Association to accept
from four other Part | members supplementary resources aggregating $64,488,000 also payable on the
same basis as the above. In addition, in July 1964,
Sweden paid to the Association a further contribution
equivalent to $5.045.000.

NoTE G

Under Article IV, Section 2, each member is required,
if the par value of its currency is reduced or the foreign
exchange value of its currency has in the opinion of
the Association depreciated to a significant extent
within that member’s territories, to maintain the
value of the Association’s holdings of its ninety percent
currency, including the principal amount of any notes
substituted therefor, and the Association is required
if the par value of the member’s currency is increased,
or the foreign exchange value of the member’s currency has in the opinion of the Association appreciated
to a significant extent within that member’s territories, to return to the member the increase in the
value of such ninety percent currency held by the
Association; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall apply only so long as and to the extent that such
currency shall not have been initially disbursed or
exchanged for the currency of another member.

 

Supplementary resources of the Association have, by
agreement, the same respective rights and obligations
as to maintenance of value as are set forth in Article
TV, Section 2, of the Articles of the Association.INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

To
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
WASHINGTON, D. G.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in terms of
United States currency, the financial position of International Development Association at June 30,
1964, and the results of its operations for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year. Our examination
of these statements was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included review of the allocation of expenses incurred jointly with International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures
as we considered necessary.

WORLD BANK REGIONS, COUNTRY OFFICES, AND BORROWER ELIGIBILITY

The World Bank today operates out of more than 100 offices
worldwide. Increased presence in client countries is helping

the Bank to better understand, work more closely with, and
provide faster service to clients. Three-fourths of outstanding
loans are managed by country directors located away from the
Bank's Washington, DC, headquarters. Thirty-three percent of staff
are now based in country offices.

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2007 3ABOUT THE WORLD BANK

The World Bank comprises two institutions: the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and

the International Development Association (IDA). These
institutions—along with the International Finance Corporation
(IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA],
and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID)—make up the World Bank Group. Each
institution specializes in a different aspect of development,
but they all have the same goal: a world free of poverty.

The World Bank exchanges ideas with countries on which
policies are best suited to achieving their development goals and
provides them with technical and financial assistance. IBRD’s
clients are middle-income and creditworthy poorer countries,
while IDA focuses exclusively on the poorest countries.

The World Bank operates like a cooperative, with developing and developed country members functioning as share
4 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2007

holders. Their representatives, the Executive Directors, set
Bank policies and oversee its operations.

IBRD has 185 member countries. Since its inception in
1944, it has made loans amounting to $433 billion. IDA has
166 member countries. Since its inception in 1960, it has
made commitments amounting to $181 billion.

World Bank programs give high priority to sustainable
human and social development and to strengthened economic management, with an emphasis on inclusion, governance, and institution building. Grants and loans obtained
from cofinanciers and partnerships often complement
government funds and World Bank lending to make up the
total package of assistance to a country.

For additional information please see www.worldbank.org,
as well as the Guide to the World Bank at www.worldbank
.org/reference.MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD BANK
AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

Throughout this Report you will see what the work of the
World Bank Group means for countries and people striving
to overcome poverty in all regions, especially in Africa. The
World Bank Group is working with partners on more than
620 projects: to give both boys and girls a chance to learn;
offer health services to those in need of care; promote the
development of the private sector so as to put local savings
to work creating jobs and property for the poor; and build
infrastructure and secure, sustainable energy sources that
are prerequisites for growth. We also strive to strengthen
governance, institutions, and the rule of law so people have
a fair opportunity to forge a future for their families and
their countries.

The face of the World Bank is the rural electrification
project | visited in Vietnam that frees time for a girl to go
to school because she can now grind rice and maize with
a machine—and gives her light to study by. It is the publicprivate water partnership we helped finance in Senegal,
which pipes safe water and removes wastes, that is cutting
waterborne diseases and malaria while saving a valuable
resource that now meets the needs of almost a million people.
And it is the irrigation project we backed in Armenia that
enables a farmer to expand his apple orchards while promoting transparency in payments for government services.

During fiscal year 2007, the World Bank Group committed
$34.3 billion in loans, grants, equity investments, and guarantees to its members and to private businesses in member
countries—up $2.7 billion (7.8 percent) from fiscal year 2006.

The World Bank Group institutions contributing to this
financial outcome are: the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD], which provides financing,
risk management products, and other financial services to
members; the International Development Association (IDA),
which provides interest-free loans and grants to the poorest
countries; the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which
makes equity investments, and provides loans, guarantees
and advisory services to private-sector business in developing
countries; and the Bank Group's political risk insurance
agency, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Investment
Agency (MIGA).

IDA commitments were $11.9 billion, 25 percent higher
than the previous year, and the highest in IDA’s history. IBRD
commitments in fiscal year 2007 totaled $12.8 billion. IFC
committed $8.2 billion for private sector development in
developing countries, an all-time high, which topped last
year’s total by $1.5 billion—and $3 billion of the total went
to IDA countries. Of MIGA’s $1.4 billion in guarantees,

 

 

$387 million went to projects in IDA countries. MIGA’s exposure in IDA countries now stands at 41 percent of its portfolio.

In addition, IBRD carried out $5.4 billion in interest rate
and currency risk management transactions on behalf of its
members. This is an increase of more than three-fold over
totals for the past several years and highlights the expanding
portfolio of financial services we offer. Furthermore, IFC
mobilized an additional $3.9 billion through loan participations, structured finance, and parallel loans.

The World Bank Group can and should do much more.
Given the great needs among diverse developing countries,
the World Bank Group can make its capital, knowledge, and
expertise work for people by creating customized development solutions for all. We will be investing in practical plans
to move from poverty to prosperity. Working with partners
and supporters from around the world, guided by a commitment to results, we will strive to achieve the Millennium
Development Goals by 2015. This is the way we can advance
an inclusive and sustainable globalization.

The world has changed enormously since the World Bank
was created some 60 years ago. This unique and accomplished
institution of development, reconstruction, and finance not
only needs to adapt: it must find the ways to help all counries, particularly the poorest, to seize the benefits of changes
in the world economy while better managing the risks.

The World Bank Group needs to be a strategic partner
o clients, donors, and those that are both. It should be a
development innovator in fragile states and those struggling
‘0 come out of conflicts. It can be a designer and implementer
of local solutions to global challenges of the environment and
disease, while serving as a steward of our natural environment and a first responder to climate change. It must be a
acilitator of rules, institutions, and markets that can tap
rade and finance for people in developing countries seeking
ope, opportunity, and the dignity of personal enterprise.

This year has not been an easy one. Yet we are regaining
momentum and building energy. | have seen that the World
Bank Group's most valuable resource—the talented and
dedicated people who bring its work to life—are highly
motivated by the Bank’s core mission: to end poverty. They
are moving forward. It is a privilege to get to know them and
o work with them.

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2007 5THE BOARD OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

The Executive Directors are responsible for the conduct of the
Bank's general operations. They perform their duties under
powers delegated by the Board of Governors. As provided in
the Articles of Agreement, 5 of the 24 Executive Directors are
appointed by single countries having the largest number of
shares. The rest are elected by the other member countries,
which form constituencies in an election process conducted
every two years. The resident Board of Executive Directors [the
Board] represents the evolving perspectives of member countries
on the role of the Bank as well as its operational experience.

The Board considers and decides on the IBRD loan and
guarantee proposals and IDA credit, grant, and guarantee
proposals made by the Bank's President. Executive Directors
fulfill an important role in guiding the general operations of the
Bank and its strategic direction. They are also responsible for
presenting to the Board of Governors audited accounts, an
administrative budget, and an annual report (this report} on the
operations and policies of the Bank, as well as any other matters
that, in their judgment, require submission to the Board of
Governors. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) reports
directly to the Board with independent advice on the relevance,
sustainability, efficiency, and effectiveness of operations.

Executive Directors serve on one or more standing committees: Audit; Budget; Committee on Development Effectiveness (CODE); Committee on Governance and Administrative
Matters (COGAM); and Personnel. With the committees’ help,
the Board discharges its oversight responsibilities through indepth examinations of policies and practices. The Executive
Directors’ Steering Committee, an informal advisory body,
also meets regularly.

The Board's work remained closely aligned with the twin
pillars of the Bank’s strategic framework—promoting a
favorable investment climate and empowering poor people.

6 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2007

In March 2007, the Bank President initiated a broader look at

ADMINISTRATIVE BUDGET

The total administrative budget for fiscal 2007, reviewed by the
Budget Committee and approved by the Executive Directors,
was $2,119 million, net of reimbursements, including

$171.8 million for the Development Grant Facility and the
Institutional Grant Programs. The net administrative budget of
$1,591.3 million represented a 3.1 percent nominal increase
over the fiscal 2006 budget. In June 2007, the Executive Directors
approved a total administrative budget, net of reimbursements,
of $2,148.3 million for fiscal 2008.

INSPECTION PANEL

In fiscal 2007, the Inspection Panel received six requests for
inspection involving Bank projects in five countries. Since the
panel's establishment, 46 requests for inspection have been
received: 14 from Africa, 15 from Latin America and the
Caribbean, 11 from South Asia, 4 from East Asia and Pacific,
and 2 from Europe and Central Asia. Of the 46 requests, 41
were registered, and the panel has recommended investigations in 22 cases, 6 under the rules that applied before the

panel, and 16 since those clarifications were adopted. As of
June 2007, the panel was conducting three investigations.

The Inspection Panel provides a vehicle for private citizens,
especially poor people, to bring claims to the World Bank's
Board of Executive Directors, who then decide, on the recommendation of the panel, whether an investigation will take
place. The process for addressing claims has empowered and
given voice to people who may have been affected adversely
by Bank-financed projects.

Requests for inspection, management responses, panel
recommendations, panel investigation reports, and management recommendations for projects reviewed this fiscal year
can be found at www.worldbank.org/inspectionpanel.

RESIGNATION OF PRESIDENT AND SELECTION

OF NEW PRESIDENT

In April 2007, the Board was faced with a leadership crisis
that led to the resignation of the World Bank Group’s
President, Paul D. Wolfowitz. The Board has since unanimously confirmed Robert B. Zoellick as the Bank's 11th
President, as of July 1, 2007, for a five-year term.

 

The Independent Evaluation Group [IEG] is an independent unit within
the World Bank Group that assesses the relevance and impact of the
Bank Group's work to reduce poverty and improve people's lives in a
sustainable manner. It reports directly to the Executive Directors. IEG’s
goals are to contribute to the objective basis for assessing results, to
provide accountability in the achievement of development objectives,
and to share learning gained from experience. IEG makes its findings

available to the broader development community and the public at
large.

Summary highlights of IEG’s activities in fiscal 2007—in areas such as
infrastructure, clean energy, fragile states, rapid response, education,
governance, and anticorruption—are provided throughout this report.

8 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2007REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS, AND STAFF

To recruit and retain highly qualified staff, the World Bank Group has developed a compensation and benefits system designed
to be internationally competitive, to reward performance, and to take into account the special needs of a multinational and
largely expatriate staff. The Bank Group's staff salary structure is reviewed annually by the Executive Directors and, if warranted, is adjusted on the basis of a comparison with salaries paid by private financial and industrial firms and by representative public sector agencies in the U.S. market. After analyses of updated comparator salaries, the Board approved an average
increase in the salary structure of 3.5 percent for fiscal 2007, effective July 1, 2006, for Washington-based staff.

Executive Management

On June 25, 2007, the Executive Directors unanimously selected Robert B. Zoellick as President to take effect as of July 1, 2007.
His annual salary (net of taxes] is $420,930.* As of June 30, 2007, the annual salaries (net of taxes) of executive management of
the World Bank Group were as follows:

 

NAME AND POSITION SALARY ($)
Paul Wolfowitz, President 407,880?
Graeme Wheeler, Managing Director 324,610
Vincenzo La Via, Chief Financial Officer 324,610
Lars Thunell, Executive Vice President, IFC 324,610
Juan Jose Daboub, Managing Director 311,000
Marwan Muasher, Senior Vice President, External Affairs 295,000
Vinod Thomas, Director General, IEG 293,720
Ana Palacio, Senior Vice President and World Bank Group General Counsel 293,700
Yukiko Omura, Executive Vice President, MIGA 261,910

a. In addition, a supplemental allowance of $73,010 was paid to cover expenses. Effective July 1, 2006, the remuneration was adjusted by
the May-May Consumer Price Index for the Washington metropolitan area (4.2 percent]

Executive Directors

Upon the recommendation of the Board of Governors’ Committee on the Remuneration of Executive Directors, the Governors
approved the remuneration of Executive Directors and their Alternates effective July 1, 2006, to be as follows: the remuneration
of Executive Directors is $212,980 (net of tax}; the remuneration of Alternate Executive Directors is $184,240 (net of tax).

Staff Salary Structure (Washington, DC)
During the period July 1, 2006, to June 30, 2007, the salary structure (net of tax] for World Bank Group staff was as follows:

 

MARKET STAFF AT
GRADES MINIMUM ($) REFERENCE ($) MAXIMUM ($) REPRESENTATIVE JOB TITLES GRADE LEVEL (%]

K 260,260 295,140 324,610 Managing Director, Executive Vice President 0.1

Note: Because World Bank Group (WBG) staff, other than U.S. citizens, usually are not required to pay income taxes on their WBG compensation, the salaries are set on a net-of-tax
basis, which is generally equivalent to the after-tax take-home pay of the employees of the comparator organizations and firms from which WBG salaries are derived. Only a few staff will
reach the upper third of the salary range

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2007 9FISCAL YEAR OVERVIEW

The number of people living in extreme poverty was estimated to have dipped below one billion for the first time
since the World Bank began measuring poverty in 1990.

World Bank commitments totaled $24.7 billion in fiscal 2007.
This amount included loans, credits, guarantees, and grants,
and was 4 percent higher than total lending in fiscal 2006.
For details, see chapter 3 and the accompanying CD-ROM.

¢ IBRD committed $12.8 billion for 112 projects in fiscal
2007. This was a decline of 9 percent in the dollar amount
of commitments from fiscal 2006. For details, see
chapters 2 and 3 and the accompanying CD-ROM.
e IDA committed $11.9 billion for 189 operations in fiscal
2007. This was a record high for IDA, with commitments
25 percent higher in dollar terms than in fiscal 2006. For
details, see chapters 2 and 3 and the accompanying CDROM.
¢ Africa received the highest funding, at $5.8 billion, which
is a record for the region. For details, see chapter 2 and
the accompanying CD-ROM.
¢ India was the single largest borrower, with $3.8 billion in
commitments. Commitments to South Asia overall were
nearly 50 percent higher than in fiscal 2006. For details,
see chapter 2 and the accompanying CD-ROM.

 

The Bank delivered 531 economic and sector work and

430 technical assistance (nonlending) products in fiscal 2007.

For details, see chapter 3.

10 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2007

In its “Annual Report on Portfolio Performance,” the Quality
Assurance Group found that the share of well-performing
Bank projects at completion reached 81 percent in fiscal 2006,
a level unmatched in the past 25 years. For details, see
chapter 3.

The Independent Evaluation Group produced 13 major
evaluations reviewing the Bank’s performance on a range of
activities, including transport, agriculture in sub-Saharan
Africa, the Annual Review of Development Effectiveness, and
reviews of country assistance programs in Mali and Ukraine.
For details, see www.worldbank.org/ieg.

Representatives of donor countries, borrower countries, and
observers from other multilateral banks met to discuss the
fifteenth replenishment of IDA in Paris in March 2007, and
again in Maputo in June 2007. For details, see chapter 3.

The Executive Directors approved new strategies for financial
and private sector development; health, nutrition, and
population; and governance and anticorruption. For details,
see chapter 1.

A leadership crisis led to the resignation of the World Bank's
President, Paul D. Wolfowitz, effective June 30, 2007.

On June 25, 2007, the Board of Executive Directors unanimously selected Robert B. Zoellick as President to take effect
as of July 1, 2007.ADDRESSING POVERTY WORLDWIDEA CHANGING ENVIRONMENT

The World Bank's client countries experienced a remarkable
year, with average per capita gross domestic product (GDP)
rising an estimated 6 percent in 2006. Even more significant,
trends of sustained growth are emerging: annual per capita
GDP growth in developing countries has averaged 3.9 percent
since 2000, and 16 African countries—home to more than a
third of the region’s population—have enjoyed annual growth
of more than 4.5 percent over the past decade. This growth
has benefited the poor, with the number of people living in
extreme poverty dipping below 1 billion for the first time since
the Bank began measuring poverty, in 1990.

Clearly, developing economies are performing. Now is the
time to meet that performance with increased aid. Donor
countries have committed billions in debt relief and have met
emergencies with well-timed assistance, thereby making
an important contribution to the ability of poor countries to
achieve their development goals. Further support could go
beyond mitigating the burden of debt and disaster to enable
performers to invest more in priority areas such as infrastructure, education, and health.

For many low-income countries, the development finance
landscape has been transformed by unprecedented access
to private capital—though that access is still uneven, with the
poorest 51 countries receiving just 8 percent of the total in
2006. Meanwhile, traditional aid now comes from an abundance of donors, including some countries newly arrived at
lending, and still others, such as foundations or even individuals, with highly specific goals. Taken as a whole, these are
encouraging signs, especially when support aligns readily
with national priorities.

This transformation underscores the vital convening role
of the International Development Association, which serves
as a cornerstone of the international aid system in many
poor countries. IDA provides such countries with reliable aid

12 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2007

support and leverages the assistance of other donors for
coherent, country-owned programs and projects. IDA’s
efforts forge stronger partnerships between aid providers
and recipient countries, leading to better outcomes for the
poor.

The coming year will be crucial for IDA's clients, as donors
will be confirming their commitments to the 15th replenishment of IDA. IDA15 will provide resources to assist the world’s
poorest countries from July 2008 through June 2011—critical
years for developing countries trying to achieve the Millennium Development Goals {MDGs}. Given the long lag time
before development projects yield measurable results, IDA15
may be the last major opportunity for donors to support
developing-country efforts to make significant progress
toward achieving the MDGs by 2015.

For middle-income countries, access to market-based
financing and risk-management tools continued to improve
in fiscal 2007, as their costs of borrowing declined to near
all-time lows. These countries require development partners that are flexible and responsive and that can provide
a broad array of financing, risk- management, and creditenhancement products, provided quickly and at lower transaction costs. International financial institutions, including
the World Bank, must adapt to such changes in client
complexion and outlook and to the constant changes in the
global economic environment.

The World Bank uniquely must adapt to these changes
while staying loyal to its vision: a world free of poverty. It
pursues this end by focusing on its areas of comparative
advantage, supporting client countries’ pursuit of sustained
and equitable economic growth. The Bank’s support includes
knowledge services, financial services, and strategy and
coordination services. Additionally, the Bank advocates the
adoption of prodevelopment policies around the world, particularly in relation to trade.This report looks at the activities undertaken in the past
fiscal year in the fight against poverty. The report pays special
attention to Africa and focuses on five critical areas where
the Bank can have a distinct impact: health, education, and
gender; infrastructure and clean energy; financial and private
sector development; governance and anticorruption; and in
developing its strategy for middle-income countries.

HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND GENDER

Improvements in the areas of health, education, and gender
are fundamental to achieving the Bank’s mission: six of the
eight MDGs address them, and complex interrelationships
exist among the three. Progress in these areas requires
vigilance, especially in Africa, where each has been highlighted as a flagship area for Bank support, in accordance
with client country priorities.

Health, Nutrition, and Population

Across the world, poor people face high mortality rates,
malnutrition, and limited access to reproductive and other
basic health services. At the same time, millions fall into

THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS

 

poverty every year as a result of illness. Health conditions are
particularly dire in Africa, where no country is on track to
meet the child mortality MDG.

Recent years have seen massive increases in international
aid for health, with much of it targeted to specific diseases,
such as HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired
immune deficiency syndrome], tuberculosis, and malaria.
However, relatively few resources have been provided to
support health systems, and few institutions are in a position
to bring donors, single-cause funds, and other sources
together to help countries improve health outcomes. This is
an area to which the World Bank is strongly committed and
in which it has a comparative advantage. The Bank's updated
strategy in health, nutrition, and population (HNP), discussed
by the Board in April 2007, draws on the Bank’s long experience in health financing, health systems, and cross-sectoral
investments (box 1.1]. Under the new strategy, lending in HNP
will be even more closely tied to results than it has been in
the past. The Bank will work across sectors and engage with
a diverse group of actors to strengthen health systems and
interventions, a necessary step for achieving improved treatment
and prevention of any single disease. The Bank will also work

 

1. Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger
Halve the number of people in extreme poverty, and the number of people
who suffer from hunger, by 2015.

2. Achieve Universal Primary Education
Ensure by 2015 that all children will be able to complete a full course of
primary education.

3. Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women
Eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education by 2005,
and in all levels of education by 2015.

4. Reduce Child Mortality
Reduce by two-thirds the under-five mortality rate by 2015.

5. Improve Maternal Health
Reduce by three-quarters the maternal mortality rate by 2015.

6. Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases
Halt the spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other major diseases, and
begin to reverse the spread, by 2015.

7. Ensure Environmental Sustainability
Halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking
water by 2015.

8. Develop a Global Partnership for Development
Further develop an open, rule-based, predictable, nondiscriminatory
trading and financial system.

ADDRESSING POVERTY WORLDWIDE 13to prevent poverty resulting from illness and to improve governance, accountability, and transparency in the health sector.

Lending for HNP, including health financing, reached
$1.83 billion in fiscal 2007. Health systems performance was
a dominant theme in fiscal 2007, representing $739 million in
new lending. Support to population and reproductive health
programs totaled $303 million, and support to the treatment
and prevention of HIV/AIDS reached $300 million.

The Bank has long supported health-related projects in
countries such as Argentina, Ghana, Mozambique, and
Tanzania, where a wide range of lending approaches has been
used over time. Bank assistance has also had a positive effect
in postconflict countries (box 1.2]. For example, in Afghanistan
and Timor-Leste, armed conflict resulted in huge losses in
health personnel, infrastructure, and management capacity.
Consequently, the countries turned to civil society organizations to provide basic health services. As conflict died down,
both governments developed new strategies to integrate
public and nonstate health service providers using robust
monitoring and contracting approaches. Bank financing for
HNP and other sectors, as well as support for public financing reforms, helped the governments implement these

 

strategies. In Afghanistan, the immediate result has been

a fourfold increase in the use of health services in target
provinces. In Timor-Leste, the average use of health services
increased from one annual visit per person to at least twoand-a-half visits. Measles immunizations rose from 26 percent to 73 percent of children, and skilled attendance at birth
increased from 26 percent to 41 percent.

Most of the analytic work and technical assistance the
Bank provided in fiscal 2007 concentrated on health systems
issues. Two reports, Health Financing Revisited and Beyond
Survival, summarize global lessons in health financing and
provide policy recommendations based on the specific economic, political, and institutional conditions countries face.

Education

The World Bank is the world’s largest source of external
investment support for improving education in middle- and
low-income countries, having transferred about $40 billion

in loans and credits for education since it started lending to
the sector in 1963. This represents nearly 7 percent of total
lending over that 44-year period. As with health, the Bank has
a unique ability to consult with national governments, United

HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT: THE WORLD BANK'S STRATEGY FOR ACHIEVING HEALTH, NUTRITION, AND POPULATION RESULTS

 

The World Bank’s new strategy for health, nutrition, and
population aims squarely at helping developing countries
strengthen their health systems and ensure synergies
between those systems and priority programs (for example, programs focused on HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis,
nutrition, and reproductive health]. By strengthening health
systems, the strategy aims to boost economic growth, reduce
poverty caused by catastrophic illness, and provide cohesion
among the multiple health-related programs within client
countries.

The strategy underwent an extensive consultative process
with 9 client countries and 65 global partners, including civil
society organizations and bilateral and multilateral organiza
tions. The following strategic objectives emerged from that
process:

¢ Improve measurement and outcomes of health-related MDGs

« Prevent poverty caused by illness by improving financial
protection

¢ Support the contribution that good health and sound
health-system policy can make to economic growth

¢ Improve governance, accountability, and transparency in
the health sector

The new strategy maintains the Bank's unswerving commitment to achieving results on the ground and to improving the
health conditions of people in client countries, particularly

the poor and the vulnerable. (See www.worldbank.org/hnp.]

 

14 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2007Nations (UN] agencies, bilateral agencies, donors, civil society
organizations, and other stakeholders to support developing
countries in their efforts to provide education to all their citizens
as a means to empower them and to boost economic growth.

Education lending in fiscal 2007 reached $2 billion. The
Bank provided about $1.6 billion in IDA funding, an all-time
high. Aid to Africa—which had declined steadily over the past
five years to a low of $339 million in fiscal 2006—reached
$707 million, nearly all from IDA, in fiscal 2007.

The Bank approved 28 education projects in fiscal 2007.
These included $280 million for vocational and technical
education in India; nearly $250 million for two projects in
Nigeria aimed at increasing access and learning in primary
schools and at improving the quality of higher education;

RAPID RESPONSE

 

 

 

The Bank has responded to a growing number of emergency
situations in recent years. It has helped countries recover
from natural disasters, such as the 2004 tsunami in the Indian
Ocean and the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan; it has supported
reconstruction in postconflict situations; it has helped to avert
outbreaks of pandemics, such as the avian flu; and it has
responded to manmade disasters, such as oil spills. The 2006
report by the Independent Evaluation Group, Hazards of Nature,
Risks to Development, noted that although there have been
many successes, the Bank's response has often lacked the
speed and effectiveness that emergencies demand.

To address these issues, the Board approved a new policy
framework in February 2007 for rapid response to emergency and crisis situations. The new framework allows the
Bank to act more quickly by acknowledging the wide range of
situations encompassed by the terms crisis and emergency
and by simplifying procedures and requirements in emergency operations. The new framework addresses constraints
faced in the early [and often critical) stages of recovery and
establishes a basis for the Bank to work with countries to
reduce the risk of crises and disasters in the first place.

To support implementation of the new policy, the Bank
drew on staff from across the institution with experience
in emergency work. As soon as the new policy framework took effect, task teams began to implement it. The
new policy was first applied to imminent crises. The
Emergency Social and Urban Rehabilitation Project, in
the Democratic Republic of Congo, was the first project
to receive approval under the new policy. The project
addresses the escalating risk of crisis in that country.
Four other projects were subsequently approved under
the new policy in fiscal 2007.

At the global level, the Bank is working with the United
Nations on a framework fiduciary agreement to facilitate
World Bank-United Nations collaboration during crises and
emergencies. In addition, as part of the effort to reduce the
risk of disaster in high-risk countries, the Bank has joined
with other donors and the United Nations in creating the
Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery, which
will help countries develop and implement disaster riskmitigation strategies and will provide funds for reconstruction. [See www.worldbank.org/hazards.}

 

ADDRESSING POVERTY WORLDWIDE 15$150 million for postconflict support for education in the
Democratic Republic of Congo; and $80 million for decentralizing education in Kenya.

Because education's role in broadly shared growth is complex
and pervasive, 79 investment projects or development policy
operations approved in fiscal 2007 contain funding to support
education. For this same reason, the Bank's approach to education has often involved addressing problems outside education
that hinder development of the sector. Reducing or eliminating
school fees, addressing HIV/AIDS in schools, and devolving
decision making and funding to schools and parents are examples
of reform priorities that require a cross-cutting approach.

Seven low-income countries—Benin, Cambodia, Mali,
Mauritania, Mongolia, Mozambique, and Sierra Leone—
received a total of $265 million in grant support under the

 

Education for All Fast-Track Initiative (FTI) in fiscal 2007. The
FTI is a global partnership between donor and developing
countries that helps to provide increased, better coordinated,
and more effective aid to countries with sound education
plans. These grants were made under the FTI Catalytic Fund,
a multidonor trust fund managed by the Bank that provides
transitional financial assistance to countries whose education
sector plans have been endorsed under the FTI process but
that have difficulty mobilizing sufficient external funding.
Thirty-one countries are now endorsed by the FTI.

Fiscal 2007 saw other encouraging results. Worldwide, the
number of primary-school-age children out of school has
fallen from about 100 million in 2000 to an estimated 77 million in 2006, and the ratio of girls to boys in primary schools is
rising rapidly in many countries (box 1.3}. The greatest increases

PUTTING 550,000 MORE CHILDREN IN PRIMARY SCHOOL IN BURKINA FASO

 

Burkina Faso’s primary school enrollment rate was among
the lowest in the world in the 1990s. Enrollment was very
low in rural areas, where children, particularly girls, were
kept at home because of the distance to school, the high
cost of schooling, and the high opportunity costs for poor
families whose children contributed significantly to family
income.

To address the problem, IDA brought $32.6 million to a

$110 million program supporting the government's Basic
Education 10-Year Program. Just as significantly, it provided
a framework that harmonized support from all partners—
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, the European Commission,
France, the Netherlands, Sweden, UNICEF, and nongovernmental organizations—through a common-basket fund that
allowed effective allocation of project resources.

The first phase of the program, completed in fiscal 2007,
improved access to primary education in rural areas by
constructing and rehabilitating schools and financing

equipment and facilities. It also supported curriculum
development, teacher training, and capacity building within
the Ministry of Basic Education, paying particular attention to
inancial management, budgeting, procurement, monitoring,
evaluation, and donor coordination.

As a result of the program, an additional 550,000 children
ave since been enrolled in primary school. Gross enrollment rates nationwide increased to 62 percent (55 percent
or girls} in 2006, up from 42 percent (36 percent for girls) in
2000. In the 20 most underprivileged provinces, enrollment
rose to 47 percent [41 percent for girls} from 30 percent

24 percent for girls) over the same period.

DA will continue to support the government's 10-year
program to ensure that the foundations laid for the reform
will be strengthened over time. A Post-Primary Education
Project that builds on the current operation is being implemented to address access and equity in secondary education.
See www.worldbank.org/burkinafaso.}

 

 

16 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2007in enrollments have occurred in South Asia. Bangladesh has
raised gross primary enrollment rates to almost 100 percent
and has already met the MDG on gender parity in school
enrollment. These hopeful signs suggest that globalization
can work in support of shared growth in the countries that
continue to invest in education.

In addition to investment support, the Bank continues to
produce sector analyses and cross-cutting analytical reports
that raise local awareness and increase global knowledge.
More than 30 education sector papers or strategy documents were prepared in fiscal 2007, and numerous Poverty
Reduction Strategy Papers addressed education. Feedback from governmental counterparts and nongovernmental
actors indicates that the Bank's policy advice and global
knowledge base are at least as important as its financial
support.

A redoubling of efforts will be required in education in
fiscal 2008 and beyond. Only 25 of 81 IDA-eligible countries
have achieved or are on track to achieve universal completion
of primary school by 2015 (the second MDG]. Bank support for
reaching this goal, including support through the interagency
FTI, has mostly emphasized increased access, according to an
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) analysis from fiscal 2007.
Although the Bank was widely successful in increasing enrollment and access, problems with student dropout and learning
outcomes remained. IEG recommended that future Bank
support increase the emphasis on learning outcomes and on
improved system management and governance and that the
Bank work with FTI partners to reorient the initiative. Since
that evaluation, all new primary education projects have been
reviewed for attention to learning outcomes; programs of
analysis, training, and policy dialogue have been organized
around the theme of learning outcomes and assessment;
and the Bank has engaged its FT! partners in building
learning outcomes into the initiative. Measuring learning
results and benchmarking them against local and interna
tional standards will help link countries to the global
economy. (See www.worldbank.org/education.]

Gender Equality

The Bank has a strong comparative advantage in the promotion of gender equality. The Bank's analytical capacity puts

it in a good position to make the business case for gender
equality and to document how increased gender equality can
accelerate shared growth. Operationally, the wide sectoral
scope of the Bank’s lending means that it is able to take
advantage of many entry points—ranging from health and
education to financial markets and infrastructure—to promote
gender equality.

During fiscal 2007, the Bank adopted an action plan to
empower women economically. The plan, “Gender Equality
as Smart Economics,” launched operations in all developing
regions. These operations included new activities targeting
agriculture, private sector development, financial services,
and infrastructure to help increase the productivity and
earnings of women producers.

In Tanzania, where women have very poor access to
financial services, the plan has established a line of commercial credit for women through a local bank. The program is providing training to women to increase their
“bankability,” and it is supporting regulatory reforms
to give women better access to credit. This project and
others under the gender action plan can facilitate women’s
transition to good-quality employment; can increase the
number of women starting agribusinesses and engaging
in high-value agriculture; and can boost women’s access
to essential infrastructure services, particularly transport,
water, and energy.

The Multi-Country AIDS Project for Africa has focused
particular attention on addressing gender dynamics in its
response to the pandemic. In Chad, IDA funds a project
to reduce the transmission and socioeconomic impact of

ADDRESSING POVERTY WORLDWIDE 7HIV/AIDS by supporting education and income-generating
activities for women. In Rwanda, IDA has financed access to
antiretroviral care for 5,000 poor rural people, most of them
women. In Africa generally, IDA has financed services to
prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission for more than

1.5 million women and has helped distribute 1.3 billion male
and 4 million female condoms.

The focus of the Bank's Global Monitoring Report 2007 was
on gender equality and on the progress of member countries
in meeting the related official MDGs. The report identified
gaps and developed a set of complementary indicators to
strengthen gender-equality monitoring.

Financial support from the governments of Canada,
Denmark, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and the United
Kingdom continues to encourage innovation in the mainstreaming of gender issues in the Bank's work. (See www
.worldbank.org/genderequality.]

INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLEAN ENERGY

Infrastructure

Improving infrastructure in developing countries is key to
reducing poverty, increasing growth, and achieving the MDGs.
Leaders of developing countries often say they need not only
more and better infrastructure facilities and services but
infrastructure that is environmentally sound, socially accepted, and financially sustainable.

By building on the increased investment opportunities
available under the Infrastructure Action Plan and by integrating the lessons learned in its long involvement in infrastructure worldwide, the World Bank has remained a leader
in working with developing countries in this area. It assists
them in providing the basic sustainable infrastructure capacity
and services needed for permanent poverty reduction.

The Bank increased commitments involving infrastructure
to $9.9 billion in fiscal 2007, a 24 percent increase over the
previous year. Transport remained the largest component,
with $4.9 billion in lending (50 percent of the total), followed
by new water and sanitation commitments of $3.1 billion
(31 percent of the total).

The Bank supports activities in a wide range of infrastructure services, including energy, transport, water supply and

18 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2007

sanitation, urban services, land use management, and
information and communication technologies. A key area of
involvement in the last year has been the promotion of clean
energy investments to help the international community
deal with growing threats from global warming and climate
change [see “Clean Energy,” below, and box 1.4).

The Bank provides financial assistance for investment
projects; leverages financing from donors and the private
sector; and engages in policy dialogue and provides adviceon sector reforms, working with country partners to build and
strengthen institutions. The Bank's infrastructure agenda is
particularly relevant to Africa, where 300 million people lack
access to improved water sources, 450 million people lack
adequate sanitation services, and transport costs are among
the highest in the world.

The continued growth in lending was accompanied by an
organizational realignment that saw infrastructure units within
the Bank integrated with units working on the environment,
agriculture and rural development, and social development.
The result was the creation of a robust Sustainable Development Vice Presidency charged with ensuring that Bank
infrastructure programs yield the kinds of environmentally
and socially sustainable programs that countries need and
request.

A report produced by the former infrastructure unit—
Infrastructure at the Crossroads: Lessons from 20 Years of
World Bank Experience—foreshadowed the integration by
exploring the importance of integrating environmental and
social dimensions into project identification, preparation,
appraisal, and supervision, and of allocating sufficient
resources to mitigate any adverse impacts of development.

ADDRESSING THE RISK OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN KENYA

 

 

IEG has been actively reviewing the Bank’s work in infrastructure in fiscal 2007. A recent IEG evaluation of Bank
assistance to the transport sector concluded that past
performance has generally been effective but that the focus
on rural and intercity roads is insufficient because of the
rapidly growing impact of urbanization and globalization.
More emphasis needs to be given to the reduction of urban

 

The number of people affected by droughts and floods in
Kenya is doubling every decade. To help poor people deal
with the impact of such climatic shocks, IDA funded two
phases of the Arid Lands Resource Management Program.
The program has been successful in addressing short-term
impacts of climate variability and is now focusing on
addressing the longer-term impacts of climate change.

Climate models project a substantial increase of up to

5 degrees Celsius in the annual average temperature for
Kenya by the end of the century. While uncertainties remain
regarding the changes in average rainfall, projections clearly
indicate a growing risk of both dry spells and intense

precipitation events. Recognizing this, IDA provided an
additional $60 million in financing in fiscal 2007 to deepen
and broaden the government's efforts to address climate
variability, and the Global Environment Facility is contributing an additional $5 million in fiscal 2008 to deal with these
risks. The next phase aims to increase institutional capacity
to plan for climate change by improving information flows
and analytical capacity; to promote public and private
investment through incentives for appropriate investment;
and to increase community resilience by piloting and
demonstrating alternative livelihood options through
community-based microprojects. (See www.worldbank.org/
kenya.)

 

ADDRESSING POVERTY WORLDWIDE 19traffic congestion, vehicle emissions, and accidents. IEG
also looked at management of agricultural water. Effective
management is vital for feeding growing populations and for
managing competition from urban regions for limited water
resources. IEG called for greater attention to the role of
agricultural policy and trade in alleviating regional water
shortages, and it encouraged the Bank to demonstrate the
impact of sound agricultural water management on poverty
reduction, employment, and health. [See www.worldbank
.org/infrastructure.]

Clean Energy

Increasing access to safe, modern, and economical energy in
developing countries, and working to ensure that this energy
is as clean as possible, is a major and growing field of

activity for the Bank. As a leading international organization
with the financial, technical, and human capacity to work
throughout the developing world, the Bank is in a unique position to help countries accelerate their use of clean energy for
sustainable development. The Bank has consistently surpassed the target it set for itself in 2004 to increase its annual
investments in energy efficiency and new renewable energy by
an average of 20 percent between fiscal years 2005 and 2009.
In the first two years of that commitment, investments in new
renewable energy and energy efficiency totaled $1.13 billion,
more than double the target of $552 million over the two
years.

Additionally, the Bank is developing a Clean Energy
Investment Framework, which addresses three interrelated
issues: accelerating investments that help increase supplies
of clean energy for development and improve access to affordable energy for the poor, particularly in Africa; promoting the
transition to a low-carbon economy; and assisting developing
countries as they adapt to the inevitable impact of climate
variability and change.

Total energy support from all sources—including the Bank
Group, the Carbon Finance Unit, and the Global Environment
Facility—is expected to exceed $10 billion in the three-year
period beginning in fiscal 2006, up from $7 billion over the
previous three years. Furthermore, an action plan in support

20 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2007

of the Clean Energy Investment Framework will encourage
the expansion of African initiatives that aim to increase the
number of households with access to modern energy from
25 percent today to 35 percent by 2015 and to 47 percent by
2030. The plan also aims to support the transition to a lowcarbon economy—especially in Brazil, China, India, Mexico,
and South Africa—by increasing analytical, knowledge, and
investment support. The plan also seeks to assist countries
as they adapt to climate variability and change by providing
for analytical work and for development of risk-management
instruments and other tools and methodologies. The goal is
not just to increase investments but to “climate proof” them
as well.

IEG assessed a subset of the Bank’s clean energy
portfolio—that is, new and renewable energy—in fiscal 2007
and found its work responsive to the needs of developing
countries and in agreement with the Bank's overall energy
strategy. In its review, IEG recommended that the Bank
continue to support investment climates conducive to commercialization of new and renewable energy and to make
allowances for the long periods often required for adoption
of renewable energy sources. IEG further recommended
that the Bank strengthen the monitoring and evaluation of
its renewable energy projects. The review encouraged the
Bank to support new and renewable energy in country
and energy sector strategies. (See www.worldbank.org/
infrastructureandcleanenergy.)

FINANCIAL AND PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

The financial and private sectors play a central role in
meeting the World Bank Group’s development mission.
Deep, efficient, and well-regulated financial markets and a
good legal and regulatory environment for the private sector
give firms—from microenterprises to multinationals—the
opportunity to invest productively, create jobs, and grow.
Well-functioning markets play a key role in helping poor
people rise out of poverty by leveling the playing field of
opportunity for would-be entrepreneurs and employers and
by providing poor households with improved opportunities
to earn incomes, save, obtain credit, and buffer themselves
against hard times. Efficient markets are especially neededin Africa, where financial and private sector development

is uneven; the burden of business regulation is excessive;
access to finance is limited, especially in rural areas; and
financial intermediation is less widespread than in any other
region in the world.

Until this year, the Bank maintained separate networks for
private sector and financial sector development. In view of the
close ties between the two, the networks were merged in fiscal
2007 to create a central vice presidency for Financial and
Private Sector Development (FPD]. FPD is a joint Bank-IFCMIGA vice presidency, and the Vice President leads the coordination of Bank and IFC technical assistance to governments in
support of financial and private sector development. The new
vice presidency focuses on creating the institutional foundations for effective markets, promoting open and competitive
markets, and supporting social safety nets using market-based
approaches.

The Board discussed a new financial strategy in April 2007.
The strategy identifies important changes in the Bank Group’s
business environment that necessitate changes in its strategic focus, in the model for its advisory services, and in the
allocation of Bank and IFC support. The Bank Group has
extensive country and global knowledge of the microfoundations of effective financial markets and institutions. Its
investments and advisory work offer unique insights on how
financial issues play out in sectors ranging from agriculture
to health care. The Bank Group is thus well-placed to see
all aspects of financial reform within the broader economic
development agenda. This expertise enables it to engage
at a practical level with countries in reform and to provide
a development voice in international standard-setting
bodies. In keeping with this comparative advantage, areas
of special focus going forward are the development of
market infrastructure (such as contract rights and enforcement, payments systems, credit information systems, and
disclosure standards]; prudential oversight (compatible
with better risk management and wider access to financial
services}; and targeted initiatives to improve access to
finance for the underserved and to develop domestic capital
markets.

 

Using information—rather than loans or conditionality—to
promote change, the Doing Business report, a joint Bank-IFC
publication that is published annually, informs governments
in 175 economies on how regulations help or hinder businesses in their countries. Since the project's inception in
2003, more than 70 regulatory reforms have been inspired or
informed by Doing Business, making it easier to start, run,
or close down businesses around the world. In addition to
the Doing Business report, a series of subnational reports
published in fiscal 2007 covered states and cities in Bangladesh,
Brazil, India, Mexico, and Pakistan.

Complementing the Doing Business analysis are enterprise surveys, through which the Enterprise Analysis unit
seeks to obtain firm-level views on constraints to doing
business. By the end of fiscal 2007, the unit had surveyed
65,000 firms in more than 90 countries. Additionally, the unit
piloted a new instrument in fiscal 2007 to survey businesspeople in the retail, microenterprise, and information technology sectors in India.

The Bank continues to assess corporate governance
and to assist countries in improving their corporate governance practices. In fiscal 2007, it completed nine corporate
governance reviews, including four corporate governance
Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes, four

ADDRESSING POVERTY WORLDWIDE 21reviews of governance at state-owned enterprises, and one
review of corporate governance in the banking sector.

Fourteen financial sector assessments were completed
under the joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund
Financial Sector Assessment Program in fiscal 2007, including
six second-round assessments (updates). To perform assessments, staff from the Bank and the Fund—assisted by experts
fromm cooperating official agencies—conduct a comprehensive
peer review of a country’s financial system. This review helps
countries prioritize appropriate policy responses to discovered
vulnerabilities. The assessment teams also highlight opportunities for improving the sector's ability to promote sound
economic development. The pipeline for fiscal 2008 indicates
that demand for the program continues unabated.

During fiscal 2007, FPD established a program to develop
financial markets that would help households deal with risk.
The program—Financial Markets for Social Safety Nets—
addresses housing finance, funded pensions, and insurance.
The housing finance unit helped increase access to housing
finance for lower-income households and expanded residential mortgage markets through loans, grants, and advisory
services in all regions. The pension unit prepared reports on
the Brazilian and Czech pension systems, which the relevant

22 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2007

 

governments can use to strengthen the case for reform. The
insurance unit supports the provision of health, life, livestock,
and crop insurance to the poor; such programs are already
active in Africa, East Asia, and South Asia. The Financial
Markets for Social Safety Nets Program is currently supervising $2.5 billion in Bank loans and is supporting preparation of
new loans worth $1.5 billion.

FPD continues to invest in Web sites, training programs,
case studies, and how-to guides in order to share knowledge.
Five practitioner toolkits were published in fiscal 2007 on
licensing, alternative dispute resolution, public-private
dialogue, inspections, and business registration.

FPD also partners with institutions outside the World
Bank Group to further its mission. The Foreign Investment
Advisory Service (FIAS]—funded by the Bank, IFC, and MIGA,
together with several donors—helps developing countries
improve their business environments in order to increase
private sector activity and investments with positive development impact (also see page 62). The Consultative Group to
Assist the Poor—a 33-member, independent institution
housed at the World Bank—works with financial institutions,
ratings agencies, governments, funders, and others to
promote microfinance. FPD also promotes better corporate
governance in private sector companies through the Global
Corporate Governance Forum. This multidonor trust fund
was cofounded by the World Bank Group and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
to promote local, regional, and global initiatives that improve
the institutional framework and practices of corporate
governance. FPD manages the Financial Sector Reform and
Strengthening Initiative (FIRST), which donors pledged to
continue supporting through 2012. FIRST promotes stable,
deep, and diverse financial sectors by providing grants.
Since it was set up in 2002, the initiative has supported
about 220 technical assistance projects in the financial
sector.

The Bank sharpened its focus on fighting money laundering and the financing of terrorism in Africa this fiscal year.

A parliamentarian forum, organized with the Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption, providedparliamentarians—the majority from Africa—with a forum in
which to discuss challenges associated with fighting corruption, money laundering, and terrorist financing. The Bank also
funded several multiyear comprehensive technical assistance
programs in Africa that seek to develop systems that protect
market integrity without hampering access to finance. (See
www.worldbank.org/finance.}

STRENGTHENING GOVERNANCE AND REDUCING
CORRUPTION

Improving governance and fighting corruption helps countries to better deliver basic services and to create growth and
employment opportunities for the benefit of the poor. This
work is therefore fundamental to the Bank’s mission. In March
2007, the Board unanimously endorsed a new strategy on

 

Bank engagement on governance and anticorruption. Under
this strategy, the Bank will expand and strengthen its support
for improving governance and curbing corruption in order to
fight poverty; improve the delivery of services; strengthen the
environment for private investment; and foster economic
growth at the project, country, and global levels (box 1.5).

Activities at the Project Level

Governance and anticorruption are being addressed at the
project level across the Bank's portfolio, including in public
sector reform, infrastructure, health, extractive industries,
and the financial sector. In fiscal 2007, World Bank support
to governance was $3.8 billion—$3.4 billion to public sector
governance and $424 million to support the rule of law. This
comprised 15 percent of Bank lending.

THEMES OF THE BANK’S NEW GOVERNANCE AND ANTICORRUPTION STRATEGY

 

Agreement on the Bank's governance and anticorruption
strategy was the result of a systematic consensus-building
process. A draft strategy was presented to the World BankInternational Monetary Fund Development Committee at the
Annual Meetings in Singapore in September 2006. Between
November 2006 and January 2007 the Bank held consultations with a range of stakeholders—including governments,
civil society, the private sector, and multilateral and bilateral
development partners—in 35 developing countries and

12 donor countries. The Bank also participated in four global
events and solicited online feedback, reaching more than
3,200 stakeholders worldwide.

Key messages from these consultations included the following:

¢ Stay engaged, even in poorly governed settings

¢ Engage not just with governments but with a range of
stakeholders, including legislatures and the judiciary,
the private sector, civil society, and the media

Strengthen country systems—such as public financial

management, procurement, regulatory, legal, and

administrative frameworks—to fight corruption

¢ Increase the emphasis on disclosure, participation, and
third-party monitoring of Bank operations

* Harmonize the Bank's actions with those of donors and
other actors

e Enhance monitoring and evaluation of the Bank's govern
ance and anticorruption activities through the use of

disaggregated or “actionable” indicators of governance

This process brought about a strategy that identifies mechanisms to build transparent, accountable, and capable states;
outlines instruments to improve monitoring and curb corruption in projects the Bank funds; harmonizes the Bank's
efforts with those of other development partners; and
encourages collaboration with the range of development
actors. (See www.worldbank.org/governance.])

 

ADDRESSING POVERTY WORLDWIDE 23Assistance for governance includes support for increasing
transparency in public financial management, strengthening
tax and customs administration, enhancing civil service
performance, supporting legal and judicial reforms, and
enabling local and central governments to deliver services
more effectively and with greater accountability to local
communities. A project in Afghanistan is funding improvements in procurement and financial management. In
Cambodia, the Bank is supporting more transparent civil
service pay structures. In the difficult postconflict environment of Liberia, the Bank, under the multidonor Governance
and Economic Management Action Plan, helped streamline
budget execution processes and fiduciary controls while
building capacity. By providing Institutional Development
Fund (IDF) grants, the Bank has helped strengthen the

capacity of Mexico's Federal Institute for Access to Information.

IDF grants have also allowed the Slovak Republic to redesign
and streamline the judicial system and increase access to
justice.

The Department of Institutional Integrity (INT) investigates
allegations of corruption involving Bank operations and
possible staff misconduct. The Bank offers multiple outlets
for reporting allegations of fraud, corruption, and other
misconduct in Bank-financed projects, including an international hotline (+1-800-831-0463). In fiscal 2007, INT released
the Integrity Report of the World Bank Group, Fiscal Years
2005-2006, which details actions the Bank has taken in
investigating fraud, corruption, and other misconduct over

24 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2007

that period. The programmatic elements of a new Voluntary
Disclosure Program were approved by the Board in August
2006 to elicit voluntary cooperation in the fight against
corruption from firms that have previously engaged in
wrongdoing. Information on the companies and individuals
the Bank has sanctioned is publicly available on the Bank's
Web site.

An independent panel was established to review INT’s
roles, responsibilities, and working relationships as part of
the Bank’s governance and anticorruption strategy.

Activities at the Country Level
Improving governance has become a component of the Bank’s
country assistance strategies (CASs] in most countries, and
it is a central element in some, including those of Albania,
Bangladesh, Indonesia, and several countries in Africa. Bank
support for governance is channeled through a mix of lending,
grant, analytical, and advisory instruments.

Consistent with its heightened focus on governance,
IDA makes its allocations based in large part on country
performance ratings, and two-thirds of the value of this rating
is based on a country’s governance. Research over the past
two decades has shown that governance has a strong impact
on both development performance and aid effectiveness.
The global commitment to reducing poverty by increasing
aid—supported by IDA—is based on the principle of mutual
accountability: more aid is provided the greater the effectiveness of how aid is used. Aid is best increased using recipientcountry systems for public policy making, budgeting, and
service provision.

The World Bank Institute, the knowledge-sharing and
learning arm of the World Bank, promotes the Bank’s
governance and anticorruption agenda through its Global
Governance Program. The program delivers courses and
seminars, provides governance advisory services, and carries
out operational research on various aspects of governance.
These activities and diagnostic tools help support action
planning for in-country reform. In fiscal 2007, the program
published an updated set of governance indicators for
213 countries and territories. In partnership with bilateral
agencies, local authorities, and civil society, the program is
supporting in-depth governance and anticorruption diagnostic
studies in Benin, Burundi, El Salvador, and Haiti; it is planning
to complete studies in Kenya and Nigeria; and it has received
preliminary requests for diagnostic-related assistance from
11 other client countries.

IEG finds that the bulk of the Bank’s assistance in governance and anticorruption has taken the form of reform programs in public administration and public financial management. This assistance has often improved the quality of public
sector management processes without translating into
improvements in the perceived quality of governance. Yet
recent progress in Eastern and Central Europe shows that it
is possible to raise perceived quality in a limited time when
there is strong country commitment to doing so. The IEG evaluation suggests that public sector reform initiatives have not
always been aligned with political circumstances, focusing on
new legislation and institutions while overlooking the enforcement dimension. Reform initiatives have also tended to
overlook the interface between the public and the private
sectors even though regulatory reforms have often been
effective against corruption.

Activities at the Global Level

The Bank is expanding partnerships in a number of joint
initiatives to strengthen governance. It is an active participant
in promoting the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery

of Foreign Public Officials (1997), the Forest Law Enforcement
and Governance Ministerial Processes (from 2001], the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (2002), and the

United Nations Convention against Corruption (2003). It works
closely with several international anticorruption organizations
and networks, including the Financial Action Task Force, the
Partnership for Transparency Fund, the OECD Development
Assistance Committee [DAC], and Transparency International.
In fiscal 2007, the Bank collaborated with OECD-DAC Govnet
to prepare an issues paper that sets out an agenda for
engaging in global collective action to improve poor governance, for conducting joint corruption assessments, and

for leveraging comparative strengths for a coordinated
response to addressing corruption. (See www.worldbank
-org/governance and www.worldbank.org/integrity.]

THE STRATEGY FOR MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES

The 79 IBRD-eligible countries, most of them middle-income
countries, are home to more than 70 percent of the world’s
population living on less than $2 a day. Improving assistance
to these countries is thus critical to reducing poverty. For
this reason, at its September 2006 Annual Meetings, the
World Bank—with the encouragement of its shareholder
governments—made a commitment to strengthening IBRD’s
effectiveness in partnering with middle-income countries to
achieve better development outcomes and to collectively
address regional and global concerns.

Middle-income countries have substantially improved the
quality of their economic management in recent years. Access
to market-based financing and risk-management tools has
increased, and sovereign financing costs have declined to
near all-time lows. But challenges remain. Capital market
access remains concentrated in a few countries, and the cost
of borrowing is typically much higher than that offered by
multilateral development banks. Income inequality and large
pockets of poverty persist, exacerbated by unevenness in
access to education, physical infrastructure, and other public
services. Many middle-income countries also face other
persistent problems that cannot be solved in the short term.
Solving these problems will require strengthening public
institutions and improving the business environment and
competitiveness of these countries.

Middle-income countries are repositories of extensive
knowledge about and experience with development issues,

ADDRESSING POVERTY WORLDWIDE 25and they increasingly view themselves as partners, rather
than as clients, of the Bank. Many promote development in
other countries through foreign direct investment, bank lending,
remittances, and even development assistance. Some contribute to IDA and may also partner in arrears clearance and debtreduction exercises that benefit the world’s poorest countries.

Some middle-income countries are also playing an
increasingly important role in the governance of the global
economy, helping develop the global agenda on issues such
as trade and climate change. Some are delivering global
public goods: combating infectious diseases, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and preserving biodiversity.

Middle-income countries want the Bank to be more flexible
and responsive; to offer a broader array of financing, riskmanagement, and credit-enhancement products; and to
reduce turnaround times and transaction costs. Although
lending and knowledge products have traditionally been
offered together, these countries want more sharply focused
and higher-quality knowledge services that are not tied to
financing. They also want to make more extensive use of the
Bank's convening capacity and experience in framing strategy
and assembling portfolios of expertise and finance from
multiple sources to help address collective issues.

26 THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2007

To meet client countries’ needs, the Development
Committee strongly endorsed a new strategy crafted by the
Bank that will improve performance in each of the Bank’s
three business lines: knowledge services, financial services,
and strategy and coordination services.

In knowledge services, the Bank is seeking to leverage
its research and expert services at the sectoral, country,
and global levels through project cycle work, analytic work,
training, institutional capacity building, technical assistance,
and other advisory activities. It is also seeking to engage
closely with national think tanks and other international
organizations on knowledge exchange.

In financial services, the Bank is considering a full menu of
financing and credit-enhancement and risk-management
tools that can be offered to sovereign and nonsovereign
entities.

In strategy and coordination services, the Bank will continue
to offer its convening capacity and global reach to support
country strategy work, including policy dialogue and delivery
of expertise to promote growth and reduce poverty, and to
address the provision of priority global and regional public
goods. (See www.worldbank.org/middleincomecountries.}REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES V4The past decade has witnessed growing diversity in income
levels and growth across Africa. Sixteen countries grew by
more than 4.5 percent a year over this period, and several of
them [including Ghana, Mozambique, Senegal, Tanzania, and
Uganda] also diversified their economies and exports. The
fastest-growing group of non-oil-producing African countries,
which together represent 36 percent of the population in
Africa, grew at an average rate of 5.5 percent. In contrast, the
13 slowest-growing countries, which represent 20 percent

of the region's population, saw average growth of only

1.3 percent. Growth for the region as a whole reached an
estimated 5.3 percent in 2006.

Solid growth has helped to improve human development
outcomes, especially in primary education. Gross primary
school enrollment rates in the region rose from 72 percent in
1991 to 96 percent in 2004. Health outcomes are more varied,
but they, too, are improving in many countries, and progress in
preventing and treating malaria and HIV/AIDS has accelerated.

Despite these positive signs, Africa is not growing rapidly
enough to substantially reduce income poverty. The World

AFRICA FAST FACTS

Bank is well positioned to mobilize private and public development finance to increase annual growth to 7 percent, the
minimum necessary to have a significant impact on poverty
reduction.

WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE
The Bank is the largest provider of development assistance
to Africa, with a record $5.8 billion in credits, grants, and
guarantees in fiscal 2007. In total, the Bank approved
93 projects, up more than 20 percent from fiscal 2006. It
also continued its nonlending activities, completing 194
analytic and advisory services. Sixteen African countries
benefited from the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative in
fiscal 2007, and another 17 will become eligible when they
reach their completion points under the Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries Initiative [see “Debt Relief,” chapter 3).
Over the past two years, the Bank's strategy for assisting
Africa has been implemented under the Africa Action Plan
(box 2.1]. The plan—based on accelerating shared growth,
building capable states, sharpening the focus on results, and

strengthening the development partnership—has already had
positive impacts. For example, in fiscal 2007, Ghana and
Tanzania were ranked among the top 10 countries reforming
the climate for doing business; with Bank Group support,
Madagascar moved up eight places in the global rankings for
ease of starting a business. Such successes result primarily
from strengthened commitment by African countries to
reforms, as well as from strengthened collaboration among
IDA, IFC, and MIGA in private sector development, infrastructure, and skills development.

Nearly 40 percent of Africa's population lives in landlocked
countries, many of which are also resource rich. The continent is also highly segmented geographically, and it has
the highest density of countries of any developing region.
Regional projects are therefore needed to close the infrastructure gap. The West Africa gas pipeline and the Eastern
Africa Submarine Cable System—both of which are publicprivate partnerships supported by the Bank Group—are
landmarks in regional approaches to relieving infrastructure
bottlenecks. The Multi-Country AIDS Project for Africa,
another Bank-supported regional program, operates in 31
African countries. It has reached 173 million people with

THE AFRICA ACTION PLAN

 

prevention messages and has helped prevent mother-to-child
transmission of HIV/AIDS among 1.5 million women.

The Africa Catalytic Growth Fund (ACGF), which the
World Bank established in March 2006, provides rapid,
targeted support to countries with credible programs for
accelerating growth, reducing poverty, and attaining the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The fund is highly
selective, focusing on a few countries at a time in which an
infusion of capital can augment the impact of IDA assistance to produce results. The Trust Fund Agreement for
the ACGF was signed in August 2006. Three projects were
selected to begin in fiscal 2007. Each project falls within
one of three work areas supported by ACGF—highperforming countries, transformation countries, and
regional integration—and each addresses a hard-to-reach
MDG—water supply and sanitation in Mozambique, child
mortality in Sierra Leone, and HIV/AIDS prevention and
treatment in the Horn of Africa.

 

OUTLOOK FOR AFRICA
African policies and institutional arrangements have improved substantially over the past decade, particularly in

 

In March 2007, the World Bank’s Executive Directors
discussed an assessment of the first 18 months of implementing the Africa Action Plan. Progress was rated broadly
satisfactory, with results appearing faster than expected in
developing the private sector, closing the infrastructure gap,
and addressing HIV/AIDS and malaria, areas in which the
Bank Group has also increased its support.

Despite the plan's general success, however, its impact
would have been even greater if it had aimed to achieve
fewer objectives and had focused more sharply on results.
Going forward, the Bank will therefore concentrate on eight
key “flagship” business lines: strengthening the private

sector, increasing the economic empowerment of women,
building skills for increased competitiveness, raising
agricultural productivity, improving access to and the
reliability of clean energy, expanding and upgrading road
networks and transit corridors, increasing access to safe
water and sanitation, and strengthening health systems to
prevent and treat malaria and HIV/AIDS. The country-based
model that guides IDA partnership efforts and country
strategies will be strengthened. Three cross-cutting areas
will support this effort: building more capable and accountable governments, improving environmental management,
and strengthening the development partnership.

macroeconomic management and trade policy, according to
the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
ratings. Africa now needs to sustain such gains by continuing
to improve the policy environment, in particular by ensuring
macroeconomic stability and improved market efficiency.
Doing so will require greater openness to trade as well as
the formation of strong market institutions. Removing
behind-the-border constraints and establishing a procompetitive
domestic business environment would enhance international
competitiveness and strengthen domestic capacity to respond
to the changing demands of the global economy [box 2.2).
African countries continue to benefit from increased
aid effectiveness, in keeping with the March 2005 Paris
Declaration. The declaration calls on all development partners
to ensure that aid is coordinated among donors, that donor

TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NEW SOUTH-SOUTH CHANNELS

agencies harmonize their requirements to minimize transaction costs, and that aid matches the country’s development
needs. Countries have taken the lead in developing baselines
and action plans for implementing the declaration with
development partners.

Africa has shown that it can sustain shared economic
growth. In supporting African governments and people, the
World Bank continues to play a pivotal role in advocating the
need to increase aid flows to Africa and for African goods to
have better access to world markets. The Bank will increase
the leverage of IDA by using the Bank Group’s analytic skills
and operational and country knowledge to identify areas in
which an infusion of sequenced and predictable financing
can help support results-oriented national programs. (See
www.worldbank.org/afr.]

OF TRADE AND INVESTMENT

 

 

Trade and investment flows between Africa and Asia—SouthSouth commerce—have risen dramatically since 2000. According to Africa's Silk Road, published by the World Bank in
2007, Africa's exports to Asia today are almost on par with
Africa's traditional commerce with the United States and the
European Union. Asia’s exports to Africa—which are increasing at a rate of about 18 percent a year—are growing more
rapidly than exports to any other region. Asian foreign direct
investment in Africa is also soaring.

With this newest phase in world trade and investment,
Africans cannot afford to be left behind, especially if
opportunities for trade and investment with traditional

partners continue to be limited. Trade between Africa and
Asia's two largest countries, China and India, represents
an enormous opportunity because it involves far more than
natural resources and is opening the way for Africa to
become a competitive processor of goods and services to
these countries. But for Africa to proactively seize these
opportunities within the developing world, it is imperative
that countries pursue rigorous reforms not only at their
borders but, more important, “behind their borders.”

In particular, they must adopt reforms that strengthen
domestic governance, foster competition among domestic
businesses, and create flexible and mobile labor and capital
markets.

REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES

31EAST ASIA

—

Growth in the World Bank's active client countries in the East
Asia and Pacific region accelerated from 9 percent in 2005 to
9.5 percent in 2006. The most rapidly growing country in the
region is China, which grew 10.7 percent in 2006—the fourth
consecutive year it has grown more than 10 percent. Cambodia,
the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, and Vietnam
also grew rapidly, increasing their output by 7.5-10.5 percent.
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand grew at
more moderate but still healthy annual rates of 5-6 percent.
Papua New Guinea and some of the Pacific Islands also saw
a pickup in growth, in part as a result of higher commodity
prices. Political or civil unrest undermined the outlook in
Timor-Leste and Tonga.

Poverty continued to decline in the region, with the number
of people living on less than $2 a day falling to 550 million in
2006, or less than 30 percent of the region’s population. Since
2001, the number of people living below the $2-a-day line has
been reduced by some 225 million, an even larger reduction
than in the previous “boom” of 1991-96.

The Bank's strategy in the region is to support broadbased economic growth, promote trade and integration,

enhance the environment for good governance, increase
social stability, and help countries achieve the MDGs. To
meet these goals, the Bank approved $4 billion for the
region in fiscal 2007, including $2.8 billion in IBRD loans
and $1.2 billion in IDA credits and grants. Carbon Finance
contracts totaling $29 million were signed in 2007.

IMPROVING GOVERNANCE AND THE CLIMATE
FOR INVESTMENT
Groundbreaking work on governance and corruption continues
in the East Asia and Pacific region, with an emphasis placed
on building country capacity and strengthening public institutions. A $600 million development policy loan to Indonesia
is allowing the government to deepen reforms in four main
areas: macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness, public
financial management and governance, the investment climate,
and services for the poor. The operation brings together the
World Bank, the government of Japan, and the Asian Development Bank around a common policy framework.

In the Philippines, a $250 million development policy loan
supports the country’s significant achievements and further
